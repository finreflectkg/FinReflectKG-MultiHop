      "question": "How do Coca-Cola, Southern Company, and UPS each incorporate reinvested dividends into their shareholder value propositions or investment programs, and what specific roles do reinvested dividends play in each company's long-term financial strategy?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola includes reinvested dividends as a component of its Total Shareowner Return, which is used to measure performance against the S&P 500 Index and peer group over a five-year period. Southern Company accounts for reinvested interest and dividends as part of the fair value changes of its investment funds, indicating their importance in assessing investment performance net of expenses. UPS incorporates reinvested dividends into its Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP), where dividend equivalents are earned on outstanding Restricted Performance Units (RPUs), enhancing the value of long-term equity compensation. Collectively, reinvested dividends serve different strategic purposes: KO emphasizes shareholder return benchmarking, SO integrates them into investment performance reporting, and UPS links them to equity-based employee incentives.",

These figures reveal starkly different levels of exposure to market volatility: ADBE shows minimal impact with a small gain, MET reflects significant sensitivity with a large unrealized loss, and UNH demonstrates moderate exposure with a smaller but still notable unrealized loss.

      "answer": "BKNG highlights that increased shopping activity before travel purchases leads to higher traffic that is less likely to convert into bookings, thereby reducing marketing efficiency and increasing customer acquisition costs. COST notes that gasoline sales enhance warehouse traffic, contributing to in-store visits, though it carries a lower gross margin percentage compared to non-gasoline sales. HD reports that a majority of its digital traffic comes from mobile devices, and through investments in mobile app functionality and digital enhancements, it has achieved higher traffic, better conversion rates, and sales growth. Together, these perspectives show that BKNG views traffic as a cost-sensitive challenge, COST sees it as a physical store traffic driver with margin trade-offs, and HD treats digital traffic as a lever for engagement and conversion growth.",

          "chunk_text": "which have shown volatility and long-term deceleration of growth rates, may also impact growth rates for marketing channels. Any deterioration in our marketing efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, whether through reduced revenues or revenue growth, or through marketing expenses increasing faster than revenues, which would reduce margins and earnings growth.\n\nMany factors could cause consumers to increase their shopping activity before making a travel purchase. Increased shopping activity impedes our marketing efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes less likely to result in a reservation through our platforms, and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid marketing channels than through direct channels. Further, consumers may favor travel services offered by search or meta-search companies over OTCs, which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation platforms, increase consumer awareness of our competitors' brands and platforms, increase our marketing and other customer acquisition costs, and adversely affect our business, margins, and results of operations. To the extent any such increased shopping behavior leads to growth in our KAYAK meta-search business, such growth may not result in sufficient increases in revenues from our KAYAK meta-search business to offset any related decrease in revenues or increase in marketing and other customer acquisition costs experienced by our OTC brands.\n\nWe may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes.\n\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent new service announcements, introductions and enhancements, and changing consumer demands and preferences. These characteristics are changing at an even greater pace as OTCs and travel service providers seek to address consumer needs and preferences resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes. In addition, these market characteristics are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various markets, including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geographies and the growth of the use of smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices for mobile e-commerce transactions. New developments in other areas such as cloud computing could make entering our markets easier for competitors due to lower upfront technology costs. It is increasingly important for us to effectively offer our services on mobile devices through mobile apps and mobile-optimized websites and to tailor our services to varying devices and platforms. See below Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" Consumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates challenges and may enable device companies such as Google and Apple to compete directly with us .\" Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services and online platforms to evolving industry standards and local preferences, and to continually innovate and improve the performance, features, and reliability of our services and online platforms in response to competitive service offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace.\n\nAdditionally, our ability to achieve our long-term strategy to build the Connected Trip depends on successfully integrating and developing new and evolving technologies, which will require increased financial and personnel investments that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations until we achieve the expected return on these investments. While we believe that we have the ability to achieve our long-term strategy to build the Connected Trip, the development of the Connected Trip is subject to uncertainties, including further technical development of the flight, accommodation, and other verticals necessary for the Connected Trip experience, the ability to collect, store, and use customer data in a compliant and integrated fashion, and the attraction and retention of employees dedicated to this development effort. As a result, it may take longer than we expect to build the Connected Trip or it may not achieve the expected return on investment. Consumer demand for the Connected Trip may also not be sustained at the levels that we anticipate. These efforts may also not be successful in improving the travel experience or retaining and attracting new customers. Further, regulatory authorities may subject us to existing or new rules or restrictions that could prevent us from successfully commercializing the Connected Trip or expose us to unanticipated claims or liabilities. With any technical innovation such as the Connected Trip effort, there could be bugs, vulnerabilities and other system failures, which could result in lost business, harm to our brand or reputation, consumer complaints and other adverse consequences, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWe are working toward enhancing our payments capabilities, including by offering alternative payment solutions to consumers even when those payment solutions may not be accepted by the travel service provider or restaurant. Alternate payment providers such as Alipay, Paytm, and WeChat Pay operate closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both consumers and merchants. In many markets, particularly in Asia where credit cards are not readily available and/or e-commerce is largely carried out through mobile devices, these and other emerging alternative payment methods are the exclusive or preferred means of payment for many consumers. If we are unable to offer consumers their preferred method of payment by integrating new or emerging payment methods into our platforms, we may not be able to effectively offer our services to these consumers, which would limit our growth opportunities in these markets and our business and results of operations could be harmed.",

MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes  to  Financial  Statements  (Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K).  This  section  generally  discusses  the  results  of operations for  2022  compared to 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition  for  2021  compared  to  2020  refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  our  fiscal  year  2021  Form  10-K,  which  was  filed  with  the  United  States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline,  pharmacy,  optical,  food  court,  hearing  aids,  and  tire  installation)  and  other  businesses  (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members  and  the  amount  they  spend  on  each  visit  (average  ticket).  Sales  comparisons  can  also  be  particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international  operations);  inflation  and  changes  in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions.  The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&amp;A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins  are  also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a  wide  range  of  global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or  reliably  predict  general  economic  health  or  changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term  on  maximizing  prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our members of our 'pricing authority' - consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlierthan-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost  increases  on  to  our  members.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  may  include  reducing  prices  on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).\n\nWe  believe  our  gasoline  business  enhances  traffic  in  our  warehouses,  but  it  generally  has  a  lower  gross  margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&amp;A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-",

Enhancements to our digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who research products online and check available inventory before going into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate and then make their purchase in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our investments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical retail presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in our digital channels is on a mobile device. Mobile customers expect more simplicity and relevancy in their digital interactions. As a result, we have made significant investments to our digital properties to improve the overall presentation and ease of navigation for the user. We have also enhanced the 'shopability' of an online product by including more information on the product's landing page, including related products and/or parts of a collection, and a multitude of fulfillment options. Our focus on improving search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation, product content, speed to checkout, and enhanced fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic, better conversion and continued sales growth. It has also been critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers have gravitated even more to the digital environment.\n\nFurther, we do not view the interconnected shopping experience as a specific transaction; rather, we believe it encompasses an entire journey from inspiration and know-how, to purchase and fulfillment, to post-purchase care and support. Customers expect more personalized messaging, so we are focusing on connecting marketing activities with the online and in-store experiences to create a seamless series of engagements across channels. From the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product know-how, we are continuing to invest in the infrastructure and capabilities needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important for them today.\n\nStore Experience. Our stores remain the hub of our business, and we are investing to improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and increasing the convenience and speed of checkout. For several years, our associates have used web-enabled handheld devices we call 'GET phones' to help expedite the online order checkout process, locate products in the aisles and online, and check inventory on hand. To improve the customer's experience in our stores, we have also empowered our customers with additional self-help tools, including mobile app-enabled store navigation. Our app provides store-specific maps, which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we leveraged the investments made in our stores over the past several years to operate effectively in the dynamic environment we faced throughout the year. These investments include our wayfinding sign and store refresh package in all of our U.S. stores; our self-service lockers, online order storage areas at front entrances, and curbside pickup, which offer convenient pickup options for online orders; electronic shelf label capabilities; and the re-design of the front-end area, including reconfigured service desks, improved layouts in all checkout areas, and expanded and enhanced self-checkout options. We believe these investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, and we will continue to invest to improve the customer experience going forward.\n\nInvesting in Associate Productivity. We continually strive to improve our store operations for our associates. Our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. To this end, we have continued to focus our efforts in such areas as optimizing product flow to decrease the amount of time a store associate spends locating product and to improve on-shelf product availability; creating a simpler order management system; expanding in-aisle, real-time mobile learning tools for our associates' own development and to assist with customer questions; and using labor model tools to better align associate activity with customer needs.\n\nInvesting in Safety. We are committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates. We empower trained EH&amp;S associates to evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EH&amp;S policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate's role and responsibilities; and awareness,",

GOOGL reports a significant rise in Total Cost of Revenues from $133,332 million in 2023 to $146,306 million in 2024, reflecting aggressive investment in operations and platform scaling. TSLA, in contrast, shows only a modest increase from $79,113 million to $80,240 million in 2024, suggesting tighter cost control despite scaling production and expanding into energy segments. These trends highlight differing strategic approaches: CRM's measured growth, GOOGL's aggressive scaling, and TSLA's cost discipline.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each reflect the influence of Production Tax Credits (PTC) on their renewable energy strategies, particularly in light of the phase-out schedule for wind energy PTCs outlined by NEE and the glossary definitions provided by DUK and SO?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) defines Production Tax Credits (PTC) in its glossary, indicating its foundational understanding of the tax incentive mechanism relevant to renewable energy development. Southern Company (SO) also defines PTC in its glossary, signaling its awareness and potential utilization of the credit in its energy portfolio. NextEra Energy (NEE), however, provides the most detailed and strategic insight by disclosing the PTC phase-out schedule for wind energy projects, showing a 100% credit in 2016 declining to 60% in 2020 and beyond, which directly impacts project economics and timing. This comparative analysis reveals that while DUK and SO frame PTC at a definitional level, NEE actively incorporates the PTC phase-out timeline into its capital planning and renewable energy deployment strategy, suggesting a more proactive adaptation to federal tax policy changes.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 PTC: DUK defines PTC in its glossary, indicating awareness and relevance to its operations, but does not provide strategic or quantitative details.",

        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 PTC: SO also includes PTC in its glossary, showing recognition of the term but without strategic or numerical context."

      "answer": "BNY Mellon identifies sustainability concerns and broader reputational risks as potential negative influences on client activity levels, which could disrupt its business operations. Goldman Sachs emphasizes that its earnings are highly dependent on global financial market conditions, which directly influence client activity levels and creditworthiness, making its business particularly sensitive to economic volatility. Charles Schwab explicitly states its need to 'support client activity levels' as a key operational capability, linking it to its ability to manage expenses and maintain infrastructure. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three firms are impacted by client activity levels, their sensitivity and strategic focus differ: BNY Mellon highlights reputational and regulatory risks, Goldman Sachs underscores market-driven volatility, and Charles Schwab centers on internal capacity to sustain client engagement.",

These conditions can change suddenly and negatively.\n\nOur  financial  performance  is  highly  dependent  on  the  environment  in which  our  businesses  operate.  A favorable business environment  is generally characterized by, among  other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent,  liquid  and  efficient  capital  markets,  low  inflation,  business, consumer  and  investor  confidence,  stable  geopolitical  conditions  and strong business earnings.\n\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by:  low  levels  of  or  declines  in  economic  growth,  business  activity  or investor,  business  or  consumer  confidence;  concerns  over  a  potential recession; changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns; pandemics; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate  or  basic  commodity  price  volatility  or  default  rates;  high  levels  of inflation or stagflation; concerns about U.S. and other sovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy, government shutdowns, debt  ceilings  or  funding;  the  extent  of  and  uncertainty  about  potential changes  in  tax  rates  and  regulatory  changes;  limitations  on  international trade and travel; changes in immigration policies; laws and regulations that limit  trading  in,  or  the  issuance  of,  securities  of  issuers  outside  their domestic  markets;  outbreaks  or  worsening  of  domestic  or  international tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cybersecurity threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication, energy transmission or transportation  networks  or  other geopolitical instability or uncertainty; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or other natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\n\nThe  financial  services  industry  and  the  securities  and  other  financial markets  have  been  materially  and  adversely  affected  in  the  past  by significant  declines  in  the  values  of  nearly  all  asset  classes,  by  a  severe lack  of  liquidity  and  by  high  levels  of  borrower  defaults.  In  addition, concerns about actual or potential increases in interest rates, inflation and other borrowing costs, a public health emergency, sovereign debt risk and its  impact  on  the  relevant  sovereign  banking  system,  and  limitations  on international trade, have, at times, negatively impacted the levels of client activity.\n\nGeneral  uncertainty  about  economic,  political  and  market  activities,  and the  scope,  timing  and  impact  of  regulatory  reform,  as  well  as  weak consumer, investor and CEO confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, has in the past negatively impacted client activity, which has in  the  past  adversely  affected  and  could  in  the  future  adversely  affect many  of  our  businesses.  Periods  of  low  volatility  and  periods  of  high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity have at times had an unfavorable impact on our market-making businesses.\n\nChanges, or proposed changes, to U.S. international trade and investment policies, particularly with important trading partners, have in recent years negatively  impacted  financial  markets.  Continued  or  escalating  tensions may  result  in  further  actions  taken  by  the  U.S.  or  other  countries  that could  disrupt  international  trade  and  investment  and  adversely  affect financial markets. Those actions could include, among  others, the implementation  of  or  increase  in  sanctions,  tariffs  or  foreign  exchange measures,  the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury  securities or other restrictions  on  cross-border  trade,  investment,  or  transfer  of  information or technology. Such developments have in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our or our clients' businesses.\n\nFinancial  institution  returns  may  be  negatively  impacted  by  increased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial institutions  in  countries  in  which  governmental  support  is  maintained.  In addition, liquidity in the financial markets has in the past been, and could in the  future  be,  negatively  impacted  as  market  participants  and  market practices and structures adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks.",

We maintained these valuation allowances following our conclusion that we could not demonstrate that it was more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized. This was primarily due to factors such as cumulative losses in recent years and the inability to demonstrate profits within the specific jurisdictions over the relevant carryforward periods.\n\n## TAX EXAMINATIONS AND LITIGATION\n\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our eligible U.S. subsidiaries. Income earned by subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is taxed, and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable U.S. and foreign laws.\n\nWe are currently under examination by the IRS for the tax years 2011 through 2013.\n\nIn September 2020, we received the IRS Revenue Agent Report containing agreed and disagreed issues for the audit of tax years 2007-2010. In October 2020, we filed a protest of the disagreed issues with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (IRS Appeals). In March 2021, the IRS audit team issued their rebuttal to the protest of disagreed issues to IRS Appeals. We had an IRS Appeals conference in October 2021 and are continuing to engage in the Appeals process.\n\nIn 2009, after paying amounts due on a statutory notice of deficiency related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions, we filed a refund lawsuit in the Southern District of New York (Southern District) with respect to tax year 1997. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the parties executed a binding settlement agreement with respect to the underlying issues in the lawsuit. On October 22, 2020, the Southern District dismissed the case based upon the settlement reached between AIG and the government. The parties continue to review the related interest calculations based on the settlement agreement, which will become due upon the IRS' issuance of a Notice and Demand for Payment. During June 2021 and October 2021, AIG made additional payments of $354 million and $10 million to the U.S. Treasury with respect to this matter.\n\n## ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nPayments  for  commercial  aircraft  sales  are  received  in  accordance  with  the  customer  agreement,  which  generally includes a deposit upon order and additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due  immediately  prior  to  or  at  aircraft  delivery.  Advances  and  progress  billings  (contract  liabilities)  are  normal  and customary for commercial aircraft contracts and not considered a significant financing component as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.\n\nLong-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the U.S.  government  and  other  customers  that  generally  extend  over  several  years.  Products  sales  under  long-term contracts  primarily  include  fighter  jets,  rotorcraft,  cybersecurity  products,  surveillance  suites,  advanced  weapons, missile defense, military derivative aircraft, satellite systems and modification of commercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighters. Services sales under long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associated with our commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew.\n\nFor each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standalone selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain longterm contracts may be modified over their life, the transaction price is based on current rights and obligations under the contract and does not include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price for  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government.  Certain  long-term  contracts  include  in  the  transaction  price  variable consideration,  such  as  incentive  and  award  fees,  if  specified  targets  are  achieved.  The  amount  included  in  the transaction price represents the expected value, based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.\n\nLong-term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are  produced  or  as  services  are  rendered.  We  generally  recognize  revenue  over  time  as  we  perform  on  long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer  of  control  to  the  customer  is  supported  by  clauses  in  the  contract  that  allow  the  customer  to  unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in  process.  Similarly,  for  non-U.S.  government  contracts,  the  customer  typically  controls  the  work  in  process  as evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do not have an alternative use to the Company.\n\nThe accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales, costs and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing revenue as costs are incurred provides an objective measure of progress on the long-term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.\n\nFor long-term contracts for which revenue is recognized over time, changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current  period  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  changes  on  current  and  prior  periods  based  on  a  long-term  contract's percentage-of-completion.

          "chunk_text": "## Fair Value of Debt\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the estimated fair value of the outstanding debt was approximately $12.1 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, and was considered a \"Level 2\" fair value measurement (see Note 6). Fair value was estimated based upon actual trades at the end of the reporting period or the most recent trade available as well as the Company's stock price at the end of the reporting period. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount at December 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily relates to the conversion premium on the Convertible Senior Notes and the outstanding Senior Notes due April 2030.\n\n## Convertible Senior Notes\n\nIf the note holders exercise their option to convert, the Company delivers cash to repay the principal amount of the notes and delivers shares of common stock or cash, at its option, to satisfy the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. If the Company's convertible debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity, a gain or loss on extinguishment is recognized. The gain or loss is the difference between the fair value of the debt component immediately prior to extinguishment and its carrying value. To estimate the fair value of the debt at the conversion date, the Company estimates the borrowing rate, considering the credit rating and similar debt of comparable corporate issuers without the conversion feature.\n\n## Description of Convertible Senior Notes\n\nIn April 2020, the Company issued $863 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due May 2025 with an interest rate of 0.75% (the \"May 2025 Notes\"). The Company paid $19 million in debt issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to this offering. The May 2025 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $1,886.44 per share. The May 2025 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, prior to November 1, 2024, upon the occurrence of specific events, including but not limited to a change in control, or if the closing sales price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the conversion price in effect for the notes on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter. In the event that all or substantially all of the Company's common stock is acquired on or prior to the maturity of the May 2025 Notes in a transaction in which the consideration paid to holders of the Company's common stock consists of all or substantially all cash, the Company would be required to make additional payments in the form of additional shares of common stock to the holders of the May 2025 Notes in an aggregate value ranging from $0 to $235 million depending upon the date of the transaction and the then current stock price of the Company. Starting on November 1, 2024, holders will have the right to convert all or any portion of the May 2025 Notes, regardless of the Company's stock price. The May 2025 Notes may not be redeemed by the Company prior to maturity. The holders may require the Company to repurchase the May 2025 Notes for cash in certain circumstances. Interest on the May 2025 Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. At December 31, 2021, the if-converted value of the May 2025 Notes exceeded the aggregate principal amount by $166 million.\n\nIn August 2014, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due September 2021, with an interest rate of 0.9% (the \"September 2021 Notes\"). In September 2021, in connection with the maturity of the September 2021 Notes, the Company paid $1.0 billion to satisfy the aggregate principal amount due and an additional $86 million conversion premium in excess of the principal amount.\n\nIn May 2013, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due June 2020, with an interest rate of 0.35% (the \"June 2020 Notes\"). In June 2020, in connection with the maturity of the outstanding June 2020 Notes, the Company paid $1.0 billion to satisfy the aggregate principal amount due and an additional $245 million conversion premium in excess of the principal amount.\n\nCash-settled convertible debt, such as the Company's convertible senior notes, is separated into debt and equity components at issuance and each component is assigned a value. The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value, at the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature. The difference between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, representing the value assigned to the equity component, is recorded as a debt discount. Debt discount is amortized using the effective interest rate method over the period from the origination date through the stated maturity date. The Company estimated the borrowing rates at debt origination to be 4.10% for the May 2025 Notes, 3.18% for the September 2021 Notes and 3.13% for the June 2020 Notes, considering its credit rating and similar debt of the Company or comparable corporate issuers without the conversion feature.

All deriv ativ es receiv ing hedge accounting are cash flow hedges. The majority of hedging gains and losses deferred as of September 30, 2024 are expected to be recognized ov er the next 12 months as the underlying forecasted transactions occur. Gains and losses on foreign currency deriv ativ es reported in Other deductions, net reflect hedges of balance sheet exposures that do not receiv e hedge accounting. Cash flows related to foreign currency hedges are classified within operating cash flows.\n\n## Net Investment Hedge\n\nIn 2019, the Company issued euro-denominated debt of \u20ac1.5 billion, of which \u20ac500 was repaid in 2024. The outstanding euro notes reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency and hav e been designated as a hedge of a portion of the inv estment in these operations. Foreign currency gains or losses associated with the euro-denominated debt are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will remain until the hedged inv estment is sold or substantially liquidated. Cash flows related to the euro-denominated debt are classified within financing cash flows.\n\nThe following gains and losses are included in earnings and other comprehensiv e income (OCI):\n\n",

For equity method investments, we record impairment losses in earnings only when impairments are considered other-thantemporary.\n\nDerivatives. Our primary objectives for holding derivative instruments are to manage foreign exchange risk for certain foreign currency revenues, operating expenses, receivables and payables and to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalents, marketable securities and long-term debt. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and included in other current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity dates. Counterparties to these derivative instruments are all major banking institutions. At September 29, 2024, the aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments recorded in total assets and in total liabilities were $30 million and $138 million, respectively. At September 24, 2023, the aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments recorded in total assets and in total liabilities were $32 million and $317 million, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Hedges: We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties, that may or may not be designated as hedging instruments. These derivative instruments generally have maturity dates between one and 24 months. Gains and losses arising from such contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of income taxes. The hedging gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are subsequently reclassified to revenues or costs and expenses, as applicable, in the consolidated statements of operations in the same period in which the underlying transactions affect our earnings. For foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments, the changes in fair value are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net in the period of change.\n\nThe cash flows associated with such derivative instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, which is the same category as the hedged transaction.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps: From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements that allow us to effectively convert fix ed-rate payments into floating-rate payments on portions of our outstanding long-term debt. We enter into these agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with our cash equivalents and marketable securities, in addition to changes in the fair value of our outstanding debt. These transactions are designated as fair value hedges, and the gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in the market interest rates. The net gains and losses on the interest rate swaps, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the related fix ed-rate debt attributable to the hedged risks, are recognized as interest ex pense in the current period. The interest settlement payments associated with the interest rate swap agreements are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFrom time to time, we also enter into forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on certain anticipated debt issuances. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. The gains and losses arising from such contracts are recorded as a component in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as gains and losses on derivative instruments. When the anticipated debt is issued, any associated swaps are terminated, and the hedging gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recorded to interest expense over the term of the hedged portions of the related debt issued.\n\nGross Notional Amounts: The gross notional amounts of our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives by instrument type were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

MO does not disclose a health care cost trend rate for pension plans but reports a 6.5% assumed rate for postretirement benefits, with an ultimate trend rate of 5.0% expected by 2031. PM reports a 6.54% health care cost trend rate for its postretirement benefits, with an ultimate trend rate of 4.49% expected to be reached by 2047.

In contrast, Duke Energy disclosed a significantly higher notional amount of $2,300 million specifically allocated to cash flow hedges, suggesting a more aggressive hedging strategy. Nike, on the other hand, showed a fluctuating pattern with cash flow hedges valued at $431 million by the end of 2023, but with notable reclassifications and volatility during the year.

While production in certain lines of business continues to remain near or below preCOVID-19 levels, the global economic recovery, although uneven, is having a positive impact on consumer and business demand across our Commercial Lines and Personal Insurance businesses. The overall results of General Insurance for 2021 reflect continued strong performance from our Commercial Lines portfolio and positive momentum within Personal Insurance. Across our North America and International Commercial Lines of business we have seen increased demand for our insurance products with improvement in rates as well as terms and conditions. We continue to monitor inflationary impacts resulting from government stimulus, sharp increases in demand, labor force and supply chain disruptions, among other factors, on rate adequacy and loss cost trends. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business will likely be influenced by the evolution of the virus and its potential to further impact the global economy.\n\n## General Insurance - North America\n\nThe North America business remains in a firm market with common drivers being higher industry-wide claims severity trends driven by social and economic inflation, higher natural catastrophe losses over recent years driven by increasing loss frequency and severity (in part connected to climate change), the uncertain impact of COVID-19 and the low interest rate environment. While market discipline continues to support price increases across most lines (outside of Workers' Compensation), we are seeing capacity move back into the market in certain segments given the improved pricing levels. We have focused on retaining our best accounts which has led to improving retention across the portfolio. These retention rates are often coupled with an exposure limit management strategy to reduce volatility within the portfolio. We continue to proactively identify segment growth areas as market conditions warrant through effective portfolio management, while non-renewing unprofitable business.\n\nPersonal Insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. We compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, AIG amended a distribution agreement with one of its largest travel insurance distributors. Following the effectiveness of the amendments, the revised agreement no longer represents a risk transfer transaction and as such is accounted for under deposit accounting.\n\n90 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly. In addition, evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or cross-border transmission of data, including for regulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our customers' ability to  use,  and  our  ability  to  sell,  our  products  and  services.  The  interpretation  and  application  of  these  laws  in  some  instances  is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes. For example, the European Union's ('EU') General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU and imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Additionally, we are subject to California's Consumer Privacy Act and other laws, regulations and obligations that relate to the handling  of  personal  data.  Our  actual  or  perceived  failure  to  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  or  other  obligations relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could subject us to liability to  our  customers,  data  subjects,  suppliers,  business  partners,  employees,  and  others,  give  rise  to  legal  and/or  regulatory  action, could damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n## Our  business,  operating  results  and  financial  condition  could  be  materially  harmed  by  evolving  regulatory  uncertainty  or obligations applicable to our products and services.\n\nChanges in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate, in the United States and in other countries, could  materially  affect  the  sales  of  our  products  and  services.  In  particular,  economic  sanctions  and  changes  to  export  control requirements,  have  impacted  and  may  continue  to  impact  our  ability  to  sell  and  support  our  products  and  services  in  certain jurisdictions. In addition, changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our service provider customers' purchase of our products and services, and they could also impact sales of our own regulated offerings. Additional areas of uncertainty that could impact  sales  of  our  products  and  services  include  laws  and  regulations  related  to  encryption  technology,  environmental sustainability  (including  climate  change),  human  rights,  product  certification,  and  national  security  controls  applicable  to  our supply chain. For example, new laws and regulations in response to climate change could result in increased energy efficiency requirements for our products and increased compliance and energy costs. Changes in regulatory requirements in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\n\n## Our stock price may be volatile.\n\nHistorically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial  results  and  the  published  expectations  of  analysts  and  as  a  result  of  announcements  by  our  competitors  and  us. Furthermore,  speculation  in  the  press  or  investment  community  about  our  strategic  position,  financial  condition,  results  of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the  market  price  of  our  common  stock  in  the  future. Additionally,  volatility,  lack  of  positive  performance  in  our  stock  price  or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.",

          "chunk_text": "As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing  business model  includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able  to  successfully  manage  the  impacts  of  these  activities, while at the same  time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results have been, and in the future could be, adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from  the  loss  of  earnings  associated  with  divested  brands  or dissolution  of  joint  ventures.  Our  results  of  operations  and cash  flows  have  been,  and  in  the  future  could  also  be, impacted  by  acquisitions  or  joint  venture  activities,  if:  1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2)  we  are  not  able  to  deliver  the  expected  cost  and  growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges,  which  could  also  result  in  an  impairment  of goodwill and intangible assets.\n\nOur business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational  change,  including  attracting  and  retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning.\n\nOur financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments and  employee  departures.  Failure  to  deliver  these  planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to  invest  in  business  growth,  could  adversely  impact  our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, successfully executing  organizational  change,  management  transitions  at leadership levels of the Company and motivation and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. Factors that  may  affect  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of  qualified  individuals.  Our  success  depends  on  identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted  leadership  and  direction  for  our  business.  This includes  developing  and  retaining  organizational  capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced  employees  may  be  limited  and  competition  for these resources is intense as well as continuing the development  and  execution  of  robust  leadership  succession plans.\n\n## LEGAL &amp; REGULATORY RISKS\n\nWe must successfully manage compliance with current and expanding  laws  and  regulations,  as  well  as  manage  new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nOur  business is subject to a wide  variety of  laws  and regulations  across  the  countries  in  which  we  do  business, including  those  laws  and  regulations  involving  intellectual property, product liability, product composition or formulation, packaging  content  or  corporate  responsibility  after  consumer purchase,  marketing,  antitrust  and  competition,  privacy,  data protection,  environmental  (including  increasing  focus  on  the climate, water and waste impacts of consumer packaged goods companies' operations and products), employment,  healthcare, anti-bribery, anticorruption, trade (including tariffs, sanctions and export controls),  tax,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  or  other matters.  In  addition,  increasing  governmental  and  societal attention  to  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG) matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting,  diligence  and  disclosure  on  topics  such  as  climate change,  waste  production,  water  usage,  human  capital,  labor and risk oversight, could expand  the nature, scope  and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. These and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement  actions  by  various  governmental  and  regulatory agencies,  create  challenges  for  the  Company,  including  our compliance and ethics programs, may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance,  which  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of operations  and  cash  flows.  If  we  are  unable  to  continue  to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our  reputation  and  our  business  results. Additionally,  we  are currently,  and  in  the  future  may  be,  subject  to  a  number  of inquiries, investigations, claims, proceedings and requests for information from governmental agencies or private parties, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business. Failure to  successfully  manage  these  new  or  pending  regulatory  and legal  matters  and  resolve  such  matters  without  significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Furthermore,  if  new  or  pending  legal  or  regulatory matters  result  in  fines  or  costs  in  excess  of  the  amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position.\n\n## Changes  in applicable tax laws and regulations  and resolutions  of  tax  disputes  could  negatively  affect  our financial results.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred  to  as  the  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs Act  (the  U.S. Tax Act). The  changes  included  in  the  U.S.  Tax  Act  were  broad  and complex.  Under  the  current  U.S.  presidential  administration, comprehensive federal income tax reform has been proposed, including an increase in the U.S. Federal corporate income tax rate,  elimination  of  certain  investment  incentives  and  a  more than doubling of U.S. residual taxation of non-U.S. earnings. While  these  proposals  are  controversial,  likely  to  change during the legislative process and may prove difficult to enact as proposed in the current closely divided U.S. Congress, their impact could nonetheless be significant.\n\nAdditionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential  evolution.

GD had no proceeds from commercial paper in 2023, contrasting with prior-year activity of $1,997 million, suggesting a reduced reliance on this funding source. MDT experienced a $1.1 billion increase in commercial paper issued, contributing to a $510 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities, showing a strategic use of short-term debt.

      "question": "How do ADBE, AMGN, and MDT each characterize the role and impact of royalty expense on their financial performance in 2023, and what does this reveal about their respective business models and cost structures?",
      "answer": "ADBE reports royalty expense of $246 million in fiscal 2023, reflecting licensing costs tied to product offerings and indicating a cost structure influenced by third-party IP licensing. AMGN notes an increase in royalty expense as part of broader operating costs, driven by product mix changes and acquisition-related activities, suggesting a growing burden from licensing obligations. MDT includes royalty expense as a component of 'Other Operating Expense (Income), Net,' showing it as part of a broader cost framework that includes restructuring and acquisition-related charges, indicating a more integrated and fluctuating cost base. Collectively, these perspectives reveal differing degrees of dependency on external IP and varying impacts on operational costs across the three firms.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy recorded a favorable federal tax adjustment of $114 million and a favorable state adjustment of $6 million related to the deductibility of interest on company-owned life insurance, and also recognized $28 million in PTCs under the IRA. Home Depot reported an income tax adjustment of $5,205 million in fiscal 2023, significantly reducing its effective tax burden and impacting NOPAT and ROIC metrics. Medtronic incurred a $187 million tax charge due to a deemed taxable IP transfer in Israel, along with additional tax costs totaling $299 million from valuation allowance changes and tax rate adjustments. These differences highlight varied sources and timing of tax adjustments: DUK benefited from internal tax analysis and policy changes, HD experienced a major tax-driven earnings adjustment, and MDT faced significant international tax liabilities.",

Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities further described below, and our legacy products, services and solutions are contained within the third segment, Publishing and Advertising.\n\n## MARKET OVERVIEW\n\nThis overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2025 and beyond for each of our segments.

Everyone has a story to tell and needs products and services at their fingertips to tell those stories on an ever-increasing number of canvases. AI- and generative AI-powered technologies are increasing this opportunity by growing the demand for and production of content. This shift is changing how creative professionals work by accelerating their processes, increasing their productivity, and allowing them to explore and create in new fields, while empowering new creators by dramatically lowering barriers to creativity. At the same time, creativity is increasingly a team effort that is redefining productivity, making quick and easy collaboration even more critical to every company's success. Adobe is driving innovation to shape these trends, democratize creativity, empower individuals to create wherever inspiration strikes and enable more effective collaboration between creators and stakeholders.\n\nThe  flagship  of  our  Digital  Media  business  is Adobe  Creative  Cloud,  a  subscription  service  that  allows  subscribers  to  use  our  creative  products  and applications ('Apps') integrated with cloud-delivered services across various surfaces and platforms. We believe in creativity for all, and Creative Cloud addresses the needs of all content creators, from creative professionals, such as artists, designers, developers, students, and administrators, to knowledge workers, marketers, educators,  enthusiasts,  communicators,  and  consumers.  Our  customers  rely  on  our  products  for  content  creation,  photo  editing,  design,  video  and  animation production, mobile App and gaming development, and more. Our customers can choose between products optimized for different platforms and capabilities, from the speed and ease of use offered by Adobe Express, our AI-first, task-based web and mobile App, to the greater power and precision of our flagship Creative Cloud Apps.  We believe we have significant opportunities to grow our  Digital  Media business by advancing every creative category across all surfaces; expanding content-first, task-based creativity with Adobe Express; enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders; inspiring the creative community through sharing and monetization; and expanding the user base of our tools through the infusion of AI into our products, services and solutions to enable users of any skill level to easily and efficiently create content.\n\nOur  Digital  Media  segment  includes  our Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  a  unified,  cloud-based  document  services  platform  that  integrates Adobe's pioneering PDF technology with our Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Acrobat Sign Apps to deliver fully digital document workflows across all surfaces. We have the opportunity to continue to accelerate document productivity with Adobe Document Cloud and transform how people view, share, collaborate, and engage with documents. Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, reflecting the important role PDF plays globally.

We  also  face  risks  associated  with  our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word 'Google' could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word 'search.' Some courts have ruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word 'Google' to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\n\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensiv e to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\n\nOur strong brands hav e significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Serv ices, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innov ativ e products and serv ices that better serv e the needs of our users, adv ertisers, customers, content prov iders, and other partners. Our brands hav e been, and may in the future be, negativ ely affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data priv acy and security issues and developments,  and  product  or  technical  performance  failures.  For  example,  if  we  fail  to  respond  appropriately  to  the  sharing  of  misinformation  or objectionable content on our serv ices and/or products or objectionable practices by adv ertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.\n\nFurthermore,  failure  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  brands  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results.  Our success  will  depend  largely  on  our  ability  to  remain  a  technology  leader  and  continue  to  prov ide  high-quality,  trustworthy,  innov ativ e  products  and serv ices that are truly useful and play a v aluable role in a range of settings.\n\n## We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our serv ices.\n\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our dev ices as well as serv ers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to supply components and distribute our products and serv ices. Our business could be negativ ely affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adv erse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.",

We cannot guarantee that the repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The repurchase program and dividend payments could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this repurchase program or dividend payments may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this repurchase program and dividend payments will diminish our cash reserves.\n\n## There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.\n\nThe payment of any cash dividends in the future is subject to continued capital availability, market conditions, applicable laws and agreements, and our board of directors continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. The declaration and payment of any dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time, and there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.\n\n## Risks Related to Government Regulation and E nforcement\n\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or moderate content on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell or deliver advertising in their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\n\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an ex tended period of time or indefinitely. For ex ample, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. Hong Kong has passed additional national security legislation in 2024. In addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.\n\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell or deliver advertising, including in countries where access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a small number of resellers serving advertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese, United States, or other government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, including any tariffs implemented by the United States or China, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level of  advertising  by  marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.",

      "answer": "COP reported total proved reserves of 6,758 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) in 2023, with significant growth in Canada and the Lower 48, indicating a focus on North American unconventional and conventional assets. CVX disclosed total proved reserves of 4,423 MMBOE in liquids and 30,864 billion cubic feet of natural gas, showing a more globally diversified portfolio with strong positions in the U.S., Africa, and Asia. XOM reported total proved reserves of 16,928 MMBOE (oil-equivalent), with a notable decline in U.S. natural gas reserves but sustained investments in equity companies in Asia, suggesting a long-term strategic emphasis on international upstream opportunities. Collectively, these differences highlight COP\u2019s North American focus, CVX\u2019s balanced global exposure, and XOM\u2019s international upstream prioritization.",

GE highlights that separation transactions could negatively impact its ability to maintain consistent shareholder distributions due to potential tax liabilities, increased volatility, and reduced diversification post-spinoff. XOM frames shareholder distributions as part of its broader cash flow strategy, combining operating cash flow with asset sale proceeds to fund distributions, reflecting a disciplined divestment approach to maintain financial flexibility. Together, these perspectives show CVX prioritizing stability, GE facing structural constraints, and XOM leveraging asset sales to support distributions.",

          "chunk_text": "on a different timeline than expected. If we are unable to complete any of the separations, we will have incurred costs without realizing the benefits of such transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies. And, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the Company's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect to incur non-U.S. cash taxes on the preparatory restructuring and may also incur non-cash tax expense including potential impairments of deferred tax assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will qualify as taxfree for U.S. purposes. If the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we would incur a significant tax liability, while the distributions to the Company's shareholders would become taxable and the new independent companies might incur income tax liabilities as well. Furthermore, if the separation transactions are completed, we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful.\n\nWhether or not the separation transactions are completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of the Company; appropriately allocating assets and liabilities among the three companies, particularly given the staggered nature of the separation transactions; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing or attracting new business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties; assigning customer contracts and intellectual property to each of the businesses; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets. In particular, GE for the past several years has been undertaking various restructuring and business transformation actions (including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives) that have entailed changes across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. This poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial targets, loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation, and these risks are heightened with the additional interdependent actions that will be needed to complete the planned separation transactions. Moreover, completion of the separation transactions will result in the three independent public companies that are smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than GE is today. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company's results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Each of the separate companies will also incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. If the separation transactions are completed, investors holding our common stock may sell the common stock of any of the new independent companies that do not match their investment strategies, which may cause a decline in the market price of such common stock.\n\nCOVID-19 - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. Our operations and financial performance since early 2020 have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused, and may continue to cause, a slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect economic activity globally or in various regions, the extent to which this will adversely impact our future operations and financial performance is uncertain. Across all of our businesses, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, site shutdowns, workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at those of our customers and suppliers, global supply chain disruptions and price inflation. We also have experienced, and may continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for products and services, customer requests for potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications, supply chain under-liquidation, delays of deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones, delays or cancellations of new projects and related down payments and other factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on our customers that adversely impact our businesses. In particular, interruptions of regional and international air travel from COVID-19 are having a material adverse effect on our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our services and products. While our Aviation business is showing continued signs of recovery, the recently renewed intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic in many parts of the world could stall the recovery achieved to date and lead to future requests for payment deferrals, contract modifications, and similar actions across the aviation sector, which may lead to additional charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts, or to customer disputes.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the impact of coronavirus variants and resurgences; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and workforce pressures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines; our employees' compliance with vaccine mandates that may apply in various jurisdictions; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace and extent of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A number of accounting estimates that we make have been and will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties related to these and other factors, and our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 (see Note 1). As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described below.",

These definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation.\n\n## Cash Flow From Operations and Asset Sales\n\nCash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources of cash both from operating the Corporation's assets and from the divesting of assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that assets are contributing to the Corporation's strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.\n\n",

MO provides detailed pension and postretirement benefit disclosures, showing a funded status of $463 million for pensions in 2024, with $136 million listed under 'Accrued pension costs.' PM, in contrast, shows $384 million in accrued pension costs as part of its deferred income tax assets for 2024, suggesting a different accounting treatment tied to tax implications. Together, these disclosures reveal varying degrees of pension liability exposure and distinct financial strategies for managing retirement obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Accrued Pension Costs: DUK includes accrued pension and other post-retirement benefit costs directly on its consolidated balance sheets, indicating explicit recognition of these liabilities.",

        "Hop 3: PM \u2192 Accrued Pension Costs: PM reports $384 million in accrued pension costs as part of deferred income tax assets, suggesting a tax-asset offset strategy rather than direct liability recognition."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2024 completed as of October 1, 2024, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2024, 3M had 16 primary reporting units, with five reporting units accounting for approximately 85 percent of the goodwill. These five reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Commercial Branding and Transportation, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, and Personal Safety.\n\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M's businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M's focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M's value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\n\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2025 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\nUncertainty in Income Tax Positions: The extent of 3M's operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final tax es paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with tax ing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax  audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax  liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the ex tent to which, additional tax es will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income tax es, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 11 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company's current estimate of the tax  liabilities. If the Company's estimate of tax  liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to ex pense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax  benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Financial Condition and Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of 3M's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provide financial flexibility to deploy capital in accordance with the Company's stated priorities and meet needs associated with contractual commitments and other obligations. Investing in 3M's business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 11 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, 3M owned 19.9% of Solventum Corporation common stock which ownership interest's fair value was $2.3 billion. As previously disclosed, 3M intends to divest its ownership in Solventum within five years from its April 2024 spin-off.\n\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M's commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.8 billion commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\nTotal debt: The strength of 3M's credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company's debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio , including scheduled maturities in the next 12 months as referenced in Note 14. As of the date of this report, 3M has a credit rating of A3, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, a credit rating of BBB+, negative outlook from S&amp;P Global Ratings, and a credit rating of A-, stable outlook from Fitch.\n\nThe Company's total debt associated with continuing operations at December 31, 2024 decreased when compared to December 31, 2023 as a result of $2.9 billion in debt maturities, consisting of $1.1 billion of medium-term notes and $1.8 billion repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Amounts borrowed by Solventum during the first quarter of 2024 were a liability associated with discontinued operations and, as transferred obligations, became the sole responsibility of Solventum after the April 1, 2024 Separation, as discussed in Note 14.

In contrast, MO and PM both reference movements in OCE for the year ended December 31, 2021, but only provide narrative descriptions without disclosing the actual dollar amounts or specific components.

Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Allowance for Consumer Loans Receivable\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the total allowance for loans and interest receivable was $461 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $341 million relates to consumer loans receivable. The allowance for consumer loans receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data and incorporates macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The consumer loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, loan term, delinquency, credit rating, vintage, and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario to reflect the economic conditions applicable to a particular period.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for consumer loans receivable is a critical audit matter are (i) a high degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to certain consumer loss models, and for the revolving credit portfolio, forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales used to estimate expected credit losses; and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for consumer loans receivable, including controls over certain consumer loss models, and for the revolving credit portfolio, forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales used to estimate expected credit losses. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for determining the allowance for consumer loans receivable; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in the estimate; and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of certain methodologies and consumer loss models used by management and (b) for the revolving credit portfolio, the reasonableness of forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California February 4, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2000.",

Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets, and we generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for such assets recorded at fair value.\n\nOur primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposit; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar 'to-be-issued' securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.\n\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include interest rate swaps, securities sold but not yet purchased, and repurchase liabilities related to client-held fractional shares of equities, ETFs, and other securities, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Other securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased above in this Note 2 for the treatment of client-held fractional shares). The fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments for the repurchase liabilities to match the measurement and accounting of the related client-held fractional shares. The fair values of the repurchase liabilities are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data consistent with the related client-held fractional shares. Unrealized gains and losses on client-held fractional shares offset the unrealized gains and losses on the corresponding repurchase liabilities, resulting in no impact to the consolidated statements of income. The Company's liabilities to repurchase client-held fractional shares do not have credit risk, and, as a result, the Company has not recognized any gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income or comprehensive income attributable to instrument-specific credit risk for these repurchase liabilities. The repurchase liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps are based on market observable interest rate yield curves. Fair value measurements are priced considering the coupon rate of the fix ed leg of the contract and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. V aluation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve. The Company validates its valuations with counterparty quotations from central counterparty (CCP) clearing houses. See Note 17 for additional information on the Company's interest rate swaps.",

      "question": "How do AXP, EMR, and HON differ in their long-term debt repayment patterns in 2023, and what does this reveal about their respective capital structure strategies?",
      "answer": "AXP reported payments of long-term debt totaling $5,750 million in 2023, reflecting a consistent approach to debt reduction amid significant long-term debt issuance of $9,969 million. EMR made $741 million in long-term debt payments during the same period, showing a relatively modest level of debt servicing despite no new long-term debt issuance. HON, in contrast, paid $1,731 million in long-term debt during 2023, which was partially offset by long-term debt issuances of $2,986 million, indicating a more active debt refinancing strategy. These differences highlight AXP\u2019s focus on managing a large debt load, EMR\u2019s conservative debt approach, and HON\u2019s active capital structure management.",

        "Hop 2: EMR \u2192 Payments of Long-Term Debt: EMR paid $741 million in long-term debt during 2023, with no proceeds from new long-term debt issuance, suggesting a cautious approach to leveraging the balance sheet.",

      "question": "How do COP, CVX, and LOW each reflect the financial impact of the 1% excise tax on share repurchases in their 2023 financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their respective capital allocation strategies?",
      "answer": "COP explicitly records the excise tax on share repurchases as a $50 million charge in its 2023 equity statement, directly reducing treasury stock balances. CVX notes the inclusion of the excise tax in its capital in excess of par value, though without a specific dollar amount, indicating a more generalized treatment of the tax impact. LOW recognizes the excise tax as part of the cost basis of shares acquired under its repurchase program, aligning with the Inflation Reduction Act's requirement for the 1% tax on net share repurchases after December 31, 2022. This comparative analysis reveals that COP and LOW incorporate the tax directly into their equity transactions, while CVX appears to absorb it within broader capital adjustments, suggesting differing levels of granularity and strategic emphasis in their capital allocation disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Excise Tax on Share Repurchases: COP discloses a specific $50 million excise tax charge in its 2023 equity statement, directly tied to share repurchases.",
        "Hop 2: CVX \u2192 Excise Tax on Share Repurchases: CVX mentions the excise tax is included in capital in excess of par value, but does not specify a dollar amount, indicating a less explicit treatment.",
        "Hop 3: LOW \u2192 Excise Tax on Share Repurchases: LOW states that the 1% excise tax is recognized as part of the cost basis of shares acquired, consistent with the Inflation Reduction Act."

Morgan Stanley reports miscellaneous revenues within its 'Other' revenues, which include realized gains and losses on AFS securities, referral fees, and other ancillary income streams. Target discloses miscellaneous revenues under its 'Other' category, which includes commissions from third-party sales, Shipt membership fees, rental income, and Target Circle 360 membership revenue.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n\n## 1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\ncost  basis  of  the  property,  equipment  and  leasehold  improvements  was  $7.7  billion  and  $7.3  billion  at  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  respectively.  Accumulated depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements was $5.1 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Related depreciation and amortization expense was $469 million, $470 million and $423 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company, as lessee, has entered into various lease and sublease agreements for office space and equipment. At contract inception, the Company determines that an arrangement contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For contracts that contain a lease, the Company recognizes the ROU asset in other assets and the lease liability in other liabilities. The Company evaluates whether a ROU asset is impaired when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the associated lease costs are recorded as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are determined using the Company's incremental borrowing rate based upon information available at commencement date to recognize the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include lease payments and excludes lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease and are included in the lease measurement when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\n\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components and accounts for these items as a single lease component for all asset classes.\n\nThe majority of the Company's leases and subleases are operating leases related to office space. The Company recognizes lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Other Revenues\n\nOther revenues primarily include fees related to service contracts from customers for vision fee for service arrangements, prepaid legal plans, fee-based investment management, recordkeeping and administrative services, and administrative services-only ('ASO') contracts.  Substantially all of the revenue from the services is recognized over time as the applicable services are provided or are made available to the customers. The revenue recognized includes variable consideration to the extent  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  will  not  occur.  In  addition  to  the  service  fees,  other  revenues  also  include  certain  stable  value  fees  and  other miscellaneous revenues. These fees and miscellaneous revenues are recognized as earned.\n\n## Policyholder Dividends\n\nPolicyholder dividends are approved annually by the insurance subsidiaries' boards of directors. The aggregate amount of policyholder dividends is related to actual interest, mortality, morbidity and ex pense ex perience for the year, as well as management's judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be retained by the insurance subsidiaries.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as investments accounted for under the equity method, are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. The determination of the functional currency is made based on the appropriate economic and management indicators. For most of the Company's foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency. For certain other foreign operations, such as Japan, the local currency and one or more other currencies qualify as functional currencies. Assets and liabilities of foreign affiliates and subsidiaries are translated from the functional currency to U.S. dollars at the  ex change  rates  in  effect  at  each  year-end  and  revenues  and  ex penses  are  translated  at  the  average  ex change  rates  during  the  year.  The  resulting  translation adjustments are charged or credited directly to OCI, net of applicable taxes. G ains and losses from foreign currency transactions, including the effect of re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities to the appropriate functional currency, are reported as part of net investment gains (losses) in the period in which they occur.",

Estimates of the fair value of the investments that produce these revenues may  involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic  and  financial conditions, generally or in relation to specific transactions.\n\nWithin the Institutional Securities segment, gains and losses are primarily from business-related investments. Certain investments are subject to sale restrictions.\n\nWithin the Investment Management business segment, Investments revenues are  primarily  from  performance-based  fees  in  the  form  of  carried  interest,  a portion of which is subject to reversal, and gains and losses from investments. The business is entitled to receive carried interest when the return in certain funds  exceeds  specified  performance  targets.  Additionally,  we  consolidate certain sponsored Investment Management  funds  where revenues are primarily attributable to holders of noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Commissions and Fees\n\nCommissions and fees result from arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for ex ecuting transactions related to securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of other products.\n\nWithin the Institutional  Securities business segment, commissions and fees include  fees  earned  from  market-making  activities,  such  as  ex ecuting  and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC derivatives.\n\nWithin  the  Wealth  Management  business  segment,  commissions  and  fees arise from client transactions including in equity securities, insurance products, mutual funds, alternative investments, futures and options. Wealth Management  also  earns  revenues  from  order  flow  payments for  directing customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges and market centers for execution.\n\n## Asset Management\n\nAsset  management  revenues  include  fees  associated  with  the  management and supervision of assets and the distribution of funds and similar products.\n\nWithin  the  Wealth  Management  business  segment,  Asset  management revenues are related to advisory services associated with fee-based assets, account service and administration, as well as distribution of products.  These revenues are generally based on the net asset value of the account in which a client is invested.\n\nWithin  the  Investment  Management  business  segment, Asset  management revenues are primarily composed of fees received from investment vehicles on the  basis  of  assets  under  management.  Performance-based  fees,  not  in  the form  of  carried  interest,  are  earned  on  certain  products  and  separately managed accounts as a percentage  of  appreciation  in  value  and,  in  certain cases,  are  based  upon  the  achievement  of  performance  criteria.  These performance fees are generally recognized on a quarterly or annual basis.\n\n## Net Interest\n\nInterest income and Interest expense are functions of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities, Investment securities, Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell,  Securities  loaned  or  sold  under  agreements  to  repurchase,  Loans, Deposits and Borrowings.\n\nWithin the Institutional Securities business segment, Net interest is a function of  market-making  strategies,  client  activity,  and  the  prevailing  level,  term structure and volatility of interest rates.  Net interest is impacted by marketmaking,  lending  and  financing  activities  as  we  generally  earn  interest  on securities held by the Firm, Securities borrowed, Securities purchased under agreements  to  resell,  Loans  and  margin  loans,  while  Borrowings,  Securities loaned  and  Securities  sold  under  agreements  to  repurchase  generally  incur interest ex pense.\n\nWithin the Wealth Management business segment, Interest income is driven by  assets  held  including  Investment  securities,  Loans  and  margin  loans. Interest ex pense is driven by Deposits and other funding.\n\n## Other\n\nOther revenues for Institutional Securities include revenues and losses from equity method investments, fees earned in association with lending activities, mark-to-market gains and losses on loans and lending commitments held for sale, as well as gains and losses on economic derivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment loans and lending commitments.\n\nOther revenues for Wealth Management include realized gains and losses on AFS securities, account handling fees, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues.\n\n## Provision for Credit Losses\n\nThe  Provision  for  credit  losses  includes  the  provision  for  credit  losses  for loans and lending commitments held for investment.",

          "chunk_text": "Pension and other postretirement plans - The Company recognizes the funded status of its single-employer defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans as assets or liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at December 31, the measurement date. Overfunded plans, if any, are aggregated and recorded in other assets, while underfunded plans are aggregated and recorded as accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nNet periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost/(income), excluding the service cost component, is recognized in other income (expense),  net  on  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  These  costs  include  interest  cost,  expected  return  on  plan  assets, amortization  of  prior  service  costs  or  credits  and  gains  or  losses  previously  recognized  as  a  component  of  accumulated  other comprehensive  income  (loss).  The  service  cost  component  is  recognized  in  general  and  administrative  expenses  on  the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nDefined contribution plans - The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are recorded as employees render service to the Company. The charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nAdvertising and marketing - Expenses incurred to promote Mastercard's brand, products and services are recognized in advertising and marketing on the consolidated statement of operations. The timing of recognition is dependent on the type of advertising or marketing expense.\n\nForeign currency remeasurement and translation -  Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  are  remeasured  to  functional  currencies  using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are remeasured at the weighted-average exchange rate for the period. Resulting exchange gains and losses related to remeasurement are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nWhere  a  non-U.S.  currency  is  the  functional  currency,  translation  from  that  functional  currency  to  U.S.  dollars  is  performed  for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using  a  weighted-average  exchange  rate  for  the  period.  Resulting  translation  adjustments  are  reported  as  a  component  of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nTreasury stock - The Company records the repurchase of shares of its common stock at cost on the trade date of the transaction. These shares are considered treasury stock, which is a reduction to stockholders' equity. Treasury stock is included in authorized and issued shares but excluded from outstanding shares.\n\nShare-based payments -  The Company measures share-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and uses the straight-line method of attribution, net of estimated forfeitures, for expensing awards over the requisite employee service period. The Company estimates the fair value of its non-qualified stock option awards ('Options') using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units ('RSUs') is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the Company's stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents. The Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used to determine  the  grant  date  fair  value  of  performance  stock  units  ('PSUs')  granted.  All  share-based  compensation  expenses  are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nRedeemable  non-controlling  interests -  The  Company's  business  combinations  may  include  provisions  allowing  non-controlling equity owners the ability to require the Company to purchase additional interests in the subsidiary at their discretion. The interests are initially recorded at fair value and in subsequent reporting periods are accreted or adjusted to the estimated redemption value. The adjustments to the redemption value are recorded to retained earnings or additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.  The  redeemable  non-controlling  interests  are  considered  temporary  and  reported  outside  of  permanent  equity  on  the consolidated balance sheet at the greater of the carrying amount adjusted for the non-controlling interest's share of net income (loss) or its redemption value.\n\nEarnings per share -  The  Company calculates basic earnings per share ('EPS') by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock units using the treasury stock method. The Company may be required to calculate EPS using the two-class method as a result of its redeemable non-controlling interests. If redemption value exceeds the fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests, the excess would be a reduction to net income for the EPS calculation.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Plan Assets\n\nCertain  U.S.  subsidiaries  provide  employees  with  benefits  under  various  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  of 1974  ('ERISA')  benefit  plans.  These  include  qualified  pension  plans,  postretirement  medical  plans  and  certain  retiree  life insurance coverage. The assets of these U.S. subsidiaries' qualified pension plans are held in an insurance group annuity contract, and the vast majority of the assets of the postretirement medical plan are held in a trust which largely utilizes insurance contracts to hold the assets. All of these contracts are issued by the Company's insurance affiliates, and the assets under the contracts are held in insurance separate accounts that have been established by the Company. The underlying assets of the separate accounts are principally  comprised  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments,  fixed  maturity  securities  AFS,  equity  securities, derivatives, real estate and private equity investments. The assets backing the retiree life coverage also utilize insurance contracts issued by the Company's insurance affiliate and are held in a general account Life Insurance Funding Agreement.\n\nThe  insurance  contract  provider  engages  investment  management  firms  ('Managers')  to  serve  as  sub-advisors  for  the separate  accounts  based  on  the  specific  investment  needs  and  requests  identified  by  the  plan  fiduciary.  These  Managers  have portfolio  management  discretion  over  the  purchasing  and  selling  of  securities  and  other  investment  assets  pursuant  to  the respective investment management agreements and guidelines established for each insurance separate account. The assets of the qualified  pension  plans  and  postretirement  medical  plans  (the  'Invested  Plans')  are  well  diversified  across  multiple  asset categories and across a number of different Managers, with the intent of minimizing risk concentrations within any given asset category or with any of the given Managers.\n\nThe  Invested  Plans,  other  than  those  held  in  participant  directed  investment  accounts,  are  managed  in  accordance  with investment  policies  consistent  with  the  longer-term  nature  of  related  benefit  obligations  and  within  prudent  risk  parameters. Specifically,  investment  policies  are  oriented  toward  (i)  maximizing  the  Invested  Plan's  funded  status;  (ii)  minimizing  the volatility of the Invested Plan's funded status; (iii) generating asset returns that exceed liability increases; and (iv) targeting rates of  return  in  excess  of  a  custom  benchmark  and  industry  standards  over  appropriate  reference  time  periods.  These  goals  are expected to be met through identifying appropriate and diversified asset classes and allocations, ensuring adequate liquidity to pay benefits and expenses when due and controlling the costs of administering and managing the Invested Plan's investments. Independent investment consultants are periodically used to evaluate the investment risk of the Invested Plan's assets relative to liabilities,  analyze  the  economic  and  portfolio  impact  of  various  asset  allocations  and  management  strategies  and  recommend asset allocations.\n\nDerivative contracts may be used to reduce investment risk, to manage duration and to replicate the risk/return profile of an asset or asset class. Derivatives may not be used to leverage a portfolio in any manner, such as to magnify exposure to an asset, asset class, interest rates or any other financial variable. Derivatives are also prohibited for use in creating exposures to securities, currencies, indices or any other financial variable that is otherwise restricted.",

TXN discloses specific ongoing costs related to the Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility purchase and pre-production operations, which are expected to continue until early 2023.

Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may depend on vendors to create mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers and end users, to  deploy  our  mitigations  alone  or  as  part  of  their  own  mitigations,  and  they  may  delay, decline  or  modify  the  implementation  of  such  mitigations.  Our  relationships  with  our  customers  could  be  adversely affected  as  some  of  our  customers  may  stop  purchasing  our  products,  reduce  or  delay  future  purchases  of  our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We have and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation related to security vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or financial results.\n\n## IT  outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive  information,  be  costly  to  remediate  or  cause  significant  damage  to  our  business,  reputation  and operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets, and also may  maintain  sensitive  information  on  our  business  partners'  and  third-party  providers'  IT  assets,  including  our intellectual  property  and  proprietary  or  confidential  business  information  relating  to  our  business  and  that  of  our customers and business partners. The White House, SEC and other regulators have also increased their focus on companies'  cybersecurity  vulnerabilities  and  risks.  Maintaining  the  security  of  this  information  is  important  to  our business  and  reputation.  We  believe  that  companies  like AMD  have  been  increasingly  subject  to  a  wide  variety  of security  incidents,  cyber-attacks,  hacking  and  phishing  attacks,  business  and  system  disruption  attacks,  and  other attempts to gain unauthorized access. The increased prevalence of work-from-home arrangements at AMD and our providers  has  presented  additional  operational  and  cybersecurity  risks  to  our  IT  systems  as  well  as  those  of  our customers, business partners, and third-party partners. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they  may  be  custom-crafted  against  our  information  systems.  Cyber  threats  may  come  into  our  network  through malicious code that is added to widely available open-source software. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, have been and may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.\n\nIt is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. It also may not be possible to determine the root cause of such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks on us or our customers, business partners or third-party providers could also  cause  us  to  incur  significant  remediation  costs,  result  in  product  development  delays,  disrupt  key  business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.\n\nWe  also  maintain  confidential  and  personally  identifiable  information  about  our  workers  and  consumers.  The confidentiality  and  integrity  of  our  worker  and  consumer  data  is  important  to  our  business  and  our  workers  and consumers  have  a  high  expectation  that  we  adequately  protect  their  personal  information.  In  addition,  many governments  have  enacted  laws  around  personally  identifiable  information,  such  as  the  European  Union's  General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments.\n\nWe  anticipate  ongoing  and  increasing  costs  related  to:  enhancing  and  implementing  information  security  controls, including  costs  related  to  upgrading  application,  computer,  and  network  security  components;  training  workers  to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.",

          "chunk_text": "on a different timeline than expected. If we are unable to complete any of the separations, we will have incurred costs without realizing the benefits of such transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies. And, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the Company's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect to incur non-U.S. cash taxes on the preparatory restructuring and may also incur non-cash tax expense including potential impairments of deferred tax assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will qualify as taxfree for U.S. purposes. If the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we would incur a significant tax liability, while the distributions to the Company's shareholders would become taxable and the new independent companies might incur income tax liabilities as well. Furthermore, if the separation transactions are completed, we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful.\n\nWhether or not the separation transactions are completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of the Company; appropriately allocating assets and liabilities among the three companies, particularly given the staggered nature of the separation transactions; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing or attracting new business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties; assigning customer contracts and intellectual property to each of the businesses; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets. In particular, GE for the past several years has been undertaking various restructuring and business transformation actions (including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives) that have entailed changes across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. This poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial targets, loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation, and these risks are heightened with the additional interdependent actions that will be needed to complete the planned separation transactions. Moreover, completion of the separation transactions will result in the three independent public companies that are smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than GE is today. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company's results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Each of the separate companies will also incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. If the separation transactions are completed, investors holding our common stock may sell the common stock of any of the new independent companies that do not match their investment strategies, which may cause a decline in the market price of such common stock.\n\nCOVID-19 - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. Our operations and financial performance since early 2020 have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused, and may continue to cause, a slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect economic activity globally or in various regions, the extent to which this will adversely impact our future operations and financial performance is uncertain. Across all of our businesses, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, site shutdowns, workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at those of our customers and suppliers, global supply chain disruptions and price inflation. We also have experienced, and may continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for products and services, customer requests for potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications, supply chain under-liquidation, delays of deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones, delays or cancellations of new projects and related down payments and other factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on our customers that adversely impact our businesses. In particular, interruptions of regional and international air travel from COVID-19 are having a material adverse effect on our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our services and products. While our Aviation business is showing continued signs of recovery, the recently renewed intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic in many parts of the world could stall the recovery achieved to date and lead to future requests for payment deferrals, contract modifications, and similar actions across the aviation sector, which may lead to additional charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts, or to customer disputes.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the impact of coronavirus variants and resurgences; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and workforce pressures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines; our employees' compliance with vaccine mandates that may apply in various jurisdictions; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace and extent of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A number of accounting estimates that we make have been and will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties related to these and other factors, and our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 (see Note 1). As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described below.",

      "question": "How do Boeing, Booking Holdings, and Nike compare in their gross increases from current period tax positions, and what might these differences suggest about their respective tax planning activities and operational strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "Boeing reported gross increases from current period tax positions of $181 million in 2023, indicating significant new uncertain tax positions likely tied to complex aerospace contracts and R&D credits. Booking Holdings reported a much lower figure of $16 million in 2023, suggesting more stable or conservative tax planning, possibly due to the maturity of its digital business model. Nike reported $77 million in gross increases for the same period, reflecting a moderate level of new tax positions, potentially related to its global supply chain and brand licensing activities. These differences suggest varying approaches to tax strategy: Boeing appears more aggressive or complex in its tax planning, Booking Holdings maintains a more restrained posture, and Nike balances growth-related tax initiatives with risk management. The disparity in scale and trend of these increases provides insight into how each company navigates tax uncertainties within its industry context.",

Charles Schwab (SCHW) spent $1,254 million on Occupancy and Equipment, which made up roughly 10.1% of its total expenses excluding interest ($12,459 million).

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## BROADCOM INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. Overview and Basis of Presentation\n\n## Overview\n\nBroadcom Inc. ('Broadcom'), a Delaware corporation, is a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile and cloud platforms. Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex hybrid environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security. We also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Broadcom,' 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52-week year and the first Sunday in November in a 53-week year. Our fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 ('fiscal year 2022') was a 52week fiscal year. The first quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended on January 30, 2022, the second quarter ended on May 1, 2022 and the third quarter ended on July 31, 2022. Our fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 ('fiscal year 2021') and fiscal year ended November 1, 2020 ('fiscal year 2020') were both 52-week fiscal years.\n\nOn November 4, 2019, we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security business (the 'Symantec Business'). We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. See Note 13. 'Segment Information' for additional information.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP'). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nForeign currency remeasurement. We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. Foreign currency assets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured and recorded at historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.\n\nUse of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The inputs into certain of these estimates and assumptions include the consideration of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of these estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods.\n\nCash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investment securities with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We determine the appropriate classification of our cash and cash equivalents at the time of purchase.\n\nTrade accounts receivable, net. Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information, among other factors. Allowances for doubtful accounts were not material as of October 30, 2022 or October 31, 2021. Accounts receivable are also recognized net of sales returns and distributor credit allowances. These amounts are recognized when it is both probable and estimable that discounts will be granted or products will be returned. Allowances for sales returns and distributor credit allowances as of October 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021 were $126 million and $129 million, respectively.",

For these purposes, forward-looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future and may relate to such matters as net sales growth, changes in comparable sales, cannibalization of existing locations by new openings,  price  or  fee  changes,  earnings  performance,  earnings  per  share,  stock-based  compensation  expense, warehouse  openings  and  closures,  capital  spending,  the  effect  of  adopting  certain  accounting  standards,  future financial  reporting,  financing,  margins,  return  on  invested  capital,  strategic  direction,  expense  controls,  membership renewal rates, shopping frequency, litigation, and the demand for our products and services. In some cases, forwardlooking  statements can be identified because they contain words such as 'anticipate,' 'believe,' 'continue,' 'could,' 'estimate,'  'expect,'  'intend,'  'likely,'  'may,'  'might,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'predict,'  'project,'  'seek,'  'should,'  'target,' 'will,' 'would,' or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  that  may  cause  actual  events,  results,  or  performance  to  differ  materially  from  those  indicated  by such statements, including, without limitation, the factors set forth in the section titled 'Item 1A-Risk Factors', and other factors noted in the section titled 'Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1-Business\n\nCostco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  (Costco  or  the  Company)  began  operations  in  1983,  in  Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto  Rico,  Canada,  Mexico,  Japan,  United  Kingdom  (U.K.),  Korea,  Taiwan, Australia,  Spain,  France,  China,  and Iceland.  Costco  operated  838,  815,  and  795  warehouses  worldwide  at  August  28,  2022,  August  29,  2021,  and August 30, 2020, respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan,  Japan,  and Australia.  Our  common  stock  trades  on  the  NASDAQ  Global  Select  Market,  under  the  symbol 'COST.'\n\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively.\n\n## General\n\nWe operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-service  warehouse  facilities, these  volumes  and  turnover  enable  us  to  operate  profitably  at  significantly  lower  gross  margins  (net  sales  less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.\n\nWe  buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  cross-docking  consolidation  points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional  multiple-step  distribution  channels.  For  our  e-commerce  operations  we  ship  merchandise  through  our depots, our logistics operations for big and bulky items, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers.",

      "question": "How do HON, PFE, and TXN each treat the amortization of prior service cost in their postretirement benefit disclosures, and what does this reveal about their respective pension and postretirement obligation strategies?",
      "answer": "HON reports a consistent amortization of prior service cost as a credit, with values of $74M, $66M, and $62M in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively, indicating a steady reduction in prior service obligations. PFE shows a much smaller amortization of prior service cost, at $2M, $3M, and $4M over the same period, suggesting limited prior service adjustments in their pension plans, but a significant $151M to $173M amortization credit in postretirement plans, indicating a more aggressive recognition of prior service credits in health benefits. TXN, in contrast, reports no amortization of prior service cost in its U.S. defined benefit plans but shows a minor $2M to $1M credit in its U.S. retiree health care plans and a $1M credit in non-U.S. defined benefit plans, reflecting minimal prior service adjustments across its benefit programs. The differences in amortization approaches suggest varying strategies in managing legacy benefit obligations, with HON showing the most significant ongoing credit, PFE focusing on postretirement health plans, and TXN maintaining minimal adjustments.",

      "answer": "AT&T highlights that rising medical costs, driven in part by inflation, could materially increase its benefit plan costs and future funding requirements, with these costs being reflected in its financial statements. UnitedHealth Group notes that large-scale public health crises and unfavorable economic conditions could lead to increased medical care costs and reduced premium sufficiency, directly impacting its financial performance. UPS states that its health and welfare insurance plan liabilities depend heavily on estimates tied to global health events and medical cost inflation trends, with actual outcomes potentially differing materially from projections. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to medical cost inflation, they experience it through different lenses: AT&T through long-term benefit obligations, UNH through health services delivery and premium risk, and UPS through self-insured health liability estimation.",

The majority of the development activities are performed to create new services and to invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers. Research and development expenses were $955 in 2024, $954 in 2023, and $1,236 in 2022.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nNumber of Employees As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 140,990 persons.\n\nEmployee Development We believe our success depends on our employees' success and that all employees must have the skills they need to thrive. We offer training and elective courses that give employees the opportunity to enhance their skills. We also intend to help cultivate the next generation of talent that will lead our company into the future by providing employees with educational opportunities through our internal training organization.\n\nLabor Contracts Approximately 43% of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) or other unions. After expiration of collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached. The main contract set to expire in 2025 covers approximately 9,000 employees in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas and is set to expire in April.\n\nCompensation and Benefits In addition to salaries, we provide a variety of benefit programs to help meet the needs of our employees. These programs cover active and former employees and may vary by subsidiary and region. These programs include 401(k) plans, pension benefits, and health and welfare benefits, among many others. In addition to our active employee base, at December 31, 2024, we had approximately 496,000 retirees and dependents who were eligible to receive retiree benefits.\n\nWe review our benefit plans to maintain competitive packages that reflect the needs of our workforce. We also adapt our compensation model to provide fair and inclusive pay practices across our business. We are committed to pay equity for employees who hold the same jobs, work in the same geographic area, and have the same levels of experience and performance.\n\nEmployee Wellness We provide our employees access to flexible and convenient health and welfare programs and workplace accommodations. We have prioritized self-care and emphasized a focus on wellness and providing flexible scheduling or time-off options.\n\nInclusion We believe that championing inclusion does more than just make us a better company, it contributes to a world where people are empowered to be their very best and it leads to a workforce that is representative of, and responsive to, the broad customer base that we serve. That is why we are committed to inclusion and one of the reasons why our company purpose is 'to connect people to greater possibilities.' This emanates from our unwavering pledge to ensure that employees feel included when they join AT&amp;T, and are provided with opportunities for advancement, training and development to realize their full potential while working for the company.\n\nWe believe in attracting and hiring talented people who represent a mix of backgrounds and experiences. At AT&amp;T, we have employee groups that reflect our large and varied workforce. These affinity groups provide opportunities for professional enrichment, leadership, community engagement, market development and networking. It is important that our employees feel they are included, valued, and are fully engaged in our success.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this document, including the matters contained under the heading 'Cautionary Language Concerning ForwardLooking Statements,' you should carefully read the matters described below. We believe that each of these matters could materially affect our business. Most, if not all, of these factors are beyond our ability to control.\n\n## Macro-Economic Factors:\n\nAdverse changes in the U.S. securities markets, increasing interest rates, rising inflation and medical costs could materially increase our benefit plan costs and future funding requirements.\n\nOur costs to provide current benefits and funding for future benefits are subject to increases, primarily due to continuing increases in medical and prescription drug costs, in part due to inflation, and can be affected by lower returns on assets held by our pension and other benefit plans, which are reflected in our financial statements for that year. In calculating the recognized benefit costs, we have made certain assumptions regarding future investment returns, interest rates and medical costs. These",

For example, disruptions in public and private infrastructure resulting from such events could increase our operating costs and impair our ability to provide services to our clients and customers. In addition, as a result of these events, the premiums and fees we charge may not be sufficient to cover our medical and administrative costs, deferred medical care could be sought in future periods at potentially higher acuity levels, we could experience reduced demand for our services, and our clinical and non-clinical workforce could be affected and sustain a reduced capacity to handle demand for care. Public health crises arising from natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, and snowstorms, or effects of climate change could impact our business operations and result in increased medical care costs. Government enactment of emergency powers in response to public health crises could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting availability of, or our ability to deliver, pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items.\n\n## Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants.\n\nOur products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete. Our sales could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be impaired by changes in our business practices and the terms of our relationships, including commission levels.\n\n## Our businesses are subject to risks associated with unfavorable economic conditions.\n\nUnfavorable economic conditions may have a range of impacts on the demand for our products and services. Such conditions also have caused and in future periods could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer particular coverage on a voluntary, employeefunded basis to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in people served and in the premium and fee revenues we generate.\n\nA prolonged unfavorable economic environment could constrain state and federal budgets and result in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nA prolonged unfavorable economic environment could also adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could negatively affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results by impacting the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others.\n\n## Our failure to attract, dev elop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future performance.\n\nWe depend on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and executives, including those with diverse talents, backgrounds, experiences and perspectives, to operate and expand our business. While we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee that the services of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives, our business, results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected. Experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is competitive. We may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business. Adverse changes to our corporate culture could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and executives.",

All these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.\n\nDue to the complexity and inherent uncertainty associated with the estimation of our workers' compensation, automobile and general claims liabilities, the thirdparty actuary develops a range of expected losses. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate; however, actual experience in claims frequency and/or severity of claims could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations.\n\nWe also sponsor several health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. Liabilities and expenses related to these plans are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, global health events, anticipated utilization by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. We believe our estimates are reasonable and appropriate. Actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.\n\nSelf-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How do ABBV, NVDA, and T differ in their treatment of unremitted foreign earnings and related tax implications, particularly in terms of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances?",
      "answer": "ABBV recorded valuation allowances of $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, primarily related to foreign and state net operating losses and credit carryforwards not expected to be realized, and noted that unremitted foreign earnings subject to the Act's transition tax are not considered indefinitely reinvested. NVDA reported deferred tax liabilities of $150 million related to unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of January 30, 2022, indicating a $39 million increase year-over-year. T stated that post-1986 unremitted foreign earnings subjected to the one-time transition tax are not indefinitely reinvested and can be repatriated without significant incremental tax costs, while other foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Collectively, the companies reflect varying degrees of reinvestment assumptions and deferred tax liabilities tied to unremitted foreign earnings, with ABBV having the most significant valuation allowance, NVDA showing a growing liability, and T distinguishing between categories of foreign earnings.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe decrease in net deferred tax assets is primarily related to the utilization of net operating losses and other carryforwards offset by an increase in advance payments. The decrease in deferred tax liabilities is primarily related to amortization of intangible assets.\n\nIn connection with the Allergan acquisition, the company recorded adjustments within the measurement period in 2021 related to foreign net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The adjustments reflected an increase of $8.2 billion to deferred tax assets and an offsetting increase to valuation allowances, resulting in no net impact to deferred tax assets.\n\nThe company had valuation allowances of $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. These were principally related to foreign and state net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the company had U.S. federal and state credit carryforwards of $214 million as well as U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $34.4 billion, which will expire at various times through 2041. The remaining U.S. federal and foreign loss carryforwards of $3.2 billion have no expiration.\n\nThe Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign earnings subject to the Act's transition tax are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings or eligible for the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. However, the company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n",

SO, though not explicitly mentioning deferred tax charges, shows deferred charges related to income taxes at $240 million in 2021 and $235 million in 2020, indicating a more stable tax-related deferred liability position. These differences suggest that AIG experiences volatility in deferred tax impacts, PM manages a complex structure involving intercompany tax liabilities and asset carryforwards, and SO maintains a more consistent deferred tax posture.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reports that all of its $45 million in total fair value assets as of December 31, 22021, are categorized under Level 2, including $11 million in debt securities and $18 million in equity securities, indicating a full reliance on Level 2 valuation methods for its disclosed fair value assets. Starbucks (SBUX) explains that Level 2 fair value measurements are used for long-term debt and certain assets when quoted prices are unavailable, relying on market data such as interest rate curves and forward prices, and also discloses $75.6 million in cash collateral pledged under Level 2 commodity derivative margin requirements as of October 2, 2022. AT&T (T) notes that its notes and debentures are valued using Level 2 inputs, including quoted prices for identical or similar securities in active and inactive markets, showing a similar dependence on market-based models for its long-term debt instruments. Together, these disclosures reveal that all three companies apply Level 2 fair value measurements, but with differing asset and liability categories and varying degrees of detail in their valuation methodologies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nevent indicates impairment may be present. Any adjustments as a result of price changes or impairments are recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following:\n\nLevel 1: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For equity and U.S. government treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value.\n\nLevel 2: When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of certain assets based upon factors such as the quoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.\n\nLevel 3: We determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally-developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads and effective maturity.\n\nAssets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWe manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, assets and liabilities and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nWe record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, cash collateral held under collateral security arrangements was $74.3 million and $44.7 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 2, 2022, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $75.6 million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 3, 2021, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $72.5 million and is included in cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nBy using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ('OCI') and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings.",

Altria incurred acquisition-related costs in 2024 primarily tied to patent infringement lawsuits associated with the NJOY Transaction.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nOn September 30, 2023 (the 'Distribution Date'), the Company completed the separation (the 'Separation') of its former Env ironmental &amp; Applied Solutions business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Veralto Corporation ('Veralto'), the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Veralto common stock for ev ery three shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of September 13, 2023, the record date for the distribution. Fractional shares of Veralto common stock that otherwise would hav e been distributed were aggregated and sold into the public market and the proceeds distributed to Danaher stockholders who otherwise would hav e receiv ed fractional shares of Veralto common stock.\n\nIn preparation for the Separation, in September 2023 Veralto issued approximately $2.6 billion in debt securities (refer to Note 13). The proceeds from these issuances were used to fund the approximately $2.6 billion net cash distributions Veralto made to Danaher prior to the Distribution Date ('Veralto Distribution'). Danaher used the Veralto Distribution proceeds to redeem approximately $1.0 billion of commercial paper, to satisfy bond maturities and to fund certain of the Company's regular, quarterly cash div idends to shareholders.\n\nThe accounting requirements for reporting Veralto as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed. Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation. The Company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business' net assets to the Company's consolidated net assets.\n\nAs a result of the Separation, the Company incurred $145 million and $9 million in Separation-related costs during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely, which are reflected in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and activ ities within finance, tax, legal and information technology functions as well as certain inv estment banking fees and tax costs incurred upon the Separation.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, Danaher and Veralto entered into v arious agreements to effect the Separation and prov ide a framework for their relationship after the Separation, including a separation and distribution agreement, transition serv ices agreement, an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement and a Danaher Business System ('DBS') license agreement. These agreements prov ide for the allocation between Danaher and Veralto of assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including inv estments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after Veralto's separation from Danaher and gov ern certain relationships between Danaher and Veralto after the Separation. In addition, Danaher is also party to v arious commercial agreements with Veralto entities. The amounts paid and receiv ed by Danaher for transition serv ices prov ided under the abov e agreements as well as sales and purchases to and from Veralto were not material to the Company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe key components of income from the Veralto business from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31 were as follows ($ in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "CVX emphasizes a structured approach to talent acquisition and retention, noting a voluntary attrition rate of 3.1% in 2024, which it attributes to competitive pay, benefits, and development programs such as tailored generative AI training and the Digital Scholar Program. DIS indirectly highlights the pressure of rising hiring costs through its discussion of increased compliance and investment needs related to human capital management, particularly under evolving ESG reporting obligations. TXN explicitly states that competition for skilled personnel is intense and expresses concern over the risks associated with its ability to retain and recruit qualified employees, especially in a competitive environment. Together, these perspectives reveal that while CVX is proactively investing in workforce development to mitigate hiring cost pressures, DIS is grappling with external regulatory-driven increases in human capital costs, and TXN is facing direct challenges in attracting and retaining technical talent due to market competition.",

The reports are also available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\n\n## Human Capital Management\n\nThe  Chevron  Way  explains  the  company's  beliefs,  vision,  purpose  and  values.  It  guides  how  the  company's  employees  work  and  establishes  a  common understanding of culture and aspirations.\n\nChevron leadership is accountable for investing in the company's people and culture with the objective of engaging employees to develop their full potential to help deliver energy solutions and enable human progress. This includes reviews of metrics addressing critical function hiring, leadership development, retention, diversity and inclusion, and employee engagement.\n\nThe following table summarizes the number of Chevron employees by sex, where data is available, and by region as of December 31, 2024.\n\n* Includes em ployees where data was not collected or em ployee chose not to disclose.\n\n## Hiring, Development and Retention\n\nThe company's approach to attracting, developing and retaining a global, diverse workforce of high-performing talent is anchored by an environment of personal growth and engagement. The company's philosophy is to offer compelling career opportunities and a competitive total compensation and benefits package linked to individual and enterprise performance. The company recruits new employees in a variety of ways, including through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to provide specialized skills.\n\nChevron's learning and development programs are designed to help employees build technical, operating and leadership capabilities. The company's leadership reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are refined on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of the business. The company invests in developing leadership at every level, including coaching programs for frontline supervisors, managers and individual contributors. Chevron invests in developing and upskilling employees, including things such as tailored generative AI training for leaders, practitioners and the broader workforce. In addition, the company offers  the  Digital  Scholar  Program,  preparing  employees  with  advanced  technology  skills  through  one-year  Master  of  Science  degrees  in  Engineering  and Management.\n\nIn addition, leadership reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for key positions. The Board of Directors provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning.\n\nManagement routinely reviews the retention of its professional population, executives, all levels of management, and the majority of its regular employee population. The voluntary attrition for this population in 2024 was 3.1 percent, in line with historical rates. The voluntary attrition rate generally ex cludes employee departures under restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the company's commitment to employee development, competitive pay and benefits, and culture.",

For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to environmental, social and governance matters, including environmental sustainability, climate change, human rights and human capital management, have been adopted or are under consideration, some of which include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response has increased our compliance costs, including from increased investment in technology and appropriate expertise and required the implementation of new reporting processes, entailing additional compliance risk.\n\nIn addition, we have undertaken or announced a number of related actions and goals, which will require changes to operations and ongoing investment. There is no assurance that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes or that we will achieve any of these goals. Consumer, government and other stakeholder perceptions of our initiatives often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain environmental sustainability goals or initiatives will depend in part on third-party collaboration, the availability of suppliers that can satisfy new requirements, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## We face risks related to damage to our reputation or brands.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, some types of damage to our reputation or brands have an impact on all of our businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, some types of brand damage are not locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors, including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture, which may be amplified by social media, adversely impact our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC streaming services.\n\nThe success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC streaming services will be impacted by the success of the reorganization of our media and entertainment business and the strategic change in our approach to content curation initiated in fiscal 2023; our ability to drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn, achieve the desired financial impact of our DTC pricing, bundling and distribution determinations, the Disney+ ad supported service, monetization and cost containment strategy and the launch of the ESPN flagship DTC service; and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the business of initial exploitation, and amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights are generally allocated across businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business, including the applicable DTC service. There are a number of competing DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by challenging economic conditions, such as during periods of high inflation or declines in economic activity. In addition, such economic conditions negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and sports and other programming rights and are sometimes not successful in recruiting and retaining talent and obtaining desired programming rights and face increased costs to do so. We have experienced flat subscriber growth or net losses of subscribers in periods. Our content does not always successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations as well as government-imposed content restrictions, impacts the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or lead to higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC streaming services.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or v olatility in the U .S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. Our elevated indebtedness and leverage ratios in response to the financial impact of COVID-19 on our",

Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully dev elop, manufacture and market innov ativ e products in a timely and costeffectiv e manner. We make significant inv estments in research and dev elopment to improv e existing technology and products, dev elop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. In some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our inv estments because they are generally made before commercial v iability can be assured. Further, projects that are commercially v iable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed.\n\n## We face supply chain and manufacturing risks.\n\nWe rely on third parties to supply us with goods and serv ices in a cost-effectiv e and timely manner. Our access to needed goods and serv ices may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our own or suppliers' operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; cybersecurity incidents; ability to access conflict-free minerals; natural ev ents or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, serv ices and utilities. Additionally, a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers' information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. If our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receiv able or access needed technology.\n\nIn particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment, and those of our suppliers, require that certain key materials, serv ices and utilities be av ailable. Suppliers of these items hav e and might continue to extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to factors beyond our control. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, serv ices and utilities could adv ersely affect our results of operations.\n\nOur inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies, install manufacturing equipment or secure necessary personnel for manufacturing operations could adv ersely affect our results of operations. We hav e made and will continue to make significant inv estments in manufacturing capacity, and we might not realize our expected return on those inv estments. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties (including contractors and other serv ice prov iders) to support key portions of our operations (including manufacturing operations and adv anced logic manufacturing process technology dev elopment) and to construct our facilities. We do not hav e long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. Reliance on these suppliers inv olv es risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers' inability to dev elop and deliv er adv anced logic manufacturing process technology or build facilities in a timely, cost-effectiv e, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers' imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property. In addition, failure by these suppliers to fulfill expectations, commitments and responsibilities in accordance with agreed terms or applicable laws, rules and regulations (including health, safety, forced labor, human trafficking and supply chain standards) could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\n\n## Our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain, train and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitiv e env ironment.\n\nOur continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel as well as the contributions and effectiv e succession of senior management and other key employees. Skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, sales, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain, train and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. Our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to v arious locations may be limited by immigration laws and policies, including changes to, or the administration or interpretation of, those laws and policies. Failure to retain, train and recruit key personnel could disrupt our business and adv ersely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.",

      "question": "How do AIG, CVS, and MetLife each account for unearned premiums in their financial reporting, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to recognizing revenue from insurance contracts?",
      "answer": "AIG accounts for unearned premiums as part of 'Other policyholder funds,' particularly in relation to experience adjustments for contracts such as group life, group medical, and credit life insurance. These premiums are estimated and recognized as revenue over time, with unearned portions recorded as liabilities. CVS recognizes unearned premiums as part of 'other insurance liabilities' on its consolidated balance sheets, recognizing revenue when earned, particularly for premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods. MetLife reflects unearned premiums as liabilities until earned, particularly for short-duration group term life, dental, disability, accident & health, vision, and credit insurance contracts, recognizing premiums on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term. This reveals that while all three companies defer revenue recognition for unearned premiums, they differ in categorization, estimation methods, and the types of contracts to which these principles are applied most prominently.",

          "chunk_text": "Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability. Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including taking actions to reduce certain costs and optimize our business. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to cost-effectively hire and retain people with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions, particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations, we may incur increased costs, which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability.\n\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable. Our contract profitability  is highly  dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client's satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nMoreover, many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy  these measures, it could significantly  reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms, any of which could significantly affect our profitability. We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients' actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved. Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nWe are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients' businesses. These deals may involve transforming a client's business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business. The scale and complexity of these projects present risks in execution and profitability challenges as a result of the costs we incur and investments we make at the beginning of these transactions. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the anticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or provide anticipated productivity gains, or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. A ny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\n\n## Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\n\nIn addition, our effectiv e tax  rate in the future could be adv ersely  affected by  challenges to our intercompany  transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company has business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incenEves within net revenue that could be either fixed or variable.  Variable rebates and incenEves are recorded primarily when volume- and transacEonbased revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Variable rebates and incenEves are calculated based upon esEmated customer performance, such as volume  thresholds,  and  the  terms  of  the  related  business  agreements.

For further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as Trading assets, see Note 4.\n\nLending Commitments. The Firm records the liability and related expense for the  fair  value  ex posure  related  to  commitments  to  fund  loans  that  will  be measured  at  fair  value.  The  liability  is  recorded  in  Trading  liabilities  in  the balance sheet, and the expense is recorded in Trading revenues in the income statement.\n\nBecause such loans and lending commitments are reported at fair value, the allowance for credit losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.\n\nFor further information on loans, see Note 9. For more information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see Note 14.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe ACL for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance  sheet  exposures  (e.g ., HFI  loans  and  lending  commitments,  HTM securities, customer and other receivables and certain guarantees) represents an  estimate  of  ex pected  credit  losses  over  the  entire  life  of  the  financial instrument.\n\nFactors  considered  by  management  when  determining  the  ACL  include payment status, fair value of collateral and ex pected payments of principal and interest,  as  well  as  internal  or  ex ternal  information  relating  to  past  events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Firm uses three forecasts that include  assumptions  about  certain  macroeconomic variables, including, but not limited to, U.S. gross domestic product ('GDP'), equity  market  indices  and  unemployment  rates,  as  well  as  commercial  real estate and home price indices. At the conclusion of the Firm's reasonable and supportable forecast period of 13 quarters, there is a gradual reversion back to historical averages.\n\nThe ACL is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist for multiple instruments, considering all available information relevant to assessing  the  collectability  of  cash  flows.  G enerally,  the  Firm  applies  a probability of default/loss given default model for instruments that are collectively assessed, under which the ACL is calculated as the product of probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. These parameters are forecast for each collective group of assets using a scenario-based statistical model.\n\nIf  the  instrument  does  not  share  similar  risk  characteristics  with  other instruments,  including  when  it  is  probable  that  the  Firm  will  be  unable  to collect the full payment of principal and interest on the instrument when due, the ACL  is  measured  on  an  individual  basis.  The  Firm  generally  applies  a discounted cash flow method for instruments that are individually assessed.\n\nThe Firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the fair value of the collateral  when  measuring  the ACL  if  the  loan  is  collateral  dependent  (i.e ., repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation  of  the  underlying  collateral  and  the  borrower  is  ex periencing financial difficulty).\n\nAdditionally, the Firm can elect to use an approach to measure the ACL that considers the fair value of collateral where the borrower is required to, and reasonably  expected  to,  continually  adjust  and  replenish  the  amount  of collateral securing the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of such collateral.  The  Firm  has  elected  to  use  this  approach  for  certain  securitiesbased  loans,  margin  loans,  securities  purchased  under  agreements  to  resell and securities borrowed.\n\nCredit quality indicators considered in developing the ACL include:\n\n- Corporate loans, secured lending facilities, commercial real estate loans and securities, and other loans: Internal risk ratings developed by the CRM that are  refreshed  at  least  annually,  and  more  frequently  as  necessary.  These ratings generally correspond to external ratings published by S&amp;P.

      "answer": "AIG reports a Moody's short-term debt rating of 'P-2', which is the second-highest tier within Moody's short-term rating scale. CVS also holds a 'P-2' rating from Moody's on its short-term debt, despite having executed multiple early debt extinguishments with significant premiums, suggesting continued access to favorable financing terms. MO similarly maintains a 'P-2' short-term debt rating from Moody's, despite carrying a higher long-term debt rating of 'A3'. Collectively, the consistent 'P-2' rating across all three firms indicates a shared perception of adequate short-term creditworthiness, though AIG and MO exhibit stronger long-term credit positioning relative to CVS, which has actively managed its debt through costly early repayments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and  government  regulations  -  prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

ORCL highlights that other tax credits are a key component of its valuation allowance totaling $1.9 billion, suggesting uncertainty in their future utilization. TSLA shows a significant increase in other tax credits and attributes from $827 million in 2023 to $1,325 million in 2024, reflecting growing deferred tax assets that may support future tax savings. Together, these figures reveal differing approaches to tax credit utilization: MET experiences a near-term tax cost, ORCL maintains caution around realizability, and TSLA appears to be accumulating credits for future benefit.",

If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2024, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $2.0 billion.\n\nOur net deferred tax assets were $8.6 billion and $6.5 billion as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable i ncome in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable i ncome change.\n\nThe valuation allowance was $1.9 billion as of May 31, 2024 and 2023. A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2024 and 2023 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first.",

      "answer": "Danaher reported a Balance, December 31, 2020 of $35,420 million, significantly influenced by $10,402 million attributable to 2020 acquisitions and $2,489 million from foreign currency translation and other adjustments. Merck\u2019s Balance, December 31, 2020 was $18,882 million, with $847 million from acquisitions and $20 million net impact from other adjustments, showing a more modest approach to portfolio expansion. Pfizer\u2019s Balance, December 31, 2020 in its Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income was $-5,310 million, impacted by $-5,450 million in foreign currency translation adjustments and a $116 million unrealized gain from available-for-sale securities, indicating a more complex exposure through restructuring and global diversification. Together, these figures reveal distinct strategic postures: DHR focused on aggressive acquisition-led growth, MRK on selective expansion with minimal divestitures, and PFE managing a broader set of global and restructuring-related financial impacts.",

      "question": "How do NFLX, T, and UNP each prioritize their near-term versus long-term financial commitments under 'Total Contractual Obligations,' and what does this reveal about their respective capital allocation strategies in 2024?",
      "answer": "NFLX allocates $14.43 billion (31% of total obligations) to near-term commitments within the next 12 months, with the remaining $31.43 billion (69%) extending beyond, indicating a strong focus on long-term content and debt obligations. T has $27.84 billion (9% of total obligations) due within the next five years and $200.46 billion (64%) beyond five years, showing a very long-dated liability structure dominated by debt and interest payments. UNP, in contrast, allocates $4.02 billion (6.5% of total obligations) to the next five years and $46.20 billion (75%) beyond, reflecting a capital-intensive, infrastructure-focused model with long-dated debt. Collectively, these patterns reveal differing capital intensity and liquidity strategies across the tech and infrastructure sectors.",
