Amgen accounts for contingent consideration obligations using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows, with significant unobservable inputs including the likelihood and timing of achieving development milestones. Merck incurred a $750 million charge in 2024 for the acquisition of MK-1045 and has committed to up to $300 million in future development milestones for that asset.

The transaction was accounted for as the sale of an asset. Upon completion of the transaction, AbbVie received net cash proceeds of $215 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $172 million which was recorded in other operating income in the consolidated statement of earnings in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Other Arrangements\n\nIn addition to the significant arrangements described above, AbbVie entered into several other arrangements resulting in charges related to upfront payments of $975 million in 2024, $582 million in 2023 and $315 million in 2022. In connection with the other individually insignificant early-stage arrangements entered into in 2024, AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $10.1 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense also included development milestones of $130 million in 2024, $196 million in 2023 and $252 million in 2022.\n\n## Note 6 Collaborations\n\nThe company has ongoing transactions with other entities through collaboration agreements. The following represent the significant collaboration agreements impacting 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.\n\nIn December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of Imbruvica, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and certain compounds structurally related to Imbruvica, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States.\n\nThe collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize Imbruvica outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs.\n\nIn the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of Imbruvica are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line i tems, net of Janssen's share.\n\nOutside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize Imbruvica. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and l osses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n",

The fair values of our money market mutual funds and equity investments in publicly traded securities, including our equity investments in BeiG ene and Neumora, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, are based on quoted market prices in active markets, with no valuation adjustment .\n\n## Derivatives\n\nAll of our foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts are with counterparties that have minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P, Moody's or Fitch. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by taking into consideration valuations obtained from a third-party valuation service that uses an income-based industry-standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs, as applicable, include foreign currency exchange rates, SOFR, swap rates, obligor credit default swap rates and cross-currency basis swap spreads. Certain inputs, when applicable, are at commonly quoted intervals. See Note 19, Derivative instruments.\n\n## Contingent consideration obligations\n\nAs a result of our business acquisitions, we have incurred contingent consideration obligations as discussed below. The contingent consideration obligations are recorded at their fair values by using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows, and we revalue these obligations each reporting period until the related contingencies have been resolved. The fair value measurements of these obligations are based on significant unobservable inputs related to licensing rights and product candidates acquired in business combinations, and they are reviewed quarterly by management in our R&amp;D and commercial sales organizations. The inputs include, as applicable, estimated probabilities and the timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as estimated annual sales. Significant changes that increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the related development, regulatory and commercial events or that shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve such events or that increase or decrease estimated annual sales would result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of the obligations, as applicable. Changes in the fair values of contingent consideration obligations are recognized in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.",

In addition, Curon is eligible to receive future contingent developmental milestone payments of up to $300 million and regulatory milestone payments of up to $300 million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. M erck recorded a charge of $750 million (reflecting the upfront payment and other related costs) to Research and development expenses in 2024 related to the execution of the transaction. In connection with the agreement, M erck is also obligated to pay a third party future contingent developmental, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments of up to $128 million in the aggregate, as well as tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit rate to a lowdouble-digit rate on future net sales of M K-1045, if approved.\n\nIn July 2024, M erck acquired the aqua business of Elanco A nimal Health Incorporated (Elanco aqua business) for total consideration of $1.3 billion. The Elanco aqua business consists of an innovative portfolio of medicines and vaccines, nutritionals and supplements for aquatic species; two related aqua manufacturing facilities in Canada and V ietnam; as well as a research facility in Chile. The acquisition broadens A nimal Health's aqua portfolio with products, such as Clynav , a new generation DNA -based vaccine that protects A tlantic salmon against pancreas disease, and Imvixa , an anti-parasitic sea lice treatment. This acquisition also brings a portfolio of water treatment products for warm water production, complementing A nimal Health's warm water vaccine portfolio. In addition to these products, the DNA -based vaccine technology that is a part of the business has the potential to accelerate the development of novel vaccines to address the unmet needs of the aqua industry . There are no contingent payments associated with the acquisition, which was accounted for as a business combination.\n\nThe estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Elanco aqua business are as follows:\n\n",

A valuation allowance is provided for tax assets that will more likely than not go unused.\n\nThe financial statements reflect ex pected future tax  consequences of uncertain tax  positions that the company has taken or ex pects to take on a tax  return presuming the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money (see Note 7).\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Swedish krona, Singapore dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Swiss franc. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the eurodenominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\nThe fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is included in the accompanying balance sheets under the caption other assets or other long-term liabilities. The fair value of the currency exchange contracts is included in the accompanying balance sheets under the captions other current assets or other accrued expenses.\n\n## Leases\n\nOperating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases that have commenced are included in property, plant and equipment, net, current maturities of long-term obligations and long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the ex pected timing of payments due under the company's obligations.\n\nRight-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes operating lease",

Restructuring\n\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program.\n\nIn total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2021:\n\n",

These differences suggest that Abbott experiences significantly higher pension-related financial pressure compared to Eli Lilly and Merck, which may reflect variations in plan design, geographic exposure, or demographic assumptions.",

The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. A mounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\n\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. A mounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company's operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\n\n",

For transactions other than a business combination, we capitalize milestone payments incurred at or after the product has obtained regulatory approv al for marketing.\n\nAcquired IPR&amp;D consists of the fair v alues of acquired IPR&amp;D projects acquired in business combinations, adjusted for subsequent impairments, if any. The costs of acquired IPR&amp;D projects acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination are capitalized as other intangible assets if the projects hav e an alternativ e future use; otherwise, they are expensed immediately. See Note 3 for significant acquired IPR&amp;D projects that had no alternativ e future use.\n\nSeveral methods may be used to determine the estimated fair v alue of other intangibles acquired in a business combination. We utilize the \"income method,\" which is a Lev el 3 fair v alue measurement and applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of dev elopment and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flows that are deriv ed from projected rev enues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relev ant market size, patent protection, historical pricing of similar products, analyst expectations, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present v alue using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is performed for each asset independently. The acquired IPR&amp;D assets are treated as indefinite-liv ed intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects, at which time the assets are tested for impairment and amortized ov er the remaining useful life or written off, as appropriate.\n\nIndefinite-liv ed intangible assets are rev iewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by first assessing qualitativ e factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair v alue of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair v alue is less than the carrying amount, a quantitativ e test that compares the fair v alue of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. Finite-liv ed intangible assets are rev iewed for impairment when an indicator of impairment is present. When required, a comparison of fair v alue to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. When determining the fair v alue of indefinite-liv ed acquired IPR&amp;D as well as the fair v alue of finite-liv ed intangible assets for impairment testing purposes, we utilize the \"income method\" discussed abov e.",

Finance lease ex pense includes depreciation, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the ex pected life of the leased asset, and an immaterial amount of interest expense.\n\nBecause most of the company's leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the company estimates incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms include the effect of options to ex tend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will ex ercise that option.\n\nAs a lessee, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component (see Note 13).\n\n## Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nThe company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive items, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost/(income). Other comprehensive items is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost/(income).\n\nWhen a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.\n\nThe company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension benefit cost/(income) reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations. The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fix ed-income corporate bonds and the related ex pected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.\n\nThe company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine net periodic pension benefit cost/(income) reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In determining the ex pected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.\n\nAsset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.\n\nThe expected rate of compensation increase used to determine net periodic pension benefit cost/(income) reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management's expectations of future salary increases (see Note 14).\n\n## Stock-based Compensation Expense\n\nCompensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier, and is primarily included in selling, general and administrative ex penses.\n\nThe company's practice is to grant stock options at fair market value. Options vest over 3-5 years with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with certain ex ceptions. V esting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions. The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the company's stock. Historical data on ex ercise patterns is the basis for estimating the ex pected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.

MRK shows a longer weighted-average remaining contractual term of 5.9 years for both outstanding and vested options, suggesting a more extended vesting horizon. In contrast, GILD discloses a much shorter weighted-average period of 1.1 years for unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested PSUs, pointing to a more accelerated vesting schedule.

The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

Merck receives tiered royalties ranging from 20% to 24% based on sales levels. This royalty will be reduced by 50% upon the earlier of patent expiry or generic entry on an indication-by-indication basis in each market. A dditionally, M erck is eligible to receive future contingent sales-based milestone payments of up to $80 million. A lliance revenue related to this collaboration (recorded within Sales ) consists of royalties and, for 2022, also includes the receipt of a regulatory approval milestone payment of $20 million. M erck recorded alliance revenue related to this collaboration of $371 million in 2024, $212 million in 2023 and $166 million in 2022.\n\n## 5.    R estructuring\n\nIn  January 2024, the Company approved a new restructuring program (2024 Restructuring Program) intended to continue the optimization of the Company's  Human  Health  global  manufacturing  network  as  the  future  pipeline  shifts  to  new  modalities  and  also  optimize  the  A nimal  Health  global manufacturing network to improve supply reliability and increase efficiency . The actions contemplated under the 2024 Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially  completed  by  the  end  of  2031,  with  the  cumulative  pretax  costs  to  be  incurred  by   the  Company  to  implement  the  program  estimated  to  be approximately $4.0 billion. A pproximately 60% of the cumulative pretax costs will be non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. The remainder of the costs will result in cash outlays, relating primarily to facility shut-down costs. The Company recorded total pretax costs of $888 million and $190 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively , related to the 2024 Restructuring Program, bringing total cumulative pretax costs incurred through December 31, 2024 to $1.1 billion.\n\nIn 2019, M erck approved a global restructuring program (2019 Restructuring Program) as part of a worldwide initiative focused on optimizing the Company's manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate footprint. The Company recorded total pretax costs of $743 million in 2023 and $666 million in 2022 related to the 2019 Restructuring Program. The actions under the 2019 Restructuring Program were substantially complete at the end of 2023 and, as of January 1, 2024, any remaining activities are being accounted for as part of the 2024 Restructuring Program.\n\nFor segment reporting, restructuring charges are unallocated expenses.",

      "answer": "DHR reported a decrease in interest income by $186 million in 2024 compared to 2023 due to lower average cash balances, primarily driven by cash used for share repurchases and acquisitions. GILD noted a decline in interest income due to lower average cash balances, which contributed to unfavorable movements in its 'Other (income) expense, net' line item. TMO actively hedges its cash balances denominated in foreign currencies using derivative contracts to manage exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, indicating a more proactive risk management approach.

Interest income of $117 million for 2024 was $186 million lower than in 2023, due to lower av erage cash balances in 2024 primarily as a result of the use of cash for share repurchases and acquisitions.\n\nFor a further description of the Company's debt and cross-currency swap deriv ativ e contracts related to the debt as of December 31, 2024 refer to Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n## General\n\nIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.\n\nThe Company's effectiv e tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the v aluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of prev iously filed tax returns (as further discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities, changes in tax laws and regulations, and legislativ e policy changes that may result from the OECD's initiativ e on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinv ested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to '-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Cash and Cash Requirements' below.\n\nThe amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these rev iews, which take into account the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the other factors referenced in the prior paragraph, reserv es for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors'.\n\nYear-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Prov ision and Effectiv e Tax Rate\n\n",

A valuation allowance is provided for tax assets that will more likely than not go unused.\n\nThe financial statements reflect ex pected future tax  consequences of uncertain tax  positions that the company has taken or ex pects to take on a tax  return presuming the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the positions and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money (see Note 7).\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Swedish krona, Singapore dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Swiss franc. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the eurodenominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\nThe fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is included in the accompanying balance sheets under the caption other assets or other long-term liabilities. The fair value of the currency exchange contracts is included in the accompanying balance sheets under the captions other current assets or other accrued expenses.\n\n## Leases\n\nOperating leases that have commenced are included in other assets, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases that have commenced are included in property, plant and equipment, net, current maturities of long-term obligations and long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheet. Classification of lease liabilities as either current or noncurrent is based on the ex pected timing of payments due under the company's obligations.\n\nRight-of-use (ROU) assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The company recognizes operating lease",

          "chunk_text": "Pursuant  to  the  Collaboration  Agreement,  Gilead  had  the  right  to  opt  in  to  all  current  and  future  clinical-stage  product candidates for up to ten years following the closing of the transaction. In November 2021, we exercised our options to three of Arcus' clinical stage programs and amended the Collaboration Agreement. The option exercise and amendment transaction closed in  December 2021, triggering collaboration  opt-in  payments  of  $725  million  and  waiving  the  $100  million  option  continuation payment which would have been due to Arcus in the third quarter of 2022. The net option charge of $625 million was recorded within Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021. The collaboration opt-in payments of $725 million were recorded in Accrued and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  paid  to Arcus  in  January  2022.  Our  payments  to Arcus  will  be  included  within  Net  cash provided by investing activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the first quarter of 2022. Under the amended Collaboration  Agreement,  the  companies  will  co-develop  and  share  the  global  costs  related  to  these  clinical  programs.  If  the optioned molecules achieve regulatory approval, the companies will co-commercialize and equally share profits in the U.S. Gilead will hold exclusive commercialization rights outside the U.S., subject to any rights of Arcus's existing collaboration partners, and will pay to Arcus tiered royalties as a percentage of net sales ranging from the mid-teens and low twenties. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we may also pay an additional $100 million at our option on each of the fourth, sixth and eighth anniversaries of the agreement, unless terminated early, to maintain the rights to opt-in to future Arcus programs for the duration of the contact term.\n\nWe elected and applied the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Arcus whereby the investment is marked to  market  each  reporting  period  based  on  the  market  price  of Arcus  shares.  We  believe  the  fair  value  option  best  reflects  the underlying economics of the investment. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded pre-tax unrealized gains  of  $127  million  and  $80  million,  respectively,  related  to  our  investment  in Arcus  in  Other  income  (expense),  net  on  our Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  We  initially  recorded  our  equity  investments  in  Arcus  in  Other  long-term  assets  on  our Consolidated Balance Sheets as the investments were subject to contractual lock-up provisions for a period of two years from the closing date of the Stock Purchase Agreements, subject to certain conditions. In the third quarter of 2021, we reclassified our equity investments in Arcus to Prepaid and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as the contractual lock-up provisions are expected to expire in July 2022. Our equity investment in Arcus was $559 million and $212 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Pionyr\n\nOn June 19, 2020, we entered into a transaction with Pionyr, a privately held company pursuing novel biology in the field of immuno-oncology, which included entry into two separate merger agreements, one contemplating the initial acquisition of a 49.9% equity interest in Pionyr, and the other providing us the exclusive option, subject to certain terms and conditions, to acquire the remaining  outstanding  capital  stock  of  Pionyr  (together,  the  'Pionyr  Merger  and  Option  Agreements')  and  a  research  and development service agreement.\n\nOn July 13, 2020, we closed the transaction and made cash payments of $269 million. We account for our investment in Pionyr  using  the  equity  method  of  accounting  because  our  equity  interest  provides  us  with  the  ability  to  exercise  significant influence over Pionyr. Our investment in Pionyr, consisting of the transaction price noted above and transaction costs, exceeded our pro-rata portion of Pionyr's net assets at transaction closing. We determined that the resulting basis difference primarily relates to Pionyr's  IPR&amp;D  which  has  no  alternative  future  use  and  that  Pionyr  is  not  a  business  as  defined  in  ASC  805,  'Business Combinations.' As a result, we immediately recorded a charge for this basis difference of $215 million in Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our equity method investment in Pionyr was zero as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe estimated fair value of our exclusive option to acquire the remaining outstanding capital stock of Pionyr is approximately $70 million based on a probability-weighted option pricing model using unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 under the  fair  value  measurement  and  disclosure  guidance.  The  estimated  amount  is  recorded  in  Other  long-term  assets  on  our Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  We  may  choose  to  exercise  our  exclusive  option  to  purchase  the  remaining  equity  interest  from Pionyr's current shareholders for a $315 million option exercise fee and up to $1.2 billion in potential future milestone payments upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Such option to purchase will expire following the earliest occurrence of specified events, including the delivery of data following completion of certain Phase 1b trials by Pionyr.\n\nUnder the research and development service agreement, we made an initial cash funding of $80 million and recorded a charge in  Acquired  in-process  research  and  development  expenses  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  during  the  year  ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we committed to provide additional payments of up to $115 million to Pionyr upon achievement of certain development milestones. We accrued $70 million in milestone payments, related to the initiation of two Phase 1 studies, with a charge to Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2020, and the payment was made in the first quarter of 2021.",

The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The lease liability was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in 2021and 2020, respectively. The operating lease costs were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Product Liability\n\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\n\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company's operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating Activities\n\nCash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in  our  results  of  operations. As  a  result,  changes  in  cash  from  operating  activities  reflect  the  timing  of  cash  collections  from  customers  and  alliance  partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe $1.3 billion increase in cash flow provided by operating activities compared to 2023, was primarily due to higher customer collections, net of rebates, discounts, and alliance payments ($3.4 billion) and lower income tax payments ($450 million), partially offset by higher acquisition-related payments, including cash settlement of unvested stock awards ($1.0 billion), and higher interest ex pense payments on debt ($600 million), as well as timing of payments in the ordinary course of business.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase, proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties), the sale and maturity of marketable securities, sale of equity investments, as well as upfront and contingent milestones payments from licensing arrangements.\n\nThe $19.1 billion increase in cash flow used in investing activities compared to 2023 was due to payments for the Mirati, RayzeBio and Karuna acquisitions and SystImmune collaboration of $20.7 billion, partially offset by changes in the amount of marketable debt securities held of $1.4 billion.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.\n\nThe $14.5 billion change in cash provided by financing activities compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher net borrowings of $9.6 billion used primarily to fund our acquisitions and share repurchases of $5.2 billion in 2023.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nFor  recently  issued  accounting  standards,  refer  to  'Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data-Note  1. Accounting  Policies  and  Recently  Issued Accounting Standards.'\n\n## SEC Consent Order\n\nAs previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004.\n\nUnder the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of  inventory  on  hand,  without  making  a  timely  public  disclosure  of  any  change  in  practice.  We  also  agreed  in  the  Consent  to  certain  measures  that  we  have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.\n\nWe have established a company-wide policy concerning our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.",

The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receiv able, inv entories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectiv ely the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectiv ely represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.\n- The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $695 million in operating cash flows during 2024, compared to $828 million used in 2023. The timing of cash payments and refunds for taxes and the impact of deferred tax benefits and charges, v arious employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drov e the majority of this change.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash flows relating to inv esting activ ities consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, acquisitions, inv estments and cash proceeds from div estitures of businesses or assets.\n\nNet cash used in inv esting activ ities was approximately $2.0 billion during 2024 compared to approximately $7.1 billion of net cash used in 2023.\n\n## Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of Investments\n\nFor a discussion of the Company's acquisitions and div estitures refer to '-Ov erv iew' and Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in 2024 and 2023, the Company inv ested $331 million and $172 million, respectiv ely, in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nThough the relativ e significance of particular categories of capital inv estment can change from period to period, capital expenditures are typically made for increasing manufacturing capacity, the manufacture of instruments that are used in OTL arrangements, purchases of buildings, replacing equipment, supporting new product dev elopment and improv ing information technology systems. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.4 billion in both 2024 and 2023.\n\nDuring 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. gov ernment, including the Biomedical Adv anced Research and Dev elopment Authority ('BARDA') within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Biotechnology businesses and the dev elopment of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing, the U.S. gov ernment has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and is being paid over periods ranging from one year to four years. In 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded amounts related to these grants and other gov ernment assistance that offset operating expenses of $43 million and $51 million, respectiv ely, and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $198 million and $136 million, respectiv ely. Property, plant and equipment purchased using funds prov ided by gov ernments are recorded net of gov ernment assistance.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activ ities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock, payments of cash div idends to shareholders and proceeds from the Separation. Financing activ ities used cash of approximately $8.4 billion during 2024 compared to $273 million of cash used during 2023. The year-ov er-year increase in cash used by financing activ ities was due primarily to the repurchase of approximately $6.0 billion of the Company's common stock in 2024, compared to the approximately $2.6 billion Veralto Distribution receiv ed in 2023 in connection with the Separation. In 2025, the Company anticipates paying approximately $60 million of excise tax related to the 2024 share repurchases.\n\nTotal debt was approximately $16.0 billion and $18.4 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely, including notes payable and current portion of long-term debt of $505 million and approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had the ability to incur approximately $4.0 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts av ailable under the Company's $5.0 billion unsecured, multiyear rev olv ing credit facility ('Credit Facility') which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances.

Declining tax rev enues and increased gov ernment spending on other programs attributable to unev en economic growth or downturns increase the pressure on gov ernments to reduce healthcare spending, leading to increased control of drug prices or lower utilization. Additionally, some customers, including gov ernments or other entities reliant upon gov ernment funding and cash-pay patients, may be unable to pay for our products fully or in a timely manner. Also, if our customers, suppliers, or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. Similarly, unev en economic growth or downturns could limit our ability to access capital markets.\n\nIn addition, significant portions of our business are conducted in Europe, Asia, and other international geographies. Trade and other global disputes and interruptions, including related to tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other gov ernments, international tension and conflicts, as well as economic stagnation, cost inflation, strains on global transportation, manufacturing, and labor markets, and public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics affect our ability to do business. Among other risks, the use of tariffs and other trade restrictions increase costs and may impact clinical trials or sales of our products, or otherwise complicate aspects of our business. In particular, tensions between the U.S. and China, which hav e already led to a series of tariffs and sanctions, as well as other business restrictions, could further escalate based on additional trade restrictions or retaliation thereto. In February 2025, the U.S. presidential administration imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded with tariffs on select U.S. goods. Additionally, tariffs were proposed or threatened with respect to other jurisdictions, including Mexico, Canada and Europe. If geopolitical tensions were to increase and disrupt our operations in, or related to, China or other major international geographies, such disruption would significantly impact our business. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Operations-Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adv ersely affect our business,\" for additional information. As a further example, the financial impact of higher energy prices, defense spending, and geopolitical and economic disruptions, has further exacerbated financial pressures on gov ernments with single-payer or gov ernment funded healthcare systems, leading to increased impetus for increases in rebates, clawbacks, and other reforms to reimbursement systems, particularly in Europe. These and similar ev ents hav e adv ersely affected, and may continue to adv ersely affect, us, our business partners, and our customers.

In recent periods, significant fluctuations in currency rates and inflation hav e impacted our results of operations. We are a net receiv er of foreign currencies, and our results of operations are adv ersely impacted when the U.S. dollar is strong compared to foreign currencies. Further, in the ev ent of an extreme dev aluation of local currency in a particular market in which we operate, the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relev ant market. Inflationary pressures in recent periods hav e also negativ ely impacted us and may continue to negativ ely impact us in v arious ways, including cost inflation, higher labor costs, and other higher expenses, with some of these higher expenses due in part to policy actions intended to curb inflation.

Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or div erted drugs sold under our brand name, which may also impact our business and financial results.\n\nIn addition, we rely on our ability to attract, engage, and retain highly qualified and skilled scientific, technical, management, and other personnel in order to compete effectiv ely. To continue to commercialize our products, and adv ance the research, dev elopment, and commercialization of additional modalities, indications, and product candidates, we hav e expanded, and will likely need to further expand, our workforce, both in and outside the U.S. We continue to face intense competition for qualified indiv iduals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic and other research institutions, as well as employers near our manufacturing and other facilities, which has and may continue to increase our labor costs. Our failure to compete effectiv ely for talent could negativ ely affect sales of our current and any future approved products and indications, and could result in material financial, legal, commercial, or reputational harm to our business.\n\n- Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation or business.\n\nPublic and priv ate payers continue to take aggressiv e steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medicines. These pressures hav e negativ ely affected, and we expect will continue to negativ ely affect, our consolidated results of operations. Gov ernments and priv ate payers worldwide hav e intensified their scrutiny of, and actions intended to address, pricing, reimbursement, and access to pharmaceutical products and are demanding greater commercial and clinical v alue from pharmaceutical companies in the form of strong product differentiation and demonstrated v alue. We continue to experience scrutiny on the pricing of current and potential diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease products due to payer concern ov er projected growth in these markets and, for certain of these drugs, the anticipated duration of treatment. We hav e also observ ed scrutiny of pricing and access disparities across jurisdictions.\n\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including because of the regulatory priorities of the U.S. executiv e branch and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, in August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to gov ernment-set prices in Medicare effectiv e in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the gov ernment-set prices for these first ten medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Giv en our product portfolio, we expect additional products will be selected in future years, which would have the effect of accelerating rev enue erosion. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. Within the U.S., state lev el transparency initiativ es, importation rules, reporting requirements, and mandated programs, including the establishment of drug affordability boards with the power to set upper payment limits on certain drugs in state-regulated plans, hav e also increased administrativ e costs, in some cases, compromised confidential business practices and otherwise detrimentally impacted our business. Certain states hav e also undertaken efforts to codify 340B contract pharmacies into statute or impose other state law mandates, which increase the cost of 340B programs. To date, sev eral states hav e passed contract pharmacy legislation, which hav e been subject to v arious legal challenges. For more details, see Item 1, \"Business-Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access.\"\n\nFurther, restrictiv e or unfav orable pricing, cov erage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by gov ernments, regulatory agencies, courts, or priv ate payers, including in relation to the implementation of the IRA, reference pricing, and compulsory licensing, may adversely impact our business and financial results. We continue to experience additional pricing pressures, rebates, clawbacks, and other changes in reimbursement policies and programs resulting from periods of unev en economic growth or downturns or uncertainty, and the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts.",

Cost of sales includes the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, collaborations, and licensing arrangements, which totaled $2.4 billion in 2024 and $2.0 billion in 2023.

Some of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, has affected and in future periods may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate are generally subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage (such as Medicaid eligibility redeterminations in certain states), reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in, or prevent our ex pansion into, certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For ex ample, CMS in the past has reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid programs. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. Chronic failure to meet the benchmarks could result in termination of these government contracts. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submissions by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting specified quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments, and CMS has and may make changes to the star rating program that impact the ability of plans to achieve four-star or higher ratings. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans and the number of people we serve. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to maintain or improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet evolving government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or ex clusion from these or other government programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nCMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding and adjust monthly capitation payments for Medicare programs. For Medicare Advantage plans, these adjustments are made according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers. For Medicare Part D plans, payment adjustments are driven by risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process.

DHR discloses a settlement loss of $10 million in 2022 related to non-U.S. pension liabilities and separates service cost components across cost of goods sold and SG&A, showing a more complex and segmented impact. PFE highlights that a 50 basis point decline in the expected annual rate of return on plan assets would significantly affect net periodic benefit costs, signaling high sensitivity to investment performance. Together, these disclosures reveal varying degrees of financial exposure and strategic sensitivity to pension and postretirement obligations across the three companies.",

The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following respects: (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and (iii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the applicable plan, which is referred to as a withdrawal liability.\n\nNone of the multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates are individually significant to the Company. The Company's contributions to multiemployer pension plans were $19 million, $19 million and $20 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Other Postretirement Benefits\n\nThe Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees who meet eligibility requirements. The Company's funding policy is generally to pay covered expenses as they are incurred. For retiree medical plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rates. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company's other postretirement benefits had an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $147 million and $155 million, respectively. Net periodic benefit costs related to these other postretirement benefits were $6 million, $6 million and $4 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Other Components of Net Period Benefit Costs\n\nThe Company disaggregates the serv ice cost component of net periodic benefit costs of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans. The serv ice cost component is presented in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrativ e expenses. The other components of net periodic benefit costs are presented in other income (expense), net. These other components of net period benefit costs include the assumed rate of return on plan assets, partially offset by amortization of actuarial losses and interest. The Company's net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a settlement loss of $10 million ($9 million after-tax), as a result of the transfer of a portion of its non-U.S. pension liabilities related to one defined benefit plan to a third-party.\n\n## Investment Gains (Losses)\n\nFor inv estments in equity securities without readily av ailable fair v alues, the Company has elected the Fair Value Alternativ e and records adjustments to fair v alue within net earnings. Additionally, the Company is a limited partner in partnerships that inv est primarily in early stage companies. While the partnerships record these inv estments at fair v alue, the Company's inv estments in the partnerships are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The inv estment gains (losses) include realized and unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair v alue of the Company's inv estments in equity securities and the Company's equity in earnings of the partnerships that reflect the changes in fair v alue of the inv estments of the partnerships and related management fees and operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2024 the Company sold a portion of its shares of an equity method inv estment and recorded a realized inv estment gain of $180 million ($135 million after-tax). In addition, during 2023 and 2022 the Company recorded impairments of $31 million and $91 million, respectiv ely, related to equity method inv estments that are reflected in unrealized inv estment gains (losses).\n\n## NOTE 9. LEASES\n\nThe Company has operating leases for office space, warehouses, distribution centers, research and dev elopment facilities, manufacturing locations and certain equipment, primarily automobiles. Many leases include one or more options to renew, some of which include options to extend for up to 30 years, and some leases include options to terminate within 30 days. In certain of the Company's lease agreements, the rental payments are adjusted periodically to reflect actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, inflation and/or changes in other indexes. The Company's finance leases were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. ROU assets arising from finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net and the liabilities are included in notes payable and current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\n\nIn 2019, we substantially completed several multi-year initiatives focused on positioning us for future growth and creating a simpler, more efficient operating structure within each business.\n\n## A. Transforming to a More Focused Company Program\n\nWith the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer has transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base and support model align appropriately with our new operating structure. While certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. This program is primarily composed of the following three initiatives:\n\n- We are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&amp;D and PGS platform functions. We expect costs, primarily related to restructuring our corporate enabling functions, to total $1.6 billion, with substantially all costs to be cash expenditures. Actions include, among others, changes in location of certain activities, expanded use and co-location of centers of excellence and shared services, and increased use of digital technologies. The associated actions and the specific costs will primarily include severance and benefit plan impacts, exit costs as well as associated implementation costs.\n- In addition, we are transforming our commercial go-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. We expect costs of $1.1 billion, with substantially all costs to be cash expenditures. Actions include, among others, centralization of certain activities and enhanced use of digital technologies. The costs for this effort primarily include severance and associated implementation costs.\n- We are also optimizing our manufacturing network under this program and incurring one-time costs for cost-reduction initiatives related to our manufacturing operations. We expect to incur costs of $800 million, with approximately 25% of the costs to be non-cash. The costs for this effort include, among other things, severance costs, implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, as well as accelerated depreciation.\n\nThe program costs discussed above are expected to be incurred primarily from 2020 through 2022, and may be rounded and represent approximations.\n\nFrom the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through December 31, 2021, we incurred costs of $2.2 billion, of which $856 million is associated with Biopharma ($712 million in 2021, $79 million in 2020 and $64 million in 2019).\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n70",

This law has the potential to have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nThere is no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimates disclosed in this 2021 Form 10-K or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance.\n\n## Certain novel approaches to the treatment of diseases, such as chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T cell therapy, may present significant challenges and risks for us.\n\nThe  development  of  novel  approaches  for  the  treatment  of  diseases,  such  as  our  acquisition  in  November  2019  of Celgene's and Juno's CAR T cell therapy programs, including Breyanzi (liso-cel) and Abecma (ide-cel), presents many new challenges and risks due to the unique nature of genetic modification of patient cells ex vivo using certain viruses to reengineer  these  cells  to  ultimately  treat  diseases,  including  obtaining  regulatory  approval  from  U.S.  FDA  and  other regulatory agencies that have limited experience with the development of cellular therapies involving genetic modification of patient cells; developing and deploying consistent and reliable processes, while limiting contamination, for engineering a patient's cells ex vivo and infusing genetically modified cells back into the patient; developing processes for the safe administration of cellular therapies, including long-term follow-up for patients receiving cellular therapies; and sourcing additional clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our potential CAR T products. The use of reengineered cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by the regulatory, patient or medical communities.\n\nFurther, we may not be able to satisfactorily establish the safety and efficacy or the reliability of these therapies through health  authority  approval,  or  demonstrate  the  potential  advantages  and  side  effects  compared  to  existing  and  future therapies. Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. Furthermore, certain payment models could impact the financial feasibility of making CAR T cell therapies available in certain markets or by certain treatment sites, thereby limiting patient access. To date, only a few products  that  involve  the  genetic  modification  of  patient  cells  have  been  approved  for  commercial  sale.  Moreover,  the safety profiles of cellular therapies may adversely influence public perception and may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials, or if approved, of physicians and payers to subscribe to these novel treatment approaches. If we fail to overcome these and other challenges, or if significant adverse events are reported from similar therapies,  our  development  of  these  novel  treatment  approaches  may  be  hampered  or  delayed,  which  could  adversely affect our future anticipated revenues and/or profitability related to these therapeutic programs. In addition, we could also face  difficulties  in  manufacturing  CAR  T  cell  therapies,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  future  anticipated  revenues and/or profitability related to our CAR T cell therapies. See ' -We could experience difficulties, delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.'\n\n## We face intense competition from other manufacturers and expect to see increasing market penetration of lower-priced generic products.\n\nThe future growth of BMS is dependent on the market access, uptake and expansion for marketed brands, new product introductions,  new  indications,  product  extensions  and  co-promotional  activities  with  alliance  partners.  Competition  is keen and as we lose exclusivity for some of our marketed brands lower-priced generic products will increasingly penetrate our  markets.  Generic  challenges  to  our  products  can  also  arise  at  any  time,  and  our  patents  may  not  prevent  the emergence of generic competition for our products. For example, if we receive an adverse litigation decision in a country in the EU where our Eliquis composition of matter patents and related Supplementary Protection Certificates are being challenged (see 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies'), we may not be able to prevent generic apixaban products from being introduced in such country prior to our estimated minimum market exclusivity date. In some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the United States or in the EU; political and social pressure has also pushed legislation and other measures that promote the use  of  generic  and  biosimilar  products.  In  addition,  we  face  competition  from  new  products  entering  the  market, particularly in IO. New products may have (i) lower prices, (ii) superior efficacy (benefit) or safety (risk) profiles (whether actual  or  perceived),  (iii)  technological  advantages  that  may  make  such  products  more  convenient  to  use,  (iv)  better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, (v) more effective marketing programs and/or other differentiating factors that make it harder for our products to compete. We also face intense competition for external partnerships, joint ventures and  acquisition  targets  that  can  help  develop  and  bring  new  products  to  markets.  Business  combinations  among  our competitors and major third-party payers may increase competition",

Each of the Families First Act and the CARES Act requires the Company to provide coverage for COVID-19 related medical services, in many cases without member cost-sharing, in its Insured Health Care Benefits products.\n\nThe CARES Act also provides relief funding to providers to reimburse them for health care related expenses incurred in preventing, preparing for and/or responding to COVID-19 (provided no other source is obligated to reimburse those expenses) or lost health care related revenues that are attributable to COVID-19. Under the CARES Act, the Company receives reimbursement for uninsured patients in connection with COVID-19 testing and vaccination as well as monoclonal antibody treatment. Aside from such reimbursement, the Company has not requested any funding under the CARES Act. However, in the second quarter of 2020, the Company received $43 million from the CARES Act provider relief fund, all of which was returned to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ('HHS') during the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe CARES Act also allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer share of Social Security taxes effective March 27, 2020 by permitting them to remit the associated payments in two equal installments on or about December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. The Company elected to defer approximately $670 million of its Social Security tax payments during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company paid the first of two equal installments in December 2021 and will remit the second installment on or about December 31, 2022, as required under the CARES Act.\n\nCongress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act in March 2021. Among other changes, as a result of this legislation, Public Exchange plan premium subsidies increased for low-income individuals and became available to people with incomes higher than 400% of the federal poverty limit. These changes are currently in effect through the remainder of 2022, and Congress may extend, or potentially make permanent, these policies in subsequent legislation, which could cause continued shifts in enrollment into Public Exchange plans.\n\nIn addition to the Families First Act, the CARES Act, and the American Rescue Plan Act, the Company continues to experience new legislation, regulation, directives, orders and other requirements from federal, state, county and municipal authorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These governmental actions have included, but are not limited to, requirements to waive member costsharing associated with COVID-19 testing and treatment, provide coverage for additional COVID-19-related services, expand the use of telemedicine, extend grace periods for payments of premiums or limit coverage termination based on non-payment of premiums or fees, modify health benefits coverage eligibility rules to help maintain employee eligibility, and facilitate, accelerate or advance payments to providers, and other requirements related to the public health emergency. These requirements may impact different areas of our business differently and for different lengths of time, and present financial implications with respect to implementing and unwinding our compliance with these new requirements.\n\nThe Company has operations that fall within the scope of COVID-19 vaccine requirements for federal contractors, certain health care workers, and the requirements of certain jurisdictions such as New York City. Several of these are subject to judicial challenges. We are continuing to closely monitor and update our practices in response to developments or changes in the COVID19 vaccination policies established by various federal agencies as well as the several state- and municipal-specific COVID-19 vaccine mandates that provide expanded exemptions, modifications, requirements or restrictions regarding employee vaccinations. We have a process for employees to request a reasonable accommodation if they are unable to get vaccinated due to a medical condition, sincerely held religious belief, or any other legally recognized exemption. Employees must apply and be approved for a reasonable accommodation in order to be exempt from the vaccination requirement.\n\nAdditionally, in December 2021, the Biden administration reiterated CARES Act guidance noting commercial health insurers are not required to cover workplace or surveillance testing and announced several new directives and actions to combat COVID-19, including the expansion of free at-home testing to be covered by commercial health insurers for the remainder of the public health emergency. On January 10, 2022, the HHS announced that commercial health insurers must cover the costs of up to eight rapid OTC COVID-19 test kits per individual per 30-day period. This requirement will likely impact multiple business operations, including increasing benefit costs in our commercial health insurance business and increasing revenues in our retail business. The requirement may also result in a decrease in more expensive tests and treatments, which could partially mitigate the increase in benefit costs in our commercial health insurance business. These impacts will be highly dependent on the overall supply of testing products.",

In the U.S., these  include  (i)  practices  of  managed  care  groups  and  institutional  and  governmental  purchasers,  (ii)  U.S.  federal  laws  and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the ACA, and (iii) state activities aimed at increasing price transparency, including new laws as noted above in Item 1. 'Competition and the Health Care Environment.' Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the U.S.,  as  well  as  increased  purchasing  power  of  entities  that  negotiate  on  behalf  of  Medicare,  Medicaid,  and  private  sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, in the U.S., larger customers have received higher rebates on drugs  in  certain  highly  competitive  categories.  The  Company  must  also  compete  to  be  placed  on  formularies  of  managed  care organizations. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization.\n\nIn order to provide information about the Company's pricing practices, the Company annually posts on its website its Pricing  Transparency  Report  for  the  U.S.  The  report  provides  the  Company's  average  annual  list  price  and  net  price  increases across the Company's U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010. In 2021, the Company's gross U.S. sales were reduced by 43.5% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns.\n\nOutside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, Japan and China have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and, in that regard, fix the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Consequently, in those markets, the Company is subject to government decision making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In Japan,  the  pharmaceutical  industry  is  subject  to  government-mandated  annual  price  reductions  of  pharmaceutical  products  and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricing for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules.",

CVS provides a more detailed operational view, describing its nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans for key employees, including matching contributions equivalent to those in its 401(k) plan, and reports total defined contribution plan spending of $552 million in 2021. JNJ discloses a smaller deferred compensation liability of $181 million in 2021, suggesting a less prominent role of deferred compensation in its overall employee obligation structure. Together, these figures and disclosures reflect differing emphases on deferred compensation as a component of executive and key employee retention and benefits strategy across the three healthcare firms.",

At the participant's option, account balances, including the Company's matching contribution, can be invested among various investment options under each plan. The CVS Health Future Fund 401(k) Plan offers CVS Health Corporation's common stock fund as an investment option.

Bristol-Myers Squibb emphasizes the integration of R&D activities as part of its broader M&A strategy, noting that successful pipeline development depends on effectively integrating newly acquired entities' R&D functions, which introduces execution and synergy risks. Pfizer highlights the inherent uncertainty in R&D outcomes, specifically pointing to the risks around meeting clinical endpoints, regulatory approvals, and the interpretation of trial data, which could materially affect its business prospects. Collectively, these perspectives show that while all three companies prioritize R&D, Amgen focuses on internal stage-gated development, BMY ties R&D success to external growth strategies, and Pfizer underscores the volatility and risk in translating R&D into commercial success.",

Pretax income generated from royalties was approximately $1.9 billion in 2021. Our pretax income could be adversely affected if the royalty streams decline in future periods.\n\nFailure  to  effectively  manage  acquisitions,  divestitures,  alliances,  joint  ventures  and  other  portfolio  actions  could adversely  impact  our  future  results.  In  addition,  any  businesses  or  assets  that  we  acquire  in  the  future  may underperform, we may not be able to successfully integrate them into our existing business and the occurrence of a number of unexpected factors could prevent or substantially delay the consummation of an anticipated acquisition, divestiture or merger.\n\nWe have acquired, or in-licensed, a number of assets and we expect to continue to support our pipeline with compounds or products obtained through licensing and acquisitions. Future revenues, profits and cash flows of an acquired company's products, technologies and pipeline candidates may not materialize due to low product uptake, delayed or missed pipeline opportunities,  the  inability  to  capture  expected  synergies  resulting  from  cost  savings  and  avoidance,  increased competition, safety concerns, regulatory issues, supply chain problems or other factors beyond our control. Substantial difficulties,  costs  and  delays  could  result  from  integrating  our  acquisitions,  including  for  (i)  R&amp;D,  manufacturing, distribution,  sales,  marketing,  promotion  and  information  technology  activities;  (ii)  policies,  procedures,  processes, controls and compliance; and (iii) tax considerations. Where we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities, such as in connection with a joint venture or acquisition, the value of those  securities  will  fluctuate  and  may  depreciate  in  value.  We  may  not  control  the  company  in  which  we  acquire securities,  such  as  in  connection  with  a  collaborative  arrangement,  and  as  a  result,  we  will  have  limited  ability  to determine its management, operational decisions, internal controls and compliance and other policies, which can result in additional financial and reputational risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets, and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. Our divestitures also may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, continued supply and services arrangements, or potential litigation, following the transaction. Under these arrangements, nonperformance by us could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition or reputation. In particular, we divested Otezla* in connection with obtaining regulatory approval for our acquisition of Celgene. If the FTC determines that we violated the consent order that we agreed to in connection with the divestiture, the FTC may seek a civil penalty and our reputation may be adversely affected.\n\nWe might also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our earnings. The value allocated to certain of our assets could be substantially impaired due to a number of factors beyond our control. New or revised accounting standards, rules and interpretations could result in changes to the recognition of income and expense that may materially and adversely affect our financial results.\n\nIf the execution or implementation of acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful, it could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Moreover, due to the substantial amount of debt that we incurred to finance the cash portion of the Celgene and MyoKardia acquisitions, there can be no assurance of when we will be able to expand our business development capacity. Although we are committed to reducing our debt, pursuing strategic transaction opportunities in future may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, and could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings.\n\n## Failure  to  attract  and  retain  highly  qualified  workforce  could  affect  our  ability  to  successfully  develop  and commercialize products.\n\nOur success is largely dependent on our continued ability to (i) attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management workforce, including people with expertise in clinical R&amp;D, governmental regulation and commercialization, and  (ii)  in  connection  with  our  Celgene  acquisition,  integrate  two  unique  corporate  cultures  and  maintain  employee morale. We are facing increasing competition for a limited pool of qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and  biotechnology  companies,  universities,  government  entities,  research  institutions,  companies  seeking  to  enter  the healthcare space, and companies in other industries. We cannot be sure that we will be able to retain quality talent or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.\n\n## Market, Liquidity and Credit Risks\n\nOur significant additional indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the Celgene and MyoKardia acquisitions could have negative consequences.\n\nOur acquisitions of Celgene and MyoKardia increased the amount of our debt resulting in additional interest expense. This  could  reduce  our  financial  flexibility  to  continue  capital  investments,  develop  new  products  and  declare  future dividends.",

Upon completion of the transaction, AbbVie received net cash proceeds of $215 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $172 million which was recorded in other operating income in the consolidated statement of earnings in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Other Arrangements\n\nIn addition to the significant arrangements described above, AbbVie entered into several other arrangements resulting in charges related to upfront payments of $975 million in 2024, $582 million in 2023 and $315 million in 2022. In connection with the other individually insignificant early-stage arrangements entered into in 2024, AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $10.1 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense also included development milestones of $130 million in 2024, $196 million in 2023 and $252 million in 2022.\n\n## Note 6 Collaborations\n\nThe company has ongoing transactions with other entities through collaboration agreements. The following represent the significant collaboration agreements impacting 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.\n\nIn December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of Imbruvica, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and certain compounds structurally related to Imbruvica, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States.\n\nThe collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize Imbruvica outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs.\n\nIn the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of Imbruvica are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line i tems, net of Janssen's share.\n\nOutside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize Imbruvica. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and l osses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Tmunity\n\nIn February 2023, we closed an agreement to acquire Tmunity Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tmunity'), a clinical-stage, private biotechnology company focused on nextgeneration chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-therapies and technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired all outstanding shares of Tmunity other than those already owned by Gilead for approximately $300 million in cash consideration. As a result, Tmunity became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded a $244 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2023. The remaining purchase price related to various other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, consisting primarily of deferred tax assets. Under the agreement, the former shareholders of Tmunity and the University of Pennsylvania are eligible to receive a mix of up to approximately $1.0 billion in potential future payments upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, as well as royalty payments on sales, with the first $25 million of milestones charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses in 2023 and paid in January 2024. In 2024, we paid an additional $47 million for development milestones met, which was charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## MiroBio\n\nIn September 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of MiroBio Ltd. ('MiroBio'), a privately-held U.K.-based biotechnology company focused on restoring immune balance with agonists targeting immune inhibitory receptors, for $414 million in cash. As a result, MiroBio became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded a $389 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2022. The remaining purchase price related to various other assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\n## 7.    COLLABORATIONS AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWe enter into licensing and strategic collaborations and other similar arrangements with third parties for the research, development and commercialization of certain products and product candidates. The collaborations involve two or more parties who are active participants in the operating activities of the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the commercial success of the activities. The financial terms of these arrangements may include nonrefundable upfront payments, expense reimbursements, payments by us for options to acquire certain rights, contingent obligations by us for potential development and  regulatory  milestone  payments  and/or  sales-based  milestone  payments,  royalty  payments,  revenue  or  profit-sharing  arrangements  and  cost-sharing arrangements.  Certain  payments  are  contingent  upon  the  occurrence  of  various  future  events  that  have  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty.  Development  milestone payments are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred. Regulatory milestone payments are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to Cost of goods sold over the term of the respective collaboration arrangement. In conjunction with these arrangements, we occasionally purchase shares of the collaboration partner and record such equity investments in either Prepaid and other current assets or Other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, generally depending on marketability and whether the securities are subject to lock-up provisions.",

          "chunk_text": "We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that hav e a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to hav e a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, rev enues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in dev elopment and enter into research and dev elopment arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future ev ents linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achiev ement of an important point in the dev elopment life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approv al for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achiev ement of certain sales lev els). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the ev ent that regulatory approv al for marketing is obtained.\n\nIndiv idually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. Howev er, if milestones for multiple products cov ered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectiv ely, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often giv e us the discretion to unilaterally terminate dev elopment of the product, which would allow us to av oid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease dev elopment if the compound successfully achiev es milestone objectiv es. We v iew these payments as positiv e because they signify that the product is successfully mov ing through dev elopment and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.\n\n## APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjectiv e and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any giv en indiv idual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could dev elop different estimates. We believ e that, giv en current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adv erse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates hav e been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\n\n## Background and Uncertainties\n\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product rev enue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, prov isions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on rev enue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\n\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receiv e under these types of contracts.",

      "answer": "Abbott (ABT) reported excess tax benefits of $22 million in 2023 from share-based compensation, a decline from $43 million in 2022 and $145 million in 2021. Danaher (DHR) noted that excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation contributed to a lower effective tax rate compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate, particularly in 2023. Eli Lilly (LLY) included excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as part of its tax disclosures, though without specific dollar figures, indicating it as a recurring component of its tax strategy. The differences suggest that while all three companies benefit from stock-based compensation-related tax advantages, the magnitude and trend vary, reflecting distinct compensation practices and tax planning approaches.",

Bristol-Myers Squibb emphasizes the use of independent third-party valuation firms and discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets, highlighting a rigorous and assumption-driven approach. Pfizer provides detailed quantitative disclosures, showing a gross carrying amount of $122,961 million in identifiable intangible assets as of December 31, 2024, with net identifiable intangible assets totaling $55,411 million, reflecting a mature and well-documented asset portfolio. Together, these approaches reveal differing emphases: AbbVie focuses on pro forma adjustments post-acquisition, BMY on valuation rigor, and Pfizer on transparency and asset scale.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments\n\nOther GTN sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-U.S. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. to a lesser extent. The non-U.S. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.\n\nEstimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loss of market exclusivity. Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.\n\n## Use of information from external sources\n\nInformation from external sources is used to estimate GTN adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers is based on the projected prescription demandbased sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.\n\nWe have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.\n\n## Acquisition and Intangible Assets Valuations\n\nWe make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations. If it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets. We evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities and assets. If the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business.\n\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Ex cess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Estimating fair value requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions.\n\nIn transactions accounted for as acquisitions of assets, no goodwill is recorded and contingent consideration, such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, generally is not recognized at the acquisition date. In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to IPRD projects at the acquisition date are ex pensed unless there is an alternative future use. In addition, product development milestones are ex pensed upon achievement.\n\nWe have identifiable intangible assets that are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. G enerally, we engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. The fair value of these assets is estimated using discounted cash flow models. These models required the use of the following significant estimates and assumptions among others:",

      "question": "How do CVS, DHR, and PFE differ in their weighted-average remaining contractual term for outstanding stock options, and what might these differences suggest about their respective equity compensation strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "CVS reports a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 5.21 years for its outstanding stock options as of the end of 2023, DHR reports a term of 6 years for its outstanding options, and PFE reports a significantly shorter term of 1.7 years for its outstanding options. These differences suggest varying approaches to equity compensation: CVS maintains a mid-range term, potentially balancing long-term retention and performance incentives; DHR's longer term may emphasize long-horizon incentives, possibly to retain talent over extended periods; and PFE's shorter term may reflect a more immediate vesting schedule or a reset in compensation strategy post-2023. The variation in contractual terms across these healthcare firms could reflect differing corporate philosophies, executive retention strategies, or responses to market dynamics.",

Although the equity investment provides the Company with the ability to exercise significant influence over Mozarc, the Company has elected the fair value option to account for this equity investment. The Company believes the fair value option best reflects the economics of the underlying transaction.\n\nUnder the fair value option, changes in the fair value of the investment are recognized through earnings each reporting period in other non-operating income, net in the consolidated statements of income.  During the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024, the  Company recognized a loss of $220 million, primarily driven by the timing of anticipated product launches, historical financial results, and projections of future cash flows.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the Mozarc investment for which the fair value option has been elected:\n\n",

      "answer": "DHR highlights that increased FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests has added to the cost of commercialization and subjected them to additional regulatory requirements. LLY notes that new or changing legal and regulatory requirements have led to increased compliance, legal, and operational costs. MDT states that new laws or regulations related to climate change and environmental compliance could result in increased operational and compliance burdens and costs. Collectively, this reveals that while all three companies face rising compliance costs, the nature and regulatory domains of these pressures differ\u2014ranging from product commercialization to climate and ESG-related obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DHR \u2192 Increased Compliance Costs: DHR specifically mentions that expanded FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests has delayed and added to the cost of commercialization, indicating a direct link between regulatory evolution and increased compliance costs.",
        "Hop 2: LLY \u2192 Increased Compliance Costs: LLY states that new or changing legal or regulatory requirements have led to increased compliance, legal, and expenses, showing that evolving laws are directly affecting their cost structure.",
        "Hop 3: MDT \u2192 Increased Compliance Costs: MDT indicates that new laws or regulations related to climate change and environmental compliance could increase operational and compliance burdens and costs, pointing to a broader regulatory landscape impacting their business."

There can be no assurance that our liabilities in connection with current and future litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adv ersely affect our financial statements and business. However, based on our experience, information and applicable law as of the date of this Annual Report, we do not believ e that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserv es as of December 31, 2024 will hav e a material effect on our business or financial statements.\n\nFrom time to time, we become aware through our internal audits and other internal control procedures, employees or other parties of possible compliance matters, such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting, internal controls, financial reporting, auditing or ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws. When we become aware of such possible compliance matters, we inv estigate internally and take what we believ e to be appropriate correctiv e action. Internal inv estigations can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal or regulatory proceedings against us and adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nCertain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nCertain of our products are medical dev ices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by other federal and state gov ernmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions, by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations gov erning hazardous materials and drugs-of-abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). The global healthcare regulatory env ironment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Sev eral countries that did not hav e regulatory requirements for medical dev ices hav e established such requirements in recent years, and other countries hav e expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. For example, expanded FDA regulation of laboratory-dev eloped tests (i.e., diagnostic assays dev eloped and produced by clinical laboratories) may delay and add to the cost of commercialization of these products, as well as subject us to additional regulatory requirements. Please see 'Item 1. Business-Regulatory Matters' for more information. Failure to meet these requirements can adv ersely impact our business and financial statements in the applicable geographies.\n\nTo v arying degrees, these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations gov erning the dev elopment, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surv eillance of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approv als for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approv al it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approv als will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approv als could change ov er time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Ev en after initial regulatory clearance or approv al, we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities, and when safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as prov iding additional warnings on the product's label or narrowing its approv ed intended use, which could reduce the product's market acceptance. We are also subject to v arious laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and dev elopment, pricing and sales and marketing practices, the priv acy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards, including the federal regulations described in 'Item 1. Business-Regulatory Matters.'\n\nGovernment authorities hav e in the past and may in the future conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approv als before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other v iolations of laws or regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observ ations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceiv ed efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adv erse ev ents with respect to our products (ev en after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfav orable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observ ations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, fines, expenses, injunctions, civ il penalties, criminal penalties, consent decrees, administrativ e detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, refusal of the gov ernment to grant 510(k) clearance, suspension or withdrawal of approv als, pre-market notification rescissions and other adv erse effects referenced under the risk factor titled 'Our businesses are subject to extensiv e regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adv ersely affect our business and financial statements.' Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, ev en if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us, our business may be impaired. Ensuring that our operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also inv olv es substantial costs.",

          "chunk_text": "around excipients, potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and chemicals important to pharmaceutical manufacturing, in some cases lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in new product approv als or line extensions or supplemental approv als of current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which adv ersely affects our business. Regulatory ov ersight of the pharmaceutical industry entails judgment and interpretation, which can result in v arying interpretations of laws and regulations by health and other authorities. In addition, changing political leadership, including the new presidential administration and regulatory leadership in the U.S., may propose, enact, or pursue policy, regulatory, and enforcement changes that create additional uncertainty for our business.\n\nRegulatory compliance and processes in jurisdictions outside the U.S. may be particularly unpredictable and result in additional costs, uncertainties, and risks. U.S. and foreign gov ernmental authorities are activ ely promulgating additional regulations and guidance that impact many aspects of our operations. These regulations are in some cases adv anced with short notice. New regulations may undermine our ability to achiev e business objectiv es, may be costly to implement, may prov ide only limited time for compliance, may change accounting and reporting standards, and may carry significant penalties for non-compliance. See Item 1, \"Business-Gov ernment Regulation of Our Operations and Products,\" for more details.\n\nWe rely on the FDA and other regulatory bodies for appropriate ov ersight, administration and enforcement across our industry, anyone marketing or purporting to market medicines, and public health. Ov ersight, administrativ e, and enforcement changes, delays, inconsistencies, lapses, and failures could materiality impact our business and reputation. See Item 1, \"Business-Gov ernment Regulation of Our Operations and Products,\" for additional information on regulatory risks, including as related to counterfeit, misbranded, adulterated, and compounded medicines.\n\nFurthermore, there is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislativ e bodies on legislation and policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, sustainability, human rights and related due diligence, workforce matters, and disclosure regarding the foregoing, many of which may be ambiguous, inconsistent, dynamic or conflicting. We have experienced increased compliance costs, legal costs, and expenses related to such new or changing legal or regulatory requirements. Moreover, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements requires us to dev ote time and attention, which may be substantial, to these matters. In addition, we may still be subject to penalties or potential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices.\n\nAdditionally, there is increased attention from the media, stockholders, activ ists, political leadership, regulatory authorities, and other stakeholders on climate, social, and other sustainability matters. The perception that we or others in our industry or supply chain hav e failed to act in an appropriate manner, whether or not v alid, results in publicity that can negativ ely affect our business, brand, and reputation, as well as result in increased scrutiny from political leadership, legislators and regulatory authorities. For example, negativ e perception of inclusion initiativ es, whether due to a perceiv ed ov er- or under-pursuit of such initiativ es, may result in issues hiring or retaining employees, as well as potential inv estigations, enforcement actions, litigation, reputational harm, or other adv erse impacts. Moreov er, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals, initiativ es, and commitments, including on climate, social, and other sustainability matters. Our ability to achiev e any of these stated goals, targets or objectiv es is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside our control. Examples of such factors include ev olv ing regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements, and the av ailability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other goals. If we fail to achiev e, are perceiv ed to hav e failed or been delayed in achiev ing, or improperly report our progress toward achiev ing these goals, initiativ es, and commitments, it could negativ ely affect our reputation, brand, or inv estor confidence, and expose us to inv estigations, enforcement actions and litigation. Conv ersely, our pursuit or achiev ement of such goals, initiativ es, and commitments may not be v iewed fav orably by certain stakeholders and could increase scrutiny of our business, negativ ely affect our reputation, or expose us to inv estigations, enforcement actions and litigation.",

We maintain various controls aligned with legal requirements to prevent and prohibit improper practices, including policies, programs, and training for our employees and third party intermediaries acting on our behalf. However, existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. In addition, regulators could seek to hold us liable for conduct committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any alleged  or  actual  violations  of  these  regulations  may  subject  us  to  government  scrutiny,  criminal  or  civil  sanctions  and  other  liabilities,  including  ex clusion  from government contracting, and could disrupt our business, adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\n## Laws and regulations governing international business operations could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administer certain  laws  and  regulations  that  restrict  U.S.  persons  and,  in  some  instances,  non-U.S.  persons,  in  conducting  activities,  transacting  business  with,  or  making investments in, certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions or export restrictions. Our international operations subject us to  these  laws  and  regulations,  which  are  complex ,  restrict  our  business  dealings  with  certain  countries,  governments,  entities,  and  individuals,  and  are  constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations.\n\nFrom time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions, including Iran, Syria, Cuba, and the region of Crimea, as well as Russia and Belarus. Certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices, and may provide related services, to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries or regions. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. V iolations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of ex port privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, such regulations may impact our ability to continue operations in certain countries and require additional licenses which we may not be able to obtain or maintain. There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from  violating  these  regulations  in  every  transaction  in  which  we  may  engage,  and  such  a  violation  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  business,  results  of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\n## Climate  change,  or  legal,  regulatory  or  market  measures  to  address  climate  change  may  materially  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and  business operations.\n\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere presents risks to our current and future operations. We face current and long-term operational risks and have in the past experienced business interruptions from severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, extreme temperatures, wildfires or flooding. Such severe weather events caused by or related to climate change or other conditions caused by natural disasters have in the past and could in the future increase our operational costs, pose physical risks to our facilities and adversely impact our supply chain, including: manufacturing and distribution networks, the availability and cost of raw materials and components, energy supply, transportation, or other inputs necessary for the operation of our business. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Although it is difficult to predict and adequately prepare to meet the challenges to our business posed by climate change, concerns over climate change also could result in new laws or regulations that are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, and we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations as well as adverse impacts on raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products.\n\n## We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation.\n\nWe are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, and emissions or discharges into the land, air or water. We are further subject to numerous laws and regulations concerning, among other things, chemical constituents in medical products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for medical devices. Our operations and those of certain third-party suppliers involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations, primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes. If we or our suppliers violate these environmental laws and regulations, facilities could be shut down and violators could be fined, or otherwise sanctioned. New laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.\n\n## We are subject to risks related to our environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and initiatives.\n\nThere is continued focus from our stakeholders, as well as regulatory authorities in the U.S., E.U. and other global jurisdictions in which we operate, on ESG  practices and disclosure. If we do not succeed in meeting or are perceived as not meeting, stated goals and objectives, in any number of ESG  matters, such as environmental stewardship, ID&amp;E initiatives, supply chain practices, good corporate governance,",

      "question": "How do BMY, GILD, and PFE each estimate and account for cash discounts in their revenue recognition practices, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to short-term payment incentives in the pharmaceutical supply chain?",
      "answer": "BMY estimates GTN adjustments, including cash discounts, based on significant judgment around legal interpretations, historical experience, payer mix, and processing lags, with cash discounts typically settled through credits within one month. GILD specifically calls out cash discounts as a separate gross-to-net deduction and estimates them based on contractual terms, historical customer payment patterns, and expectations regarding future payment behavior. PFE records cash discounts as part of its broader sales incentives, which are estimated based on historical experience with similar incentive programs to predict customer behavior. While all three companies recognize cash discounts as a reduction to revenue, BMY embeds them within a broader GTN framework, GILD isolates them as a distinct category with forward-looking expectations, and PFE integrates them into a general incentive estimation model, reflecting varying degrees of specificity and forward visibility into short-term payment incentives.",

The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from singleemployer pension plans in the following respects: (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and (iii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the applicable plan, which is referred to as a withdrawal liability.\n\nNone of the multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates are individually significant to the Company. The Company's contributions to multiemployer pension plans were $19 million, $19 million and $18 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Other Postretirement Benefits\n\nThe Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees who meet eligibility requirements. The Company's funding policy is generally to pay covered expenses as they are incurred. For retiree medical plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rates. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's other postretirement benefits had an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $207 million and $226 million, respectively. Net periodic benefit costs related to these other postretirement benefits were $4 million, $12 million and $7 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.",

UNH directly ties its Cost of Products Sold to pharmaceutical dispensing costs, rebate accruals, and pharmacy network operations, revealing a more transactional and service-oriented cost structure compared to the product-centric models of ABBV and BMY.

For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nThe Company's cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company's transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments are measured at fair value, with certain exceptions where the Company has elected to measure investments with unobservable inputs at cost, subject to fair value adjustments upon an impairment or a transaction of the same or similar security. Changes in fair value of equity investments are recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.\n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security's amortized cost, the ex tent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality.\n\n## Assets Under Management\n\nIn July 2024, the Company amended its Medicare Supplement Program with a membership organization (the Medicare Supplement Program). The amendments provide the Company the right to use a trade name and other intellectual property in marketing efforts for Medicare Supplement offerings. Amounts previously reported as assets under management are now included within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet based upon their classification.\n\nFor periods prior to the amended Medicare Supplement Program, the Company excluded the effects of certain balance sheet amounts in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while these effects are included for periods after the amendments.\n\n## Other Current Receivables\n\nOther current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues consist primarily of royalty income and corporate partner revenues. Royalties from licensees are based on thirdparty sales of licensed products and are recorded when the related third-party product sale occurs. Royalty income is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends. Corporate partner revenues are composed mainly of license fees and milestones earned and our share of commercial profits generated from collaborations. See Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations, discussed below.\n\n## Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  enter  into  arrangements  for  the  R&amp;D,  manufacture  and/or  commercialization  of  products  and  product candidates.  Such  arrangements  may  require  us  to  deliver  various  rights,  services  and/or  goods,  including  intellectual  property rights/licenses, R&amp;D services, manufacturing services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally  provide  for  consideration  to  Amgen  in  the  form  of  nonrefundable,  upfront  license  fees;  development  and  commercialperformance milestone payments; royalty payments; and/or profit sharing.\n\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what  the  selling  price  would  be  if  the  deliverable  was  regularly  sold  by  us  on  a  stand-alone  basis  or  by  using  an  adjusted  market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\n\nThe consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We utilize the sales- and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nR&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems' costs; and amortization of acquired technology used in R&amp;D with alternative future uses. R&amp;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated  with  third-party  R&amp;D  arrangements,  including  upfront  fees  and  milestones  paid  to  third  parties  in  connection  with technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&amp;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 8, Collaborations.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSG&amp;A  costs  are  primarily  composed  of  salaries,  benefits  and  other  staff-related  costs  associated  with  sales  and  marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee on Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $843 million, $962 million and $789 million during the years ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  SG&amp;A  expenses  also  include  costs  and  cost  recoveries  associated  with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&amp;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 8, Collaborations.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt  inception  of  a  contract,  we  determine  whether  an  arrangement  is  or  contains  a  lease.  For  all  leases,  we  determine  the classification as either operating or financing. Operating leases are included in Other noncurrent assets, Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. For example, in May 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court voted to invalidate Article 40 of Brazil's Patent Law, which guaranteed a minimum 10-year patent term from patent grant, and to give retroactive effect to such decision. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term made by parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area.\n\nFurther, legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governments could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from enforcing intellectual property related to our products. Discussions are ongoing at the WTO regarding the role of intellectual property in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. This includes a proposal that would release WTO members from their obligation under WTO-TRIPS to grant and enforce various types of intellectual property protection on health products and technology in relation to the prevention, containment or treatment of COVID-19. In May 2021 and again in November 2021, the Biden Administration called on countries to waive intellectual property protections on COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country, its enforcement practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country's intellectual property framework (e.g., laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license). In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are employing aggressive strategies, such as 'at risk' launches that challenge our patent rights. Most of the suits involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products, uses, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claims may also be brought as counterclaims to actions we bring to enforce our patents. We are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry. We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents or a competitors' patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For additional information, including information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16A1 . Further, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationship with us. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third-party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\n\n## THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS\n\nA properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model. We are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other companies, but the patent granting process is imperfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were improperly granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges may not always be successful.\n\nPart of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which may involve litigation, associated costs and time delays, and may ultimately not be successful. These opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In some circumstances we may take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a 'first-to-market' or early market position for our products.\n\nThird parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consuming to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant royalty payments or damages.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n19",

      "question": "How do Abbott (ABT), Gilead (GILD), and Pfizer (PFE) each quantify or describe the impact of cash discounts on their revenue recognition processes, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to estimating short-term sales deductions?",
      "answer": "Abbott (ABT) reports that cash discounts amounted to $263 million, $280 million, and $268 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and notes that these discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, allowing for reliable estimation. Gilead (GILD) states that it estimates cash discounts based on contractual terms, historical customer payment patterns, and expectations regarding future payment behavior, integrating these into gross-to-net deductions. Pfizer (PFE) includes cash discounts among its sales allowances and accruals, estimating them based on historical experience with similar incentive programs to predict customer behavior, particularly in relation to sales incentives offered. Collectively, this reveals that while all three companies treat cash discounts as a predictable and short-term deduction, Abbott emphasizes rapid feedback for accuracy, Gilead focuses on behavioral modeling, and Pfizer aligns estimation with broader incentive program tracking.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABT \u2192 Cash Discounts: Abbott reports specific dollar amounts for cash discounts over three years and notes their reliable estimation due to short timeframes (15\u201330 days).",
        "Hop 2: GILD \u2192 Cash Discounts: Gilead explains that cash discounts are estimated using contractual terms, historical data, and forward-looking expectations about customer payments, integrated into gross-to-net deductions.",

      "answer": "AbbVie is advancing its oncology portfolio with a focus on Venclexta, Epkinly, and Elahere, supported by the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and the proposed Cerevel Therapeutics deal, aiming to strengthen its pipeline and manage competitive challenges in oncology. Bristol-Myers Squibb is expanding its targeted oncology portfolio through the acquisitions of Karuna, RayzeBio, Mirati, and Turning Point, positioning itself as a leader in oncology and neuroscience. Pfizer significantly bolstered its oncology presence by acquiring Seagen in December 2023, gaining access to Padcev, Adcetris, Tukysa, and Tivdak, and restructured its commercial operations to create a dedicated Pfizer Oncology Division. Collectively, these moves reflect distinct strategic approaches: AbbVie focuses on diversification and pipeline enhancement, BMS on targeted oncology leadership, and Pfizer on integration and operational restructuring to scale its oncology footprint.",

      "answer": "DHR reports 2.0 million exercisable shares at an average exercise price of $69.42 for the lowest price range, indicating a relatively tight clustering of exercised options. GILD shows 7.4 million exercisable shares with a lower average exercise price of $68.72, suggesting broader participation or a more mature equity compensation program. PFE, on the other hand, has 17.4 million exercisable shares at an average exercise price of $33.12, which is significantly lower than both DHR and GILD, potentially reflecting a different strategy or earlier-stage vesting cycle. The differences in exercisable share counts and average exercise prices suggest varying stages of equity compensation maturity and employee participation across the three companies.",

The Company recognizes the compensation expense over the requisite service period (which is generally the vesting period but may be shorter than the vesting period if the employee becomes retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period). The fair value for RSU awards was calculated using the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the fact that RSUs do not accrue dividends. The fair value of the PSU awards was calculated using a Monte Carlo pricing model. The fair value of the options granted was calculated using a Black-Scholes Merton option pricing model ('Black-Scholes').\n\nThe following summarizes the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to value options granted during the years ended December 31:\n\n",

RSU shares are accounted for at fair value based upon the closing stock price on the date of grant. The corresponding expense is amortized over the vesting period, typically three years. The fair values of RSU awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $196.30, $135.42, and $108.43, respectively. The number of shares ultimately issued for the RSU program remains constant with the exception of forfeitures. Pursuant to this program, 0.7 million, 1.1 million, and 1.5 million shares were granted and approximately 0.6 million, 0.6 million, and 0.8 million shares were issued during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Approximately 0.9 million shares are expected to be issued in 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs was $161.4 million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of 25 months.\n\n## Note 13: Shareholders' Equity\n\nIn 2021, 2020, and 2019, we repurchased $1.25 billion, $500.0 million, and $4.40 billion, respectively, of shares associated with our share repurchase programs.\n\nIn 2021, we repurchased $1.00 billion of shares, which completed our $8.00 billion share repurchase program authorized in June 2018. Additionally, our board authorized a $5.00 billion share repurchase program in May 2021. In 2021, we repurchased $250.0 million of shares under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, we had $4.75 billion remaining under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program.\n\nWe have 5.0 million authorized shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no preferred stock was issued.\n\nWe have an employee benefit trust that held 50.0 million shares of our common stock at both December 31, 2021 and 2020, to provide a source of funds to assist us in meeting our obligations under various employee benefit plans. The cost basis of the shares held in the trust was $3.01 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020, and is shown as a reduction of shareholders' equity. Any dividend transactions between us and the trust are eliminated. Stock held by the trust is not considered outstanding in the computation of EPS. The assets of the trust were not used to fund any of our obligations under these employee benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n## Note 14: Income Taxes\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred taxes related to global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) are also recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences.\n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position, based on its technical merits, will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.",

Danaher attributes net actuarial gains in 2021 to increases in discount rates compared to 2020, while 2020 net losses were due to decreases in discount rates compared to 2019.

The net actuarial losses in 2020  are  primarily  due  to  the  year-over-year  decline  in  discount  rates  partially  offset  by  the  impact  of  actual  asset returns in excess of expected returns.\n\nThe weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows:\n\n",

Bristol-Myers Squibb reported significant negative impacts on R&D expense, including a $610 million IPRD impairment charge for an investigational compound and a $230 million IPRD impairment for another compound, both reflecting changes in clinical timelines and competitive dynamics. Medtronic, in contrast, consistently invested in R&D, recording $40 million in 2022, $38 million in 2021, and $36 million in 2020, showing a more stable and sustained approach to innovation. This suggests that while Abbott focused on cost optimization, BMY faced major setbacks in its R&D pipeline, and Medtronic maintained steady investment in innovation.",

          "chunk_text": "In  2021,  Abbott  management  approved  plans  to  streamline  operations  in  order  to  reduce  costs  and  improve efficiencies  in  various  Abbott  businesses  including  the  diagnostics,  established  pharmaceuticals  and  nutritional businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $68 million. Approximately $16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $4 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $61 million and primarily represent severance obligations.\n\n## Interest Expense and Interest (Income)\n\nInterest expense, net decreased $10 million in 2021 due to the reduction of interest expense driven by lower interest rates in 2021. The effects of higher cash and short-term investment balances were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates on interest income in 2021. In 2020, interest expense, net decreased $76 million due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in November 2019, the repayment of debt in December 2019 and a lower interest rate environment in 2020.\n\n## Debt Extinguishment Costs\n\nOn December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9% Notes due 2021. Abbott incurred a charge of $63 million related to the early repayment of this debt.\n\n## Other (Income) Expense, net\n\nOther (income) expense, net includes income of approximately $270 million, $205 million and $225 million in 2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively,  related  to  the  non-service  cost  components  of  the  net  periodic  benefit  costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other (income) expense, net also includes a gain on the sale  of  an  equity  method  investment  in  2021  and  equity  investment  impairments  that  totaled  approximately  $115 million in 2020.\n\n## Taxes on Earnings\n\nThe income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 13.9 percent in 2021, 10.0 percent in 2020, and 9.6 percent in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $145 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and approximately $55 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years.\n\nIn 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the  resolution  of  various  tax  positions  related  to  prior  years,  and  approximately  $100  million  in  excess  tax  benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $26 million increase to the transition tax liability associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The $26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.53 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining balance of Abbott's transition tax obligation is approximately $794 million, which will be paid over the next five years as allowed by the TCJA. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2020 reflect the recognition of $24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2019,  taxes  on  earnings  from  continuing  operations  included  approximately  $100  million  in  excess  tax  benefits associated with share-based compensation, an $86 million reduction of the transition tax and $68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. The $86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019.\n\nExclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore,  and  Malta. Abbott  benefits  from  a  combination  of  favorable  statutory  tax  rules,  tax  rulings,  grants,  and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate.\n\n## Research and Development Programs\n\nAbbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development.",

The compound is being  studied  as  a  potential  treatment  for  hematologic  diseases  and  was  acquired  in  the  acquisition  of  Celgene.  The  charge represented a partial  write-down of its carrying value based on the estimated fair value determined using discounted cash flow projections. Additionally, a $230 million IPRD impairment charge was recorded in Research and development expense following a decision  to  discontinue  development  of  an  investigational  compound  in  connection  with  the  prioritization  of  current  pipeline opportunities. The compound was being studied as a potential treatment for fibrotic diseases and was acquired in the acquisition of Celgene.  The  charge  represented  a  full  write-down  based  on  the  estimated  fair  value  determined  using  discounted  cash  flow projections.\n\nIn  2021, Inrebic EU  regulatory  approval  milestones  of  $300  million  were  achieved  resulting  in  a  $385  million  increase  to  the acquired marketed product rights intangible asset, after establishing the applicable deferred tax liability. An impairment charge of $315 million was recognized in Cost of products sold as the carrying value of this asset exceeded the projected undiscounted cash flows of the asset. The charge was equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value using discounted cash flow projections.\n\nIn 2020, a $575 million impairment charge was recorded in Cost of products sold resulting from the lower cash flow projections reflecting  revised  commercial  forecasts  for Inrebic ,  resulting  in  the  full  impairment  of  the  asset.  Additionally,  a  $470  million impairment charge was recorded in Research and development expense following a decision to discontinue the orva-cel program development. Inrebic and orva-cel were obtained in connection with the acquisition of Celgene.\n\n## Note 15. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\n",

      "answer": "Abbott states that cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale and can be reliably estimated due to the short time frame, which allows them to reduce gross sales accordingly. Bristol-Myers Squibb notes that cash discounts are generally around 2% of the invoiced sales price in the U.S. and certain other countries, and are taken by customers within one month, with accounts receivable reduced at the time of sale. Gilead estimates cash discounts based on contractual terms, historical customer payment patterns, and expectations regarding future payment behavior, indicating a forward-looking approach to receivables management. When combined, these approaches show that while all three companies account for cash discounts as a prompt payment incentive, Abbott emphasizes reliability due to short settlement periods, BMY provides a specific percentage and timing benchmark, and Gilead incorporates predictive modeling into its estimation process.",

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n## Note 3 - Revenue (Continued)\n\nRebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income.\n\nOther allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts  are  known  within  15  to  30  days  of  sale,  and  therefore  can  be  reliably  estimated.  Returns  can  be  reliably estimated  because  Abbott's  historical  returns  are  low,  and  because  sales  return  terms  and  other  sales  terms  have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant.\n\nAbbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in  an  amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott  uses  an  expected  cost  plus  a  margin  approach  to  estimate  the  standalone  selling  price  of  each  performance obligation.\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations  that  are  unsatisfied  (or  partially  unsatisfied)  was  approximately  $4  billion  in  the  Diagnostic  Products segment  and  approximately  $435  million  in  the  Medical  Devices  segment. Abbott  expects  to  recognize  revenue  on approximately  60  percent  of  these  remaining  performance  obligations  over  the  next  24  months,  approximately  16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter.\n\nThese performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase  obligations,  extended  warranty  or  service  obligations  related  to  previously  sold  equipment,  and  remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above.\n\n## Assets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\n\nAbbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining  or  renewing  contracts  with  customers  are  incremental  to  obtaining  the  contract.  Abbott  capitalizes  these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from two to ten years. The amounts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were not significant.\n\nAdditionally,  the  cost  of  transmitters  provided  to  customers  that  use  Abbott's  remote  monitoring  service  with respect to certain medical devices are capitalized as contract costs. Capitalized transmitter costs are amortized based on the  timing  of  the  transfer  of  services  to  which  the  assets  relate,  which  typically  ranges  from  eight  to  ten  years. The amounts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were not significant.\n\n## Other Contract Assets and Liabilities\n\nAbbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected.  Contract  assets  primarily  relate  to Abbott's  conditional  right  to  consideration  for  work  completed  but  not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant.",

          "chunk_text": "The following  categories  of  GTN  adjustments  involve  significant  estimates,  judgments  and  information  obtained  from  external sources. Refer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2. Revenue' for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of GTN sales adjustments.\n\n## Charge-backs and cash discounts\n\nOur U.S. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340B Drug Pricing Program,  whereby  pricing  on  products  is  extended  below  wholesaler  list  price  to  participating  entities.  These  entities  purchase products  through  wholesalers  at  the  lower  program  price  and  the  wholesalers  then  charge  us  the  difference  between  their acquisition cost and the lower program price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).\n\nIn  the  U.S.  and  certain  other  countries,  customers  are  offered  cash  discounts  as  an  incentive  for  prompt  payment,  generally approximating 2% of the invoiced sales price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of cash discount at the time of sale and the discount is typically taken by the customer within one month.\n\n## Medicaid and Medicare rebates\n\nOur U.S. business participates in state government Medicaid programs and other qualifying Federal and state government programs requiring  discounts  and  rebates  to  participating  state  and  local  government  entities. All  discounts  and  rebates  provided  through these programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual. Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed Medicaid plans. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability.\n\nRebates  and  discounts  are  offered  to  managed  healthcare  organizations  in  the  U.S.  managing  prescription  drug  programs  and Medicare Advantage  prescription  drug  plans  covering  the  Medicare  Part  D  drug  benefit.  We  also  pay  a  70%  point  of  service discount to the CMS when the Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the coverage gap. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.\n\n## Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments\n\nOther GTN sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-U.S.  countries  as  well  as  rebates  offered  to  managed  healthcare  organizations  in  the  U.S.  to  a  lesser  extent.  The  non-U.S. programs  include  several  different  pricing  schemes  such  as  cost  caps,  volume  discounts,  outcome-based  pricing  schemes  and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.\n\nEstimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loss of market exclusivity. Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.\n\n## Use of information from external sources\n\nInformation from external sources is used to estimate GTN adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers is based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of thirdparty information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and  sell-through  to  customers  and  third-party  market  research  data,  and  our  internal  information.  The  inventory  information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.\n\nWe have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand  and  average  selling  prices.  Our  estimates  are  subject  to  inherent  limitations  of  estimates  that  rely  on  third-party information,  as  certain  third-party  information  was  itself  in  the  form  of  estimates,  and  reflect  other  limitations  including  lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.",

          "chunk_text": "## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Product Sales\n\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when control of the product transfers, generally upon shipment or delivery, to the customer, or in certain cases, upon the corresponding sales by our customer to a third party. The revenues are recognized net of estimated  government  and  other  rebates  and  chargebacks,  cash  discounts  for  prompt  payment,  distributor  fees,  sales  return provisions  and  other  related  deductions.  These  deductions  to  product  sales  are  referred  to  as  gross-to-net  deductions  and  are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. Our payment terms to customers generally range from  30  to  90  days;  however,  payment  terms  differ  by  jurisdiction,  by  customer  and,  in  some  instances,  by  type  of  product. Revenues from product sales, net of gross-to-net deductions, are recorded only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative  revenue  recognized  is  not  probable  of  occurring  when  the  uncertainty  associated  with  gross-to-net  deductions  is subsequently resolved. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers are excluded from product sales. If we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of control and corresponding payment from the customer will be one year or less, we do not adjust the amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\n## Rebates and Chargebacks\n\nGovernment and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts payable to payers and healthcare providers under various programs,  and  may  vary  by  product,  by  payer  and  individual  payer  plans.  Rebates  and  chargebacks  are  based  on  contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, payer and individual payer plans. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price.\n\nRebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, and expected payer mix and discount rates, which require significant estimates and judgment. Additionally, in developing our estimates, we consider: historical and estimated payer mix; statutory discount requirements and contractual terms; historical claims experience and processing time lags; estimated patient population; known market events or trends; market research; channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers; and other pertinent internal or external information. We assess and update our estimates each reporting period to reflect actual claims and other current information.\n\nGovernment and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are generally classified as reductions of Accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Government and other rebates that are payable to third party payers and healthcare providers are recorded in Accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cash Discounts\n\nWe estimate cash discounts based on contractual terms, historical customer payment patterns and our expectations regarding future customer payment patterns.\n\n## Distributor Fees\n\nUnder our inventory management agreements with our significant U.S. wholesalers, we pay the wholesalers a fee primarily for compliance with certain contractually determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels. These distributor fees are based on a contractually determined fixed percentage of sales.\n\n## Allowance for Sales Returns\n\nAllowances  are  made  for  estimated  sales  returns  by  our  customers  and  are  recorded  in  the  period  the  related  revenue  is recognized. We typically permit returns if the product is damaged, defective, or otherwise cannot be used by the customer. In the United States, we typically permit returns six months prior to and up to one year after the product expiration date. Outside the United States, returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\n\nOur estimates of sales returns are based primarily on analysis of our historical product return patterns, industry information reporting the return rates for similar products and contractual agreement terms. We also take into consideration known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product.\n\n## Shipping and Handling\n\nShipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and not considered to be a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues\n\nRoyalty revenue is recognized in the period in which the obligation is satisfied and the corresponding sales by our corporate partners occur.",

BUSINESS.\n\n## General\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (\"we\", the \"Company\", or \"BMS\") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1933 under the name BristolMyers Company, as successor to a New Y ork business started in 1887. In 1989, Bristol-Myers Company changed its name to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company as a result of a merger.\n\nWe operate in one segment engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of biopharmaceutical products on a global basis. Our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. Our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular, neuroscience and other areas where we can also deliver attractive returns for shareholders. Our priorities are to focus on transformational medicines where we have a competitive advantage, drive operational excellence and strategically allocate capital for long-term growth and shareholder returns.  For a further discussion of our strategy initiatives, refer to 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Strategy.' In addition, we expect that our acquisitions  of  Karuna,  RayzeBio  and  Mirati  in  2024  will  allow  us  to  ex pand  in  neuroscience  and  oncology,  and  continue  to  position  us  as  a  leading biopharmaceutical company across our core therapeutic areas.\n\nWe compete with other global research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies and generic drug manufacturers. Our products are sold worldwide, primarily to wholesalers, distributors, specialty pharmacies, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. We have significant manufacturing operations in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe percentage of revenues by significant region/country were as follows:\n\n",

The sales increase was primarily due to growth in oncology , cardiovascular and animal health, partially offset by declines in diabetes, virology (driven largely by lower sales of COVID-19 medication Lagevrio ), immunology (as M erck's marketing rights to these products ended in 2024) and vaccines.\n\nMerck continues to execute value creating business development opportunities focused on innovation to augment its robust internal pipeline with compelling external science. Highlights of 2024 activity include the following:\n\n- Closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize M K-2010 (LM -299), a novel investigational programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/vascular endothelial growth factor (V EGF) bispecific antibody from LaNova M edicines Ltd (LaNova).\n- Closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize  M K-4082 (HS-10535), an investigational preclinical oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist from Hansoh Pharma (Hansoh).\n- Acquired global rights to M K-1045 (formerly CN201), a novel investigational clinical-stage bispecific antibody for the treatment of B-cell associated diseases from Curon Pharmaceutical (Curon).\n- Acquired Eyebiotech Limited (EyeBio), a privately held ophthalmology-focused biotechnology company developing candidates for the prevention and treatment of vision loss.\n\n\u2022\n\nAcquired Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc. (Harpoon), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T-cell engagers designed to harness the power of the body's immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases.\n\nDuring 2024, M erck continued its efforts to address unmet medical needs by launching new products with significant patient benefit, including the U.S. launches of Winrevair , for the treatment of certain adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA H), and Capvaxive, for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Winrevair was also approved in the EU.\n\nThe Company received more than 25 regulatory approvals in major markets in 2024, including the Winrevair and Capvaxive approvals noted above, along  with  numerous  approvals  in  oncology .

A lso in 2024, Welireg was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain von Hippel-Lindau (V HL) disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery . Lynparza, which is being developed in collaboration with A straZeneca PLC (A straZeneca), received approval in China for the treatment of certain adult patients with germline BRCA -mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative high-risk early breast cancer.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory approvals discussed above, the Company advanced its late-stage pipeline with several regulatory submissions.\n\n- MK-1022, patritumab deruxtecan, is a potential first-in-class HER3 directed DX d antibody drug conjugate (A DC), under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated NSCLC previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. In June 2024, the FDA  issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the Biologics License A pplication (BLA ) due to findings pertaining to an inspection of a third-party manufacturing facility . The CRL did not identify any issues with the efficacy or safety data submitted. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DX d) was discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and is",

      "answer": "CVS reports $151 million in long-term debt due in 2025, indicating a relatively low near-term obligation compared to its peers. JNJ has significantly higher 2025 debt obligations at $1,749 million, suggesting greater reliance on debt financing or restructuring activity. MDT's 2025 long-term debt stands at $1,092 million, reflecting a moderate but still substantial near-term liability. Collectively, this variation highlights differing capital structure strategies, with CVS appearing more conservatively leveraged in the short term, JNJ showing higher exposure to near-term refinancing risk, and MDT balancing between the two.",

UNH similarly notes exposure to civil fines through regulatory audits like RADV, and investigations into PBM and pharmacy care services, including potential false claims and beneficiary inducement violations. Together, these disclosures reveal that while all three face civil fine risks, the nature and sources of exposure differ: BMY faces environmental compliance and remediation liabilities, CVS faces operational and consumer protection-related fines, and UNH faces program integrity and regulatory enforcement risks tied to federal health programs.",

      "question": "How do ABBV, DHR, and MDT each reflect their strategic use of acquisitions in their financial disclosures, particularly in terms of cash outflows for business acquisitions (ABBV: $525M in 2021), accounting treatment for acquired businesses (DHR: inclusion of allowance for doubtful accounts and ASU adoption impact), and capital allocation considerations (MDT: emphasis on flexibility to acquire businesses and technology)?",
      "answer": "ABBV discloses a cash outflow of $525 million in 2021 for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, indicating a significant but measured level of M&A activity. DHR references the inclusion of allowance for doubtful accounts and adjustments related to businesses acquired, specifically noting the impact of ASU No. 2016-13, which reflects the accounting and financial reporting complexities of acquisitions. MDT emphasizes its strong financial position and flexibility in capital allocation, explicitly stating that it considers liquidity necessary to fund acquisitions of businesses and technology as part of its strategic planning. Together, these perspectives show that while ABBV actively engages in acquisitions with quantifiable impact, DHR focuses on the accounting implications of such activities, and MDT prioritizes strategic flexibility to pursue M&A as part of long-term growth.",

      "answer": "Abbott evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts by considering aging trends, historical charge-offs, and forward-looking factors such as country risk to determine credit limits and allowances. Amgen reports that a small group of customers accounts for a majority of its net trade receivables, with 70% in 2024, and notes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is not material, despite 26% of receivables being from international markets, primarily in Europe. Pfizer highlights that global economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets, could impact the ability of payors and customers to meet obligations, and it specifically notes the risk that its allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate in the face of geopolitical instability and trade restrictions. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies consider international exposure and customer concentration in their credit risk assessments, they differ in the materiality of their allowances and the emphasis placed on external risk factors.",

As a result of these and other factors, our strategy to grow in em erging m arkets m ay not be successful, and any growth rates in these m arkets m ay not be sustainable. Additionally, local econom ic conditions m ay adversely affect the ability of payors, as well as our distributors, custom ers, suppliers and service providers, to pay for our products, or otherwise to buy necessary inventory or raw m aterials, and to perform  their obligations under agreem ents with us.\n\nGovernm ent financing and econom ic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various m arkets where governm ents take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through health technology assessm ents) or other m eans of cost control. For additional inform ation on governm ent pricing pressures, see the Item 1. Business-Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.\n\nWe continue to m onitor the global trade environm ent and potential trade conflicts, sanctions and im pedim ents that could im pact our business. If trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global econom ic activity, potential im pacts could include declining sales; increased costs; volatility in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investm ents; required increases of our pension funding obligations; increased governm ent cost control efforts; delays or failures in the perform ance of custom ers, suppliers and other third parties on whom  we m ay depend for the perform ance of our business; and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts m ay not be adequate. In addition, issued or future executive orders or other new or changes in laws, regulations or policy regarding tariffs, could have a m aterial adverse effect on our business, earnings and financial guidance. The actual im pact of the new tariffs on our business is subject to a num ber of factors including, but not lim ited to, restrictions on trade, the effective date and duration of such tariffs, countries included in the scope of tariffs, changes to am ounts of tariffs, and potential retaliatory tariffs im posed by other countries.\n\nWe operate in m any countries and transact in m any different currencies. C hanges in the value of those currencies relative to the U .S. dollar, or high inflation or deflation in those countries, can im pact our revenues, costs and expenses and our financial guidance. Significant portions of our revenues, costs and expenses, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to exchange rate changes. In 2024, 39% of our total revenues were derived from  international operations, including 19% from  E urope and 13% from  C hina, Japan and the rest of the Asia P acific region. F uture changes in exchange rates or econom ic conditions and the im pact they m ay have on our results of operations, financial condition or business are difficult to predict. F or additional inform ation about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within M D &amp;A.\n\nI n addition, our borrowing, pension benefit and postretirem ent benefit obligations and interest-bearing investm ents are subject to risk from  changes in interest and exchange rates. T he risks related to interest-bearing investm ents and borrowings and the m easures we have taken to help contain them  are discussed in the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within M D &amp;A and Note 7E . F or additional details on critical accounting estim ates and assum ptions for our benefit plans, see the Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions-Benefit Plans section within M D &amp;A and Note 11 .\n\n## PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, SALE S AND MARKE TING RISKS\n\nWe could encounter difficulties, delays or inefficiencies in our supply chain, product m anufacturing and distribution networks, as well as sales or m arketing, due to regulatory actions, shut-downs, work stoppages or strikes, approval delays, withdrawals, recalls, penalties, supply disruptions, shortages or stock-outs at our facilities or third-party facilities that we rely on, reputational harm , the im pact to our facilities due to health pandem ics or natural or m an-m ade disasters, including as a result of clim ate change, product liability or unanticipated costs. E xam ples of such difficulties or delays include the inability to increase or m aintain production capacity com m ensurate with dem and; challenges related to com ponent m aterials to m aintain supply and/or appropriate quality standards throughout our supply network and/or com ply with applicable regulations; inability to supply certain products due to voluntary product recalls or withdrawals, including, for exam ple, our voluntary withdrawal of all lots of O xbryta in all m arkets where it is approved; and supply chain disruptions at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor. In addition, we engage contract m anufacturers, and, from  tim e to tim e, our contract m anufacturers m ay face difficulties or are unable to m anufacture our products at the necessary quantity or quality levels.\n\nRegulatory agencies periodically inspect our m anufacturing facilities, as well as third-party facilities that we rely on, to evaluate com pliance with cG M P  or other applicable requirem ents. F ailure to com ply with these requirem ents m ay subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of m anufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions, debarm ent, product recalls, delays or denials of product approvals, im port bans or denials of im port certifications. In response to requests from  various regulatory authorities, m anufacturers across the pharm aceutical industry, including P fizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or form ation of nitrosam ines and we are actively engaging with regulatory authorities on this topic. If nitrosam ines are detected above certain levels in our products, this m ay lead to m arket action for such products. F or exam ple, in 2021, P fizer recalled all lots of C hantix due to the presence of a nitrosam ine, N -nitroso-varenicline, at or above the acceptable intake lim its com m unicated by various regulatory authorities. R egulatory authorities have since issued updated guidance on nitrosam ine acceptable intake levels. W ith this guidance, which included an updated intake level for N -nitroso-varenicline, we have started m aking regulatory subm issions to potentially enable C hantix to return to m arket in the U .S. and in certain international m arkets.\n\nSee the Overview  of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook -Our Operating Environment section within M D &amp;A.\n\n## COLLABORATIONS AND OTHE R RE LATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIE S\n\nWe depend on third-party collaborators, service providers, and others in the research, developm ent, m anufacturing and com m ercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into JVs and other business developm ent transactions. To achieve expected longer-term  benefits, we m ay m ake substantial upfront paym ents as part of these transactions, which m ay negatively im pact our earnings or cash flows. W e rely heavily on these parties for m ultiple aspects of our drug developm ent, m anufacturing and commercialization activities, but we do not control m any aspects of those activities. W e also outsource certain services, including activities related to transaction processing, accounting, IT, m anufacturing, clinical trial recruitm ent and execution, clinical lab services, non-clinical research, safety services, integrated facilities\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n17",

      "answer": "DHR reports $415 million in 'Other long-term assets' in 2024, showing a year-over-year increase from $291 million, suggesting growing investment in non-current assets likely tied to long-term strategic initiatives. GILD discloses $10 million in 'Other long-term assets' related to derivative instruments, indicating a limited exposure in this category, primarily associated with foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. UNH reports $439 million in 'Other long-term assets' within its Brazil Disposition segment, which may reflect strategic positioning or divestiture-related assets. The variation in scale and context of these assets across the three companies highlights differing capital structures and strategic focuses within the healthcare sector, with DHR and UNH showing more substantial long-term asset positions compared to GILD\u2019s minimal exposure.",

        "Hop 2: GILD \u2192 Other long-term assets: GILD reports only $10 million in 'Other long-term assets' in the context of derivative instruments, specifically tied to hedging activities, showing minimal exposure compared to the other two firms.",

      "answer": "ABBV capitalizes IPR&D acquired in business combinations and evaluates it based on discounted cash flow models incorporating assumptions such as timing of future cash flows, risk, and cost of capital. MRK reports a net IPR&D value of $430 million in 2024, down significantly from $6,816 million in 2023, indicating either asset impairments or successful transitions of projects to commercialization. PFE initially recognized $20.8 billion in IPR&D from an acquisition, later adjusted down by $900 million, showing a dynamic reassessment of the value of early-stage projects post-acquisition. Collectively, these disclosures reflect differing stages and scales of IPR&D activity, with ABBV emphasizing valuation methodology, MRK showing a sharp decline in IPR&D value year-over-year, and PFE highlighting the volatility of initial IPR&D estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2024 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2025. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2025 by $109 million.\n\nThe health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2024 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2025.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional i nformation. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a l ower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.\n\n## Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. In-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an\n\n## 47 | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How do BMY, DHR, and PFE each characterize the financial and strategic challenges associated with R&D costs, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to managing innovation risk?",
      "answer": "BMY distinguishes its R&D costs by recognizing them over service periods in contracts and adjusting based on actual effort and incurred costs, while also presenting R&D expenses net of reimbursements from alliance partners. This suggests a collaborative and phased investment model that aligns spending with partner contributions. In contrast, DHR highlights that acquisitions, investments, and strategic relationships often lead to significant financial risks, including unexpected costs, integration challenges, and unrealized synergies, which can negatively impact R&D outcomes and financial performance. DHR\u2019s perspective implies a reliance on external innovation through M&A, which introduces volatility in managing R&D costs. PFE emphasizes the rising complexity and expense of internal R&D, noting that decisions made early in the development process can significantly affect marketing and reimbursement strategies. PFE also acknowledges the risk of failure at any stage of development, which underscores the uncertainty and high stakes of its internally driven R&D model. Together, these perspectives reveal that BMY leverages external partnerships to manage R&D exposure, DHR faces innovation risk through acquisition-based strategies, and PFE grapples with the inherent unpredictability of internal drug development, each shaping their unique financial and strategic approaches to innovation.",

PFE acknowledges entering into off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, particularly in connection with asset sales and other transactions involving indemnifications.

          "chunk_text": "Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan). Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.\n\nOur fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our carrying values of these investments were $1.83 billion and $2.04 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net, (income) expense by $365.6 million and $407.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained.\n\nIndividually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.",

The facility provides backup liquidity for the Company's commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has not drawn funding from this facility.\n\nThe Company expects foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through existing cash and cash equivalents  and  anticipated  cash  flows  from  operations,  as  well  as  commercial  paper  borrowings  and  long-term  borrowings  if needed. Merck believes that its sources of financing will be adequate to meet its future requirements. The Company's material cash requirements arising in the normal course of business primarily include:\n\nDebt Obligations and Interest Payments - See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of the Company's debt obligations and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments.\n\nTax Liabilities In connection with the enactment of the TCJA, the Company is required to pay a one-time transition tax, which the Company has elected to pay over a period of eight years through 2025 as permitted under the TCJA. Additionally, the Company has liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information pertaining to the transition tax and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nOperating  Leases  See  Note  10  to  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  details  of  the  Company's  lease obligations and the timing of expected future lease payments.\n\nContingent Milestone Payments - The Company has accrued liabilities for contingent sales-based milestone payments related to collaborations with AstraZeneca, Eisai, and Bayer where payment has been deemed probable, but remains subject to the achievement of the related sales milestone. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these sales-based milestones.\n\nPurchase Obligations - Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services  including  minimum  inventory  contracts,  research  and  development  and  advertising.  Purchase  obligations  also  include future inventory purchases the Company has committed to in connection with certain divestitures. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had total purchase obligations of $5.3 billion, of which $1.6 billion is estimated to be payable in 2022.\n\nIn  March  2021,  the  Company  filed  a  securities  registration  statement  with  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange Commission (SEC) under the automatic shelf registration process available to 'well-known seasoned issuers' which is effective for three years.\n\nEffective as of November 3, 2009, the Company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp. (MSD) and MSD executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the Company (excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. These guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.\n\nThe Company believes it maintains a conservative financial profile. The Company places its cash and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in its investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not participate in any off-balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose the Company to unrecorded financial obligations.\n\nIn November 2021, Merck's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend, declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.69 per share on the Company's outstanding common stock that was paid in January 2022. In January 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.69 per share on the Company's common stock for the second quarter of 2022 payable in April 2022.\n\nIn October 2018, Merck's Board of Directors authorized purchases of up to $10 billion of Merck's common stock for its treasury. The treasury stock purchase authorization has no time limit and will be made over time in open-market transactions, block transactions,  on  or  off  an  exchange,  or  in  privately  negotiated  transactions.  In  May  2021,  Merck  restarted  its  share  repurchase program, which the Company had temporarily suspended in March 2020. The Company spent $840 million to purchase 11 million shares of its common stock for its treasury during 2021 under this program. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's remaining share repurchase",

See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook -Our Business and Strategy section of this MD&amp;A.\n\nOur current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our business. Our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizer's BOD and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance, we currently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events. In December 2021, our BOD declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, payable on March 4, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 28, 2022. The first-quarter 2022 cash dividend will be our 333rd consecutive quarterly dividend.\n\nSee Note 12 for information on the shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share-purchase plans, including our accelerated share repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2021, our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $5.3 billion.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual, and Other Obligations\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, (i) we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements that may result in contractual and other obligations and (ii) in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that",

      "answer": "BMY explicitly summarizes its stock compensation activity for the year ended December 31, 2024, indicating a structured approach to equity-based incentives. GILD quantifies its stock-based compensation as $834 million in 2024, showing a consistent upward trend over the years, suggesting increasing emphasis on equity compensation to retain talent. JNJ indirectly references stock-based compensation through its deferred tax assets, reporting $717 million in 2024, which implies a more moderate or stable approach compared to GILD\u2019s rising trend. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three companies utilize stock compensation, GILD appears to be increasing its reliance on it, BMY provides transparency on its activity without revealing specific financial figures, and JNJ reflects a more conservative or steady use of equity incentives.",

In connection with this decision, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $881 million, including $58 million recognized in costs of products sold and $823 million recognized within other operating expense (income), net in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income  in  fiscal  year  2022 . The charges  included  $515  million  of  non-cash  impairments  and  write-downs  primarily  related  to $409  million  of intangible  asset  impairments and $58  million  of  inventory  write-downs.  The  Company  also  recorded  charges  of  $366  million  for  commitments  and obligations associated with the decision, which included charges for patient support obligations, restructuring, and other associated costs.\n\n## Contingent Consideration\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  potential  payment  of  future  consideration  that  is  contingent  upon  the  achievement  of  certain  product development milestones and/or contingent on the acquired business reaching certain performance milestones. A liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period, and the change in fair value is recognized within other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe fair value of contingent consideration liabilities at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 was $149 million and $206 million, respectively. At April 26, 2024, $ 96 million was recorded in other accrued expenses , and $53 million was recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At April 28, 2023, $34 million was reflected in other accrued expenses , and $171 million was reflected in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of contingent consideration liabilities:\n\n",

      "question": "How do Bristol-Myers Squibb, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and UnitedHealth Group each quantify their 2023 lease payment obligations, and what does this reveal about their relative real estate and facility financing strategies in the healthcare sector?",
      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb reports a 2023 lease payment of $176 million as part of $1,191 million in total future lease payments, Thermo Fisher Scientific discloses $248 million for 2023 with $1,658 million in total lease obligations, and UnitedHealth Group reports $763 million for 2023 within $4,882 million in total future minimum lease payments. This indicates that UnitedHealth has the largest immediate lease exposure in 2023 among the three, followed by Thermo Fisher and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The differences suggest varied approaches to facility financing, with UnitedHealth maintaining a significantly larger leased footprint relative to the others.",

      "answer": "MDT reported $316 million in unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock as of April 29, 2022, with a weighted average recognition period of 2.5 years. MRK had $699 million in total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, RSUs, and PSUs as of December 31, 2021, to be recognized over 1.9 years. UNH had $905 million in unrecognized compensation expense related to share awards as of December 31, 2021, with a shorter weighted average recognition period of 1.3 years. These differences suggest varying approaches to equity compensation, with UNH having a larger near-term expense burden relative to its peers, while MDT has a longer time horizon for recognizing its expense, potentially reflecting a more extended vesting structure or performance-based conditions.",

Performance share units typically cliff vest after three years. The awards include three metrics: relative total shareholder return (rTSR), revenue growth, and return on investor capital (ROIC). rTSR is considered a market condition metric, and the expense is determined at the grant date and will not be adjusted even if the market condition is not met. Revenue growth and ROIC are considered performance metrics, and  the  expense  is  recorded  over  the  performance  period,  which  will  be  reassessed  each  reporting  period  based  on  the  probability  of achieving the various performance conditions. The number of shares earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based on only actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted. Performance share units are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. Performance share units are not considered issued or outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. Dividend equivalent units are accumulated on performance share units for each component of the award during the vesting period.\n\nThe Company calculates the fair value of the performance share units for each component individually. The fair value of the rTSR metric will be determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of the revenue growth and ROIC metrics are equal to the closing stock price on the grant date.\n\nThe following table summarizes performance share unit activity during fiscal year 2022:\n\n",

Such adjusted awards preserved the same intrinsic value and general terms and conditions (including vesting) as were in place immediately prior to the adjustments.

As there is substantive transfer of risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services. We received $50 million from Abingworth in 2023 and additional amounts subsequently as incurred. We are recognizing the funding as a reduction of Research and development expenses using an attribution model over the period of the related expenses, with $78 million of such reductions recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. for the specified indication, Abingworth will be eligible to receive an approval-based fixed milestone payment of up to $84 million and royalties based on the applicable net sales.\n\n## LEO Pharma\n\nIn January 2025, we entered into a strategic partnership with LEO Pharma A/S ('LEO Pharma') to accelerate the development and commercialization of LEO Pharma's small molecule oral signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 ('STAT6') programs for the potential treatment of patients with inflammatory diseases. Gilead will have global rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize the small molecule oral STAT6 program. LEO Pharma will have the option to potentially cocommercialize oral programs for dermatology outside the U.S. LEO Pharma will hold exclusive global rights to STAT6 topical formulations in dermatology. Upon closing of the agreement, we made a $250 million upfront payment to LEO Pharma. In addition, LEO Pharma is eligible to receive up to approximately $1.5 billion in additional payments and may also receive tiered royalties on sales of oral STAT6 products.\n\n## 8.

There are now three candidates licensed under the original agreement and one candidate for which the license option remains unexercised. M erck paid Kelun-Biotech $38 million in connection with the July option exercise, following which Kelun-Biotech remains eligible to receive future contingent payments aggregating up to $540 million in development-related payments, $1.5 billion in regulatory milestones, and $3.1 billion in sales-based milestones, if Kelun-Biotech does not retain Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and M acau rights for the remaining option ADC and all remaining candidates achieve regulatory approval. In addition, Kelun-Biotech is eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit rate to a low-double-digit rate on future net sales for any commercialized A DC product. A lso, in connection with the agreement, M erck invested $100 million in Kelun-Biotech shares in January 2023.\n\nIn January 2023, M erck acquired Imago BioSciences, Inc. (Imago), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing new medicines for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms and other bone marrow diseases, for $1.35 billion (including payments to settle share-based equity awards) and also incurred approximately $60 million of transaction costs. Imago's lead candidate, bomedemstat (M K-3543, formerly IM G-7289), which is in Phase 3 clinical development, is an investigational orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis, and polycythemia vera, in addition to other indications. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition since bomedemstat represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and deferred income taxes). M erck recorded net assets of $219 million, as well as a charge of $1.2  billion  to Research and development ex penses in 2023 related to the transaction. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition.\n\n## 2022 Transactions\n\nIn October 2022, M erck and Royalty Pharma plc (Royalty Pharma) entered into a funding arrangement under which Royalty Pharma paid M erck $50 million to co-fund M erck's development costs for a Phase 2b trial of M K-8189, an investigational oral phosphodiesterase 10A  (PDE10A ) inhibitor, which was being evaluated for the treatment of schizophrenia. A s Royalty Pharma was sharing the risk of technical and regulatory success with M erck, the development funding was recognized by M erck as an obligation to perform contractual services. A ccordingly , the payment received was recognized by M erck as a reduction to Research and development ex penses ratably over the estimated Phase 2b research period. In 2024, it was determined the Phase 2b clinical trial for M K-8189 as a monotherapy for acute schizophrenia did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint; therefore, further development in schizophrenia, bipolar, and dementia indications has stopped, and the funding arrangement was terminated.\n\nIn September 2022, M erck exercised its option to jointly develop and commercialize V 940 (mRNA -4157), an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy , pursuant to the terms of an existing collaboration and license agreement with M oderna, Inc. (M oderna). See Note 4 for additional information related to this collaboration.\n\nIn A ugust 2022, M erck and Orna Therapeutics (Orna), a biotechnology company pioneering a new investigational class of engineered circular RNA (oRNA) therapies, entered into a collaboration agreement to discover, develop, and commercialize multiple programs, including vaccines and therapeutics in the areas of infectious disease and oncology . Under the terms of the agreement, M erck made an upfront payment to Orna of $150 million, which was recorded as a charge to Research and development expenses in 2022. In addition, Orna is eligible to receive future contingent payments aggregating up to $440 million in development-related payments, $675 million in regulatory milestones, and $2.4 billion in sales-based milestones associated with the progress of the multiple vaccine and therapeutic programs, as well as royalties ranging from a high-single-digit rate to a low-double-digit rate on any approved products derived from the collaboration. M erck also invested $100 million in Orna's Series B preferred shares in 2022.\n\nIn  July  2022,  M erck  and  Orion  Corporation  (Orion)  announced  a  global  co-development  and  co-commercialization  agreement  for  Orion's investigational  candidate  opevesostat  (M K-5684/ODM -208)  and  other  drugs  targeting  cytochrome  P450  11A 1  (CY P11A 1),  an  enzyme  important  in  steroid production. M erck made an upfront payment to Orion of $290 million, which was recorded as a charge to Research and development expenses in 2022. Orion is responsible for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supply of opevesostat. In addition, the contract provided both parties with an option to convert the initial co-development and co-commercialization agreement into a global exclusive license to M erck, which was mutually exercised in July 2024 (as noted above).\n\nIn M ay 2022, in connection with an existing arrangement, M erck exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license outside of Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, M acau and T aiwan for the development, manufacture and commercialization of Kelun-Biotech's trophoblast antigen 2 (TROP2)-targeting ADC programs, including  its  lead  compound,  sacituzumab  tirumotecan  (M K-2870/SKB-264),  which  is  currently  in  Phase  3  clinical  development.  Under  the  terms  of  the agreement, Merck and Kelun-Biotech are collaborating on certain early clinical development plans,",

We expect  to  have  access  to  the  majority  of  our  cash  flows  in  the  future.  In  addition,  we  continue  to  evaluate  our  legal  entity  structure supporting our business operations, and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure, we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations.\n\nBeyond the contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments outlined above, we have recurring cash requirements arising from the normal operation of our business that include capital expenditures, research and developments costs, and other operational costs.\n\nWe believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, current investments, Credit Facility and  related  commercial  paper  programs  as  well  as  our  ability  to  generate  operating  cash  flows  will  satisfy  our  current  and  future contractual  obligations  and  cash  requirements.

Pending Acquisition\n\nOn January 10, 2022, Medtronic and Affera, Inc. (Affera) entered into a definitive agreement in which Medtronic will acquire Affera for $925  million,  including  up  to  $250  million  of  contingent  consideration  related  to  certain  technical  and  regulatory  milestones.  The acquisition is pending clearance of anti-trust filings and other closing conditions.\n\n## Intersect ENT Acquisition\n\nSubsequent  to  fiscal  year  2022,  on  May  13,  2022,  the  Company  acquired  Intersect  ENT.  Total  consideration  for  the  transaction  was approximately $1.2 billion to acquire all outstanding shares of Intersect ENT for $28.25 per share.\n\nAdditional  information  regarding  acquisitions  is  included  in  Note  3  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  \"Item  8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nOn May 25, 2022, the Company and DaVita Inc. ('DaVita') entered into a definitive agreement with the intent to form a new, independent kidney care-focused medical device company ('NewCo') with equal equity ownership. The transaction is expected to close in calendar year 2023, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. We are contributing our entire Renal Care Solutions business ('RCS') to NewCo. RCS is part of the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, and Renal division in our Medical Surgical portfolio, and had revenue of $325 million in fiscal year 2022. We expect to record a non-cash pre-tax impairment of long-lived assets of $60 million to $90 million in the quarter ending July 29, 2022 related to goodwill.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nWe have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation and/or carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant  information  available.  We  base  our  estimates  on  historical  experience  and  on  various  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\n\n## Our critical accounting estimates include the following:\n\nLitigation Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property and commercial disputes,  shareholder  related  matters,  environmental  proceedings,  tax  disputes,  and  governmental  proceedings  and  investigations.  The outcomes of these legal  actions  are  not  completely  within  our  control  and  may  not  be  known  for  prolonged  periods  of  time.  In  some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit  our  ability  to  conduct  business  in  the  applicable  jurisdictions.  Estimating  probable  losses  from  our  litigation  and  governmental proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, or punitive damages; or could result  in  a  change  in  business  practice.

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to 'more likely than not'; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability.\n\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\n\n## R. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRCqualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible dependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be determined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost of providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are measured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net .\n\n## S. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\n\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal and environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\n\n## T. Share-Based Payments\n\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate.\n\n## Note 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative Arrangements\n\n## A. Acquisitions\n\n## Trillium\n\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immunooncology company developing therapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trillium's lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\n\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&amp;D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses , of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired primarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\n\n## Array\n\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs (see Note 3 ). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n64",

MYR focuses on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for the treatment of HDV. The acquisition provided Gilead with Hepcludex, which was conditionally approved by the European Medicines Agency ('EMA') in July 2020 for the treatment of chronic HDV infection in adults with compensated liver disease. Upon closing, MYR became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead. The financial results  of  MYR  were  included  in  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  from  the  date  of  the  acquisition.  Acquisition-related expenses were not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe aggregate consideration for this acquisition of \u20ac1.3 billion (or $1.6 billion) primarily consisted of \u20ac1.0 billion (or $1.2 billion)  paid  upon closing and contingent consideration of up to \u20ac300 million, subject to customary adjustments, representing a potential future milestone payment upon FDA approval of Hepcludex. The fair value of this contingent liability, estimated using probability-weighted scenarios for FDA approval, was $341 million as of the acquisition date and was initially recorded in Other long-term obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the second quarter of 2021, the balance was reclassified to Accrued and  other  current  liabilities  on  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  this  contingent  liability  was $317 million as of December 31, 2021. The change in estimated fair value from the acquisition date was primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange remeasurement.\n\nThe  acquisition  of  MYR  was  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination  using  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting.  This method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be generally recognized at fair value as of the acquisition  date.  The  fair  value  estimates  for  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  were  based  upon  valuations  using information known and knowable as of the date of this filing. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could cause an impact to the valuation of assets acquired, including intangible assets, goodwill and the related tax impacts of the acquisition, as well as legal and  other  contingencies.  The  amounts  recognized  will  be  finalized  as  the  information  necessary  to  complete  the  analysis  is obtained, but no later than one year after the acquisition date.",

The  increase  was  partially  offset  by  changes  in  fair  value  of contingent consideration, which resulted in $103 million of income for fiscal year 2022 as compared to $36 million of expense in fiscal year 2021. The net currency impact of remeasurement expense and our hedging programs also partially offset the increase with $70 million of income in fiscal year 2022 and $47 million of expense in fiscal year 2021. Finally, contributing to the change was a $132 million gain related to amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a past acquisition and $76 million of impairment charges related to the abandonment of certain intangible assets, both in fiscal year 2021. Additional information regarding the MCS charges is described in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nOther Non-Operating Income, Net Other  non-operating income, net includes the non-service component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost, investment gains and losses, and interest income. The decrease in other non-operating income, net for fiscal year  2022  is  driven  by  our  equity  method  and  minority  investments  portfolio  offset  by  an  increase  in  income  from  the  non-service component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. Gains on equity method and minority investments were $30 million and $61 million for fiscal year 2022 and 2021, respectively, and income related to the non-service component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefits were $107 million and $86 million, respectively.\n\nInterest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts, amortization of gains or losses on terminated or de-designated interest rate derivative instruments, and charges recognized in connection with the tender and early redemption of senior notes. The decrease in interest expense for fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to the $308 million charge incurred as a result of the early redemption of approximately $6.0 billion of debt during fiscal year 2021.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n",

(1)\n\nBalance at December 31, 2021 includes $151 million recorded as a current liability for amounts expected to be paid within the next 12 months. (2)\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, $620 million and $711 million, respectively, of the liabilities relate to the termination of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture in 2016.  As  part  of  the  termination,  Merck  recorded  a  liability  for  contingent  future  royalty  payments  of  11.5%  on  net  sales  of  all  Merck  products  that  were previously  sold  by  the  joint  venture  through  December  31,  2024.  The  fair  value  of  this  liability  is  determined  utilizing  the  estimated  amount  and  timing  of projected cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 8% to present value the cash flows. (3)\n\nThe additions to contingent consideration in 2020 relate to the acquisition of Themis (see Note 4). The payments of contingent consideration in both years relate to the Sanofi Pasteur MSD liabilities described above.\n\n## Other Fair Value Measurements\n\nSome of the Company's financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables, are reflected in the balance sheet at carrying value, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.\n\nThe estimated fair value of loans payable and long-term debt (including current portion) at December 31, 2021, was $35.7  billion  compared  with  a  carrying  value  of  $33.1  billion  and  at  December  31,  2020,  was  $36.0  billion  compared  with  a carrying value of $31.8 billion. Fair value was estimated using recent observable market prices and would be considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with corporate and government issuers  of  securities  and  financial  institutions  with  which  it  conducts  business.  Credit  exposure  limits  are  established  to  limit  a concentration with any single issuer or institution. Cash and investments are placed in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in the Company's investment policy guidelines.\n\nThe majority of the Company's accounts receivable arise from product sales in the U.S., Europe and China and are primarily due from drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies, managed health care providers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. The Company also continues to monitor global economic conditions, including the volatility associated with international sovereign economies, and associated impacts on the financial markets and its business.\n\nThe Company's customers with the largest accounts receivable balances are: McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., which represented approximately 20%, 15% and 10%, respectively, of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2021. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. Bad debts have been minimal. The Company does not normally require collateral or other security to support credit sales.\n\nThe  Company  has  accounts  receivable  factoring  agreements  with  financial  institutions  in  certain  countries  to  sell accounts receivable. The Company factored $2.8 billion and $2.1 billion of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively,  under  these  factoring  arrangements,  which  reduced  outstanding  accounts  receivable.  The  cash  received  from  the financial  institutions  is  reported  within  operating  activities  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Cash  Flows.  In  certain  of  these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company will collect customer payments related to the factored receivables, which it then remits to the financial institutions. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had collected $62 million and $102 million,",

      "answer": "Amgen collaborates closely with BeiGene to jointly develop and commercialize a portion of its oncology portfolio, sharing global R&D costs up to $1.25 billion and splitting profits equally during initial commercialization periods in China, with plans for eventual reversion of product rights to Amgen. Bristol-Myers Squibb has expanded its oncology portfolio through strategic acquisitions such as Mirati and Turning Point, signaling a focus on targeted oncology and innovation through external growth. Merck is diversifying its oncology pipeline through a three-pillar strategy focused on immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting, and tissue targeting, with over 20 Phase 3 studies initiated in 2023, including key combinations involving Keytruda across multiple tumor types. Collectively, these approaches highlight Amgen\u2019s partnership-driven model, BMY\u2019s acquisition-led expansion, and Merck\u2019s innovation-focused pipeline diversification in the competitive oncology landscape.",

      "question": "How do Abbott Laboratories, CVS Health, and Gilead Sciences each apply the concept of fair market value in their equity compensation programs, and what do their respective approaches reveal about differences in stock purchase incentives, option pricing, and unvested compensation treatment?",
      "answer": "Abbott Laboratories applies fair market value in its Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees by setting the purchase price at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the purchase date or the first day of the purchase cycle, with 7,461,515 shares available for future issuance as of December 31, 2024. CVS Health uses fair market value at the grant date to calculate dividend yield and option pricing in its equity compensation framework, reflecting its semi-annual purchase period and six-month expected term for ESPP purchases. Gilead Sciences ties stock option exercise prices to the fair market value on the grant date, ensuring no option has a term exceeding 10 years, and reports $31 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance share units. Together, these approaches show varying degrees of reliance on fair market value: Abbott uses it as a benchmark for discounted purchases, CVS incorporates it into dividend and volatility modeling, and Gilead anchors executive compensation instruments directly to it, each reflecting distinct philosophies in aligning employee incentives with shareholder value.",

      "answer": "JNJ provides a detailed reconciliation of its accrued rebates, showing a $287 million balance at the end of 2021, with $893 million in accruals and $895 million in payments during the year, indicating active rebate liability management. MDT discloses $981 million in rebates classified as other accrued expenses and $548 million as a reduction of accounts receivable as of April 29, 2022, showing a significant portion of rebate obligations are treated as current liabilities. PFE explains that rebates are a key component of revenue deductions, with specific mention of U.S. government and PBM rebate programs, and notes that these are estimated based on historical experience and contract terms, reflecting a more qualitative and policy-driven approach. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies manage rebates as a major revenue adjustment, the methods of quantification and balance sheet classification vary, likely reflecting differences in product mix, market exposure, and contractual structures across the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors.",

Foreign Currency Translation\n\nFor most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss) . The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net . For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net , and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.\n\n## H. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable\n\nRevenue Recognition --We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to the customer. We typically determine transfer of control based on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer.\n\nOur Sales Contracts --Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S. Sales are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns occur due to LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment.\n\nDeductions from Revenues --Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.\n\nProvisions for pharmaceutical sales returns-Provisions are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns, such as LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.\n\nWe record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate the cost of our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.\n\nThe following outlines our common sales arrangements:\n\n- Customers --Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines products directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies, and integrated delivery networks. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and nongovernment institutions. Prescription pharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance programs, including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are generally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated amounts by type of product (e.g., patented or unpatented).\n\n## Specifically:\n\n- In the U.S., we sell our products principally to distributors and hospitals. We also have contracts with managed care programs or PBMs and legislatively mandated contracts with the federal and state governments under which we provide rebates based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior periods. We apply the experience ratio to the respective period's sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare 'coverage gap,' also known as the 'doughnut hole,' based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the coverage gap. We evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends and future expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in formulary status and rebate rates.\n- Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales within each period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government's total unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.\n- Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices and legislated discounts to third parties) closely approximate actual amounts incurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.\n\nWe recorded direct product sales and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products in 2021, for each of seven products in 2020 and for each of six products in 2019. In the aggregate, these direct products sales and/or alliance product revenues represented 75% of our revenues in 2021, 54% of our revenues in 2020 and 49% of our revenues in 2019. See Note 17B for additional information. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally be at lower selling prices and lower volumes due to added generic competition. We generally provide for higher sales returns during the period in which individual markets begin to near the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n60",

Eli Lilly (LLY) explains that IPR&D is capitalized at fair value from business combinations and treated as indefinite-lived until completion or abandonment, using a probability-weighted income method for valuation, which reflects development and commercialization risk.

Clinical  trial  costs  incurred  by  third  parties  are  expensed  as  the  contracted  work  is  performed.  Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.\n\nACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&amp;D) - The initial costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&amp;D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research  and  development  collaboration  agreements  that  provide  rights  to  develop,  manufacture,  market  and/or  sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized  and  accounted  for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  until  completed  and  are  then  amortized  over  the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.\n\nCONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES - Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to  significant  concentration  risks  relating  to  customers,  products  or  geographic  locations.  Product  warranties  are  not significant.\n\nAbbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights  in  which Abbott  agrees  to  pay  contingent  consideration  based  on  attaining  certain  thresholds  or  based  on  the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Note 2 - New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn  June  2016,  the  FASB  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2016-13, Financial  Instruments  -  Credit Losses ,  which  changes  the  methodology  to  be  used  to  measure  credit  losses  for  certain  financial  instruments  and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the  current  estimate  of  credit  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  financial  asset. Abbott  adopted  the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2019-12, Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Simplifying  the  Accounting  for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod  tax  allocations  and  the  methodology  for  calculating  income  taxes  in  an  interim  period,  and  clarifies  the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3 - Revenue\n\nAbbott's  revenues  are  derived  primarily  from  the  sale  of  a  broad  line  of  health  care  products  under  short-term receivable  arrangements.  Patent  protection  and  licenses,  technological  and  performance  features,  and  inclusion  of Abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott's products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.",

          "chunk_text": "The eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&amp;D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition. If the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the intangible asset to its estimated fair value. For example, in 2019, we recognized an $800 million impairment charge related to IPR&amp;D projects primarily for the treatment of indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma due to changes in estimated market opportunities. A high rate of failure is inherent in the discovery and development of new products.\n\nIntangible assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of amortization.\n\nSee Note 9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Legal Contingencies\n\nWe  are  a  party  to  various  legal  actions.  The  most  significant  of  these  are  described  in  Note  14.  Commitments  and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a material loss is reasonably possible, we disclose the possible loss or range of loss, or that the amount of loss cannot be estimated at this time.\n\nSignificant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matters, accruals are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment, including the legal facts and circumstances of the case,  status  of  the  proceedings,  applicable  law  and  the  views  of  legal  counsel.  Upon  the  final  resolution  of  such  matters,  it  is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded an accrual of $1.25 billion in Accrued and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for  the  settlement  related  to  bictegravir  litigation.  See  Note  14.  Commitments  and  Contingencies  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe  estimate  our  income  tax  provision,  including  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  based  on  significant  management judgment. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets each reporting period. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering or have made changes to existing tax laws. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.\n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained  upon  examination  by  tax  authorities  based  on  the  technical  merits  of  the  position.  The  tax  benefit  recognized  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits ('UTB') is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as  significant  amendments  to  existing  tax  law,  new  regulations  or  interpretations  by  tax  authorities,  new  information  obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTB in Income tax (expense) benefit on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nThere have been no new accounting pronouncements issued nor adopted during the year ended December 31, 2021 that are of significance to us.",

          "chunk_text": "\nMarketed products consist of the amortized cost of the rights to assets acquired in business combinations and approved for marketing in a significant global jurisdiction (U.S., Europe, and Japan) and capitalized milestone payments. For transactions other than a business combination, we capitalize milestone payments incurred at or after the product has obtained regulatory approval for marketing.\n\nOther finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of the amortized cost of licensed platform technologies that have alternative future uses in research and development, manufacturing technologies, and customer relationships from business combinations.\n\nAcquired IPR&amp;D consists of the fair values of acquired IPR&amp;D projects acquired in business combination, adjusted for subsequent impairments, if any. The costs of acquired IPR&amp;D projects acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination are capitalized as other intangible assets if the projects have an alternative future use; otherwise, they are expensed immediately. See Note 3 for acquired IPR&amp;D projects that had no alternative future use.\n\nSeveral methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of other intangibles acquired in a business combination. We utilize the \"income method,\" which is a Level 3 fair value measurement and applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected revenues and estimated costs. These projections are based on factors such as relevant market size, patent protection, historical pricing of similar products, analyst expectations, and expected industry trends. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate. This analysis is performed for each asset independently. The acquired IPR&amp;D assets are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects, at which time the assets are tested for impairment and amortized over the remaining useful life or written off, as appropriate.\n\nThe change in marketed products in 2021 primarily related to the sale of rights to Qbrexza in 2021 as well as the impairment of a Phase I molecule related to a contract-based intangible. See Note 5 for additional information. These decreases were more than offset by the recognition of several milestones related to the COVID-19 therapies that occurred in 2021. The increase in the acquired IPR&amp;D in 2021 is due to the acquisition of Prevail. See Note 3 for additional information regarding intangible assets acquired in a recent business combination and Note 4 for additional information regarding capitalized milestone payments.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. Finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when an indicator of impairment is present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. When determining the fair value of indefinite-lived acquired IPR&amp;D as well as the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets for impairment testing purposes, we utilize the \"income method\" discussed above.",

Bristol-Myers Squibb's sales growth is closely tied to the successful execution of its acquisitions, such as Celgene and Karuna, which have increased its debt and created financial risks, but also expanded its pipeline and product offerings. Danaher experienced a 4% year-over-year decline in sales in high-growth markets, primarily due to a low double-digit drop in China, which was driven by weaker capital spending and lower demand across all segments.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Financial Review\n\nAbbott's revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products, which include medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional  products  and  branded  generic  pharmaceuticals.  These  products  are  sold  under  short-term  receivable  arrangements.  Patent  protection  and  licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and the measurement of net sales and costs is impacted by foreign currency translation. Sales in international markets comprise 61 percent of consolidated net sales.\n\nAbbott's sales growth in 2024 was primarily driven by the Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceutical and Nutritional businesses. The growth is the result of a productive research and development (R&amp;D) pipeline and a combination of the introduction of new products and indication expansions across various businesses. Sales growth was negatively impacted by continued year-over-year decline in COVID-19 testing-related sales, as the COVID-19 pandemic shifted to an endemic state. In  2024,  2023  and  2022, Abbott's  COVID-19  testing  related  sales  total  $747  million,  $1.6  billion  and  $8.4  billion,  respectively.  Sales  in  emerging  markets,  which represent approximately 37 percent of total company sales, increased 8.2 percent in 2024 and 5.4 percent in 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries, ex cept the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Western European countries.)\n\nAbbott's operating margin profile increased in 2024 to 16.3 percent from 16.2 percent in 2023.  The increase in 2024 reflects the favorable impact of margin improvement initiatives, partially offset by foreign ex change and inflation. In 2022, operating margin as a percentage of sales was 19.2 percent. The decrease in 2023 from 2022 reflects the unfavorable effects of lower COVID-19 testing-related sales, foreign exchange, and higher costs for various manufacturing inputs. In 2023, these unfavorable effects were partially offset by the favorable impact of margin improvement initiatives.\n\nWith respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years, sales in the Medical Devices segment, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 13.7 percent in 2024 and 15.1 percent in 2023. In Medical Devices, sales in 2024 and 2023 increased across all businesses, with double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Heart Failure. In 2023, Neuromodulation sales also increased double digits. G rowth was led by Diabetes Care where sales of Abbott's continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems continued to increase and totaled $6.4 billion in 2024 and $5.3 billion in 2023.\n\nIn 2024, key product approvals in the Medical Devices segment included:\n\n- U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for two new over-the-counter CGM systems, Lingo and Libre Rio\u2122, which are based on Abbott's FreeStyle Libre CGM technology, \u00ae \u00ae\n- FDA approval of the Esprit\u2122 below-the-knee (BTK) system, which is designed to keep arteries open in people living with peripheral artery disease and deliver a drug to support vessel healing prior to completely dissolving,\n- FDA approval of TriClip , which provides a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with tricuspid regurgitation, or a leaky tricuspid heart valve, \u00ae\n- CE Mark for the Aveir dual chamber (DR) leadless pacemaker system, which is the world's first dual chamber leadless pacemaker system that treats people with abnormal or slow heart rhythms, and \u00ae\n- FDA clearance for Advisor HD Grid X Mapping Catheter, Sensor Enabled\u2122, which will further support mapping of both pulsed field ablation (PFA) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation cases. \u00ae\n\nOperating earnings for the Medical Devices segment increased 16.0 percent in 2024 and 19.6 percent in 2023. The operating margin profile for the Medical Devices segment increased from 30.0 percent in 2022 to 31.4 percent in 2023 and then increased to 32.4 percent in 2024. The increase in 2024 from 2022 reflects the impact of higher sales volumes across the Medical Devices businesses.\n\nIn Abbott's Diagnostics segment, sales decreased 3.9 percent in 2024 and 38.2 percent in 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The 2024 and 2023 sales decreases were driven by continued lower demand for the company's portfolio of COVID-19 tests, partially offset by higher volume of routine diagnostic tests in the Rapid Diagnostics and Core Laboratory businesses and the continued deployment of Abbott's Alinity testing platform. Abbott continues to build out its test menu for the Alinity testing platform. In the first quarter of 2024, Abbott received FDA clearance of its i-STAT\u2122 traumatic brain injury (TBI) cartridge for use with the iSTAT Alinity instrument, a whole blood point-of-care test to help assess mild TBI. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Abbott received FDA approval of its new laboratory automation system, GLP systems Track\u2122, to help laboratories optimize lab performance by consolidating multiple analytical instruments into a unified workflow. \u00ae",

Substantial difficulties, costs and delays could result from integrating our acquisitions, including for: (i) R&amp;D, manufacturing, distribution, sales, marketing, promotion and information technology activities; (ii) policies, procedures, processes, controls and compliance; and (iii) tax considerations.\n\nWhere we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities, such as in connection with a joint venture or acquisition, the value of those securities will fluctuate and may depreciate in value. W e may not control the company in which we acquire securities, such as in connection with a collaborative arrangement, and as a result, we will have limited ability to determine its management, operational decisions, internal controls and compliance and other policies, which can result in additional financial and reputational risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets, and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. Our divestitures also may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial  arrangements,  continued  supply  and  services  arrangements,  or  potential  litigation,  following  the  transaction.  Under  these  arrangements, nonperformance by us could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition or reputation.\n\nWe might also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our earnings. The value allocated to certain of our assets could be substantially impaired due to a number of factors beyond our control. New or revised accounting standards, rules and interpretations could result in changes to the recognition of income and expense that may materially and adversely affect our financial results.\n\nIf the execution or implementation of acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful, it could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Moreover, due to the substantial amount of debt that we incurred to finance the cash portion of the Celgene,  MyoKardia,  Mirati,  Karuna  and  RayzeBio  acquisitions,  there  can  be  no  assurance  of  when  we  will  be  able  to  expand  our  business  development capacity. Although we are committed to reducing our debt, pursuing strategic transaction opportunities in the future may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, and could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings.\n\n## Failure to attract and retain a highly qualified workforce could affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize products.\n\nOur success is largely dependent on our continued ability to (i) attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management workforce, including people  with  expertise  in  clinical  R&amp;D,  governmental  regulation  and  commercialization,  and  (ii)  in  connection  with  our  acquisitions,  integrate  corporate cultures and maintain employee morale. W e are facing increasing competition for a limited pool of qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, government entities, research institutions, companies seeking to enter the healthcare space, and companies in other industries.  Additionally, we periodically adjust our personnel needs in response to changing macroeconomic conditions, market opportunities, management changes, acquisitions, cost levels and other internal and external considerations, which may adversely impact our workplace culture and ability to retain and incentivize employees. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain quality talent or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.\n\n## Market, Liquidity and Credit Risks\n\n## We have significant indebtedness that could have negative consequences .\n\nOur acquisitions of Celgene, MyoKardia, Mirati, Karuna and RayzeBio increased the amount of our debt resulting in additional interest expense, and we may incur more debt to finance future acquisitions. This could reduce our financial flexibility to continue capital investments, develop new products and declare future dividends. For example, following the December 2023 announcements of previous acquisitions, Standard &amp; Poor' s downgraded BMS' s long term-credit rating from A+ to A (with a stable long-term credit outlook).\n\n## Adverse changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\n\nGlobal  economic  and  political  risks  pose  significant  challenges  to  a  company' s  growth  and  profitability  and  are  difficult  to  mitigate.

For the same period, core sales in dev eloped markets were essentially flat, primarily due to increased core sales in North America offset by decreased core sales in Western Europe. Increased demand in the Diagnostics segment, offset by decreased demand in the Biotechnology and Life Sciences segments, contributed to the year-ov er-year flat core sales growth in dev eloped markets. For the same period, sales in high-growth markets decreased year-ov er-year by 4% and core sales in high-growth markets decreased at a mid-single digit rate, due primarily to low double-digit core rev enue declines in China. The decline in core sales in high-growth markets was primarily driv en by lower demand across all segments, due to weakness in capital spending and generally lower underlying activ ity lev els. High-growth markets represented approximately 29% of the Company's total sales in 2024.\n\nThe Company's net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $3.9 billion, compared to approximately $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $3.9 billion or $5.29 per diluted common share compared to approximately $4.7 billion or $6.38 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2023. 2024 intangible asset impairments and increased operating expenses, net of increased other income, drov e the year-ov er-year decline in net earnings from continuing operations and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations. In addition to the abov e factors, net earnings from discontinued operations for 2024 compared with 2023 contributed to the lower net earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2024. Refer to '-Results of Operations' for further discussion of the year-ov er-year changes in net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. In response to current economic conditions, the Company expects to rev iew and adjust its cost structure. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company commenced an initiativ e to identify productiv ity improv ement and cost sav ings opportunities that we anticipate would generate annual pre-tax sav ings of at least $150 million. The Company expects these opportunities to be broadbased, including opportunities within China and the Diagnostics segment.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2024, the Company acquired 3 businesses for total consideration of $558 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company's Life Sciences segment. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of $305 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Company's acquisitions.\n\n## Veralto Corporation Separation\n\nOn September 30, 2023 (the 'Distribution Date'), the Company completed the separation (the 'Separation') of its former Env ironmental &amp; Applied Solutions business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Veralto Corporation ('Veralto'), the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Veralto common stock for ev ery three shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of September 13, 2023, the record date for the distribution. Fractional shares of Veralto common stock that otherwise would hav e been distributed were aggregated and sold into the public market and the proceeds distributed to Danaher stockholders who otherwise would hav e receiv ed fractional shares of Veralto common stock.\n\nThe accounting requirements for reporting the Separation as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed.

Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.\n\nAdditionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## It  is  costly  for  Abbott  to  comply  with  numerous  governmental  regulations  and  to  develop  compliant  products  and  processes,  and  consequences  for  noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\n\nAbbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\n\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval, clearance, or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, postmarket changes to products, advertising, and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, consent decrees, seizures of Abbott's products, and civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution.\n\nThese actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy any actual or potential issues; the inability to obtain future product approvals, clearances, or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For example, in  February 2022, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall of certain powder infant formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan at which time it temporarily stopped manufacturing at the facility. In May 2022, Abbott entered into a consent decree with the FDA. For information on the impact of Abbott's voluntary recall and manufacturing stoppage, see the discussion in the 'Financial Review' section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.\n\n## Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\n\nAbbott's  industry  is  subject  to  various  international,  supranational,  federal,  and  state  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to  government  benefit  program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. V iolations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and V eterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices.

          "chunk_text": "In addition, critics of the 12-year ex clusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law may continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law's provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. In 2019, the Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as 'umbrella exclusivity').  If  the  FDA  were  to  decide  that  umbrella  ex clusivity  does  not  apply  to  biological  reference  products  or  were  to  make  other  changes  to  the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, eliminate the standard for interchangeability and declare by law that all biosimilars are de facto interchangeable with their reference products, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and pass new laws requiring more disclosure in the FDA's Orange Book and Purple Book. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two  agencies,  offering  training  to  help  identify  prior  art,  and  seeking  USPTO's  views  on  practices  that  ex tend  market  ex clusivities,  whether  pharmaceutical  patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board on drug patents. The USPTO responded in July 2022 with a letter to the FDA stating that it is prepared to create formal mechanisms to collaborate with the FDA on patent issues that may affect the timing of generic and biosimilar entry. In January 2023, the USPTO held a joint listening session with the FDA on USPTO-FDA collaboration efforts.\n\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Additionally, if one of our products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product (and existing patents for a small molecule product) by an additional six months. Further, in 2023, the FDA released draft guidance that contemplates that the agency may no longer grant pediatric exclusivity for studies conducted solely to fulfill  Pediatric  Research  Equity Act (PREA) requirements.\n\nWhile we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first state to have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against 'pay for delay' settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement agreements are presumptively anticompetitive. The law may result in prolonged litigation and fewer settlements. Similar legislation based on California's law continues to be introduced in other states, including Connecticut and New Y ork. Efforts to target such settlements are also active at the federal level, including legislation introduced such as the Preserving Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act that adopts California's anticompetitive presumption approach.\n\nConcentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors, and consolidation of private payers, such as insurers, and PBMs has negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, our business.\n\nCertain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: McKesson Corporation, Cencora, Inc. (formerly AmerisourceBergen Corporation) and Cardinal Health, Inc. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics,  dialysis  centers,  hospitals  and  pharmacies.  Similarly,  as  discussed  above,  there  has  been  significant  consolidation  in  the  health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. For example, the six largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers, and nationally account for 94% of prescription drug claims. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to ex tract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to",

          "chunk_text": "The Company's Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan products also are heavily regulated by CMS and state Medicaid agencies, which have the right to audit the Company's performance to determine compliance with CMS contracts and regulations. The Company's Medicaid products, dual eligible products and CHIP contracts also are subject to complex federal and state regulations and oversight by state Medicaid agencies regarding the services provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services, network requirements (including mandatory inclusion of specified high-cost providers), and other aspects of these programs, and by external review organizations which audit Medicaid plans on behalf of state Medicaid agencies. The laws, regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Company and other participants in Medicaid and dual eligible programs, including requirements that the Company submit encounter data to the applicable state agency, are extensive, complex and subject to change. For example, in April 2024, CMS finalized the Managed Care Rule, which addresses five primary areas: (1) access in managed care, including network adequacy; (2) state directed payments; (3) medical loss ratio standards; (4) in lieu of services and settings and (5) quality and performance assessment. The Company has invested significant resources to comply with these standards, and its Medicaid and dual eligible program compliance efforts will continue to require significant resources. CMS and/or state Medicaid agencies may fine the Company, withhold payments to the Company, seek premium and other refunds, terminate the Company's existing contracts, elect not to award the Company new contracts or not to renew the Company's existing contracts, prohibit the Company from continuing to market and/or enroll members in or refuse to automatically assign members to one or more of the Company's Medicaid or dual eligible products, exclude the Company from participating in one or more Medicaid or dual eligible programs and/or institute other sanctions and/or civil monetary penalties against the Company if it fails to comply with CMS or state regulations or contractual requirements. CMS has proposed requiring that health plans offering certain dual eligible programs must also offer Medicaid programs, which has resulted in the Company refraining from bidding in certain jurisdictions and could impact the Company's ability to obtain or retain membership in its dual eligible programs.\n\nThe Company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation or court proceedings will change various aspects of the Medicaid program, nor can it predict the impact those changes will have on its business operations or operating results, but the effects could be materially adverse.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid Audits - CMS regularly audits the Company's performance to determine its compliance with CMS' regulations and its contracts with CMS and to assess the quality of services it provides to Medicare Advantage and PDP beneficiaries. For example, CMS conducts risk adjustment data validation ('RADV') audits of a subset of Medicare Advantage contracts for each contract year. Since 2011, CMS has selected certain of the Company's Medicare Advantage contracts for various years for RADV audit, and the number of RADV audits continues to increase. The OIG also is auditing the Company's risk adjustment data and that of other companies, and the Company expects CMS and the OIG to continue auditing risk adjustment data. The Company also has received Civil Investigative Demands ('CIDs') from, and provided documents and information to, the Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with investigations of the Company's identification and/or submission of diagnosis codes related to risk adjustment payments, including patient chart review processes, under Parts C and D of the Medicare program.\n\nOn January 30, 2023, CMS released the final rule concerning Part C contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits (the 'RADV Audit Rule'). The RADV Audit Rule eliminated the application of a fee-for-service adjuster ('FFS Adjuster') in contract-level RADV audits but continued the use of extrapolation in such audits of Medicare Advantage organizations. The FFS Adjuster that was announced in 2012 was to be used by CMS to determine a permissible level of payment error. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare Advantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent that their extrapolated payment errors ex ceeded the error rate in Original Medicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare Advantage organizations are subject. CMS is conducting RADV audits of Medicare Advantage organizations, including the Company's Medicare Advantage plans, for payment year 2018 and subsequent payment years and may use extrapolation without the application of a FFS Adjuster. The RADV Audit Rule may have potential adverse effects, which could be material, on the Company's operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. CMS also has announced that it will not conduct RADV audits on all contracts; instead, it will only audit contracts it believes are at the highest risk for overpayments based on its statistical modeling. The RADV Audit Rule is subject to ongoing litigation and the outcome and future impacts are uncertain.\n\nIn addition, state Medicaid agencies regularly audit, and state Attorneys General regularly investigate, the Company's performance across all areas of its contractual obligations to the state to determine compliance and quality of services. The Company may be subject to, among other penalties, significant fines, sanctions, corrective actions, and enrollment freezes depending on the findings of these audits and reviews. The Company's ongoing performance and compliance with program requirements can impact our ability to expand and retain Medicaid business. State Medicaid agencies are also increasingly using the audit process to challenge the legality of PBM practices, such as guaranteed effective rate reconciliations with retail pharmacies and transmission fees.",

We have incurred, and will continue to incur, inventory write-off charges and other expenses for products that fail to meet specifications and quality standards as well as changes we may adopt in our manufacturing strategy, and we may need to undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenues or market share and damage our reputation. Our business may be adversely affected if approval of any of our product candidates were delayed or if production of our products were interrupted.\n\n## Regulatory and Other Legal Risks\n\nOur operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to maintain compliance, including if significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, could delay or halt commercialization of our products.\n\nThe products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by FDA, EMA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We have filed, and anticipate that we will continue to file, for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products. These and any future marketing applications we file may not be approved by the regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all.  For  ex ample,  in  October  2022,  we  announced that  FDA issued a complete response letter for our  Biologics  License Application for bulevirtide for the treatment of adults with hepatitis delta virus infection. Even if marketing approval is granted for our product candidates, there may be significant limitations on their use. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our product candidates under development will be approved or launched; whether we will be able to develop, license or acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nFurther, how we manufacture and sell our products is subject to extensive regulation and review. For example, under FDA rules, we are often required to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk. In certain circumstances, we may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for our products, which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers, restrictions on distribution or use of a product and other elements FDA deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or product candidates, including serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, or problems with our manufacturing, safety reporting or promotional activities, may result in regulatory approvals being delayed, denied or granted with significant restrictions on our products, including limitations on or the withdrawal of the products from the market.\n\nAs additional studies are conducted after obtaining marketing approval for our products, and as our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients, including patients with underlying health problems or those taking other medicines, we expect to continue finding new issues related to safety, resistance or drug interactions. Any such issues may require changes to our product labels, such as additional warnings, contraindications or even narrowed indications, or the halt of product sales.\n\nRegulatory  authorities  have  been  moving  towards  more  active  and  transparent  pharmacovigilance  and  are  making  greater  amounts  of  stand-alone  safety information  and  clinical  trial  data  directly  available  to  the  public  through  websites  and  other  means,  such  as  periodic  safety  update  report  summaries,  risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action.\n\nFailure  to  comply  with  these  or  other  requirements  imposed  by  FDA  could  result  in  significant  civil  monetary  penalties,  fines,  suspensions  of  regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecutions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access and Certain Other Regulatory Developments\n\nReforms, including those that may stem from political initiativ es, periods of unev en economic growth or downturns, or as a result of inflation or deflation, the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, international tension and conflicts, or gov ernment budgeting priorities, are expected to continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\n\nGlobal concern ov er access to, and affordability of, pharmaceutical products continues to driv e regulatory and legislativ e debate and action, as well as cost containment efforts by gov ernmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictiv e formularies, changes to av ailable intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. In 2022, the U.S. gov ernment enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices (HHS) to effectiv ely set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these gov ernment prices apply beginning at nine years (for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application) or thirteen years (for medicines approv ed under a Biologics License Application) following FDA approv al or licensure for the molecule and are set at a price that generally represents a significant discount from existing prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. While the law specifies a maximum price that HHS can set, it does not set a minimum price. The Medicare price HHS determines may impact the product's best price determination under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, potentially leading to a negativ e impact on both Medicaid and 340B prices. In August 2023, HHS selected Jardiance, which is part of our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as one of the first ten medicines subject to gov ernment-set prices effectiv e in 2026. In August 2024, HHS announced the government-set prices for these medicines with Jardiance subject to a 66% discount compared to the 2023 U.S. calendar year list price for a 30-day supply and discounts for the other nine medicines ranging from approximately 38% to 79% below list price. Giv en our product portfolio, we expect additional significant products will be selected in future years, which would hav e the effect of accelerating rev enue erosion prior to expiry of exclusiv ities. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\n\nOther IRA prov isions require drug manufacturers to prov ide rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D medicines under certain circumstances. Also, on January 1, 2025, the Part D benefit redesign replaced the Part D Cov erage Gap Discount Program with a new manufacturer discount program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to v arious penalties, including civ il monetary penalties, which could be significant.\n\nThe IRA has, and will continue to, meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approv ed under a New Drug Application reduces the attractiv eness of inv estment in small molecule innov ation. The IRA can cause changes to dev elopment approach and timing and inv estments at-risk. The full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain.\n\nAdditional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by lawmakers, regulators, and other authorities in the U.S. and worldwide, could adv ersely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For example, the U.S. House of Representativ es recently passed the BIOSECURE Act, which is under consideration in the U.S. Senate.

      "answer": "ABBV reports that the fair value of its long-term debt was $49.5 billion as of year-end 2024, with $48.98 billion measured using Level 1 inputs, indicating high market liquidity. CVS estimates that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of its long-term debt by approximately $3.3 billion, highlighting a significant sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. PFE discloses that the fair value of its long-term debt was $54 billion, measured using Level 2 inputs, and notes that the difference between fair value and carrying value is not significant. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three companies are exposed to interest rate risk, CVS explicitly quantifies the potential impact of rate changes, whereas ABBV and PFE rely more on market-based inputs to reflect fair value without projecting forward-looking sensitivity scenarios.",

See ''Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of Debt Securities' in the MD&amp;A included in Item 7 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Evaluation of Market Valuation Risks\n\nThe Company regularly evaluates its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investments relative to management-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company's consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest rate changes (whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for the Company. The Company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates (which the Company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive investments and an immediate decrease of 15% in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities in the Company's investment portfolio.\n\nAssuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates, the theoretical decline in the fair values of market sensitive instruments at December 31, 2024 is as follows:\n\n- The fair value of long-term debt issued by the Company would decline by approximately $3.3 billion ($4.1 billion pretax). Changes in the fair value of long-term debt do not impact the Company's operating results or financial condition.\n- The theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approx imately $650 million ($820 million pretax ) related to continuing non-ex perience-rated products. Net reductions in fair value would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these debt securities as available for sale, and the effect of the interest rate on interest rate sensitive liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nIf the value of the Company's publicly traded domestic equity securities held within its investment portfolio were to decline by 15%, this would result in a net decline in fair value of $43 million ($54 million pretax ).\n\nBased on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affect consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2024.\n\n## Evaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity Risk\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place and believes its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material.\n\n## Evaluation of Operational Risks\n\nThe Company also faces certain operational risks. Those risks include risks related to information security, including cybersecurity.\n\nThe Company and its vendors have experienced diverse cyberattacks and expect to continue to experience cyberattacks going forward. As examples, the Company and its vendors have experienced attempts to gain access to systems, denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, account takeovers, scanning activity and phishing emails. Attacks can originate from external criminals, terrorists, nation states or internal actors. The Company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant ex penses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigate the information security risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information, disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage. The impact of cyberattacks has not been material to the Company's operations or operating results through December 31, 2024. The Board and its Audit Committee are regularly informed",

      "answer": "ABBV reported $3.6 billion in intangible asset impairment charges in 2023, primarily related to Imbruvica, CoolSculpting, and Liletta, which unfavorably impacted gross margin. DHR incurred $64 million in intangible asset impairment charges in 2023, which contributed to a 400 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. PFE recorded $3.0 billion in intangible asset impairment charges in 2023, driven by assets such as etrasimod (Velsipity IPR&D), Prevnar 13 developed technology rights, and other IPR&D assets, reflecting changes in development plans, commercial forecasts, and competitive pressures. Collectively, these figures highlight differing challenges: ABBV faced significant declines in value from key products, DHR experienced smaller but notable impairments amid broader cost pressures, and PFE absorbed major strategic write-downs tied to R&D and commercial expectations.",

      "question": "How do AbbVie (ABBV), Abbott (ABT), and Amgen (AMGN) each account for clinical trial costs in their financial reporting, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to managing R&D expenses tied to drug development timelines?",
      "answer": "All three companies expense clinical trial costs as incurred or as contracted work is performed, but they differ in how they integrate these costs within broader R&D frameworks and milestone-based payment structures. AbbVie (ABBV) explicitly ties clinical trial costs to third-party contracts and milestone payments, with contingent payments expensed upon achievement. Abbott (ABT) similarly expenses clinical trial costs as contracted work progresses, but places less emphasis on milestone-based structuring in its disclosure. Amgen (AMGN) also expenses R&D costs\u2014including clinical trials\u2014as incurred, but highlights cost recoveries and third-party arrangements, indicating a more collaborative and cost-shared model. These differences suggest that while all three companies align on expensing clinical trial costs contemporaneously, their financial strategies around external R&D funding and milestone triggers vary, reflecting distinct risk-sharing and partnership models in drug development.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABBV \u2192 Clinical Trial Costs: ABBV discloses that clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Contingent milestone payments under R&D collaborations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved, indicating a clear link between trial progress and expense recognition.",
        "Hop 2: ABT \u2192 Clinical Trial Costs: ABT states that clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed, similar to ABBV. However, ABT does not emphasize milestone-based payments in its R&D cost structure, suggesting a more straightforward contractual expense model.",
        "Hop 3: AMGN \u2192 Clinical Trial Costs: AMGN reports that R&D expenses include clinical trial and related manufacturing costs, and that these are expensed as incurred. It also notes that net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs (including those from third parties) is recognized when obligations are incurred or cost recovery is entitled, indicating a more dynamic cost-sharing mechanism."

          "chunk_text": "typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography.\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nInternal research and development (R&amp;D) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n\n## Collaborations and Other Arrangements\n\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to R&amp;D expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.1 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.1 billion in 2019.\n\n## Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits\n\nAbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are generally amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five-year period.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\n## Cash and Equivalents\n\nCash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.",

Clinical  trial  costs  incurred  by  third  parties  are  expensed  as  the  contracted  work  is  performed.  Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.\n\nACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&amp;D) - The initial costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&amp;D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research  and  development  collaboration  agreements  that  provide  rights  to  develop,  manufacture,  market  and/or  sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized  and  accounted  for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  until  completed  and  are  then  amortized  over  the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.\n\nCONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES - Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to  significant  concentration  risks  relating  to  customers,  products  or  geographic  locations.  Product  warranties  are  not significant.\n\nAbbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights  in  which Abbott  agrees  to  pay  contingent  consideration  based  on  attaining  certain  thresholds  or  based  on  the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Note 2 - New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn  June  2016,  the  FASB  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2016-13, Financial  Instruments  -  Credit Losses ,  which  changes  the  methodology  to  be  used  to  measure  credit  losses  for  certain  financial  instruments  and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the  current  estimate  of  credit  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  financial  asset. Abbott  adopted  the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2019-12, Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Simplifying  the  Accounting  for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod  tax  allocations  and  the  methodology  for  calculating  income  taxes  in  an  interim  period,  and  clarifies  the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3 - Revenue\n\nAbbott's  revenues  are  derived  primarily  from  the  sale  of  a  broad  line  of  health  care  products  under  short-term receivable  arrangements.  Patent  protection  and  licenses,  technological  and  performance  features,  and  inclusion  of Abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott's products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues consist primarily of royalty income and corporate partner revenues. Royalties from licensees are based on thirdparty sales of licensed products and are recorded when the related third-party product sale occurs. Royalty income is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends. Corporate partner revenues are composed mainly of license fees and milestones earned and our share of commercial profits generated from collaborations. See Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations, discussed below.\n\n## Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  enter  into  arrangements  for  the  R&amp;D,  manufacture  and/or  commercialization  of  products  and  product candidates.  Such  arrangements  may  require  us  to  deliver  various  rights,  services  and/or  goods,  including  intellectual  property rights/licenses, R&amp;D services, manufacturing services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally  provide  for  consideration  to  Amgen  in  the  form  of  nonrefundable,  upfront  license  fees;  development  and  commercialperformance milestone payments; royalty payments; and/or profit sharing.\n\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what  the  selling  price  would  be  if  the  deliverable  was  regularly  sold  by  us  on  a  stand-alone  basis  or  by  using  an  adjusted  market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\n\nThe consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We utilize the sales- and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nR&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems' costs; and amortization of acquired technology used in R&amp;D with alternative future uses. R&amp;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated  with  third-party  R&amp;D  arrangements,  including  upfront  fees  and  milestones  paid  to  third  parties  in  connection  with technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&amp;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 8, Collaborations.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSG&amp;A  costs  are  primarily  composed  of  salaries,  benefits  and  other  staff-related  costs  associated  with  sales  and  marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee on Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $843 million, $962 million and $789 million during the years ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  SG&amp;A  expenses  also  include  costs  and  cost  recoveries  associated  with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&amp;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 8, Collaborations.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt  inception  of  a  contract,  we  determine  whether  an  arrangement  is  or  contains  a  lease.  For  all  leases,  we  determine  the classification as either operating or financing. Operating leases are included in Other noncurrent assets, Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

      "question": "How do Gilead (GILD), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Eli Lilly (LLY) each address the impact of reimbursement rates on their financial performance and market access strategies, and what does this reveal about their differing exposures to pricing pressures in the U.S. and global markets?",
      "answer": "Gilead (GILD) explicitly states that the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will limit the prices it can charge for products, increase rebates for government programs, and reduce profitability. It also notes that Medicaid rebates and the 340B program constrain pricing, with a specific mention of the impact on drugs like Genvoya and CAR-T therapies such as Yescarta and Tecartus. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) indirectly ties reimbursement rates to its competitive landscape, noting that 'price, payer coverage, and reimbursement rates' are key competitive factors, and that reimbursement misalignment could affect hospital adoption of high-cost therapies. Eli Lilly (LLY) highlights that reimbursement rates are a core competitive factor globally, particularly in formulary placement and patient access, and notes that payer-driven cost containment measures, including biosimilar competition and price negotiations, directly affect product uptake and revenue sustainability. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to reimbursement pressures, GILD faces direct regulatory-driven pricing constraints, JNJ emphasizes competitive dynamics shaped by reimbursement, and LLY focuses on global market access and biosimilar threats.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GILD \u2192 Reimbursement Rates: GILD identifies the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 as a direct threat to pricing power, noting increased rebates and capped prices starting in 2026, and highlights specific drugs like Genvoya and CAR-T therapies (Yescarta, Tecartus) that face reimbursement misalignment.",
        "Hop 2: JNJ \u2192 Reimbursement Rates: JNJ states that reimbursement rates are a key competitive factor, affecting hospital adoption and physician recommendation of high-cost therapies, indicating that misaligned reimbursement could limit market access and sales.",
        "Hop 3: LLY \u2192 Reimbursement Rates: LLY emphasizes that reimbursement rates and payer coverage are critical to formulary placement and patient access globally, and that cost-containment strategies, including biosimilar competition and price negotiations, threaten revenue sustainability."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Financial Review\n\nAbbott's revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products, which include medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional  products  and  branded  generic  pharmaceuticals.  These  products  are  sold  under  short-term  receivable  arrangements.  Patent  protection  and  licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and the measurement of net sales and costs is impacted by foreign currency translation. Sales in international markets comprise 61 percent of consolidated net sales.\n\nAbbott's sales growth in 2024 was primarily driven by the Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceutical and Nutritional businesses. The growth is the result of a productive research and development (R&amp;D) pipeline and a combination of the introduction of new products and indication expansions across various businesses. Sales growth was negatively impacted by continued year-over-year decline in COVID-19 testing-related sales, as the COVID-19 pandemic shifted to an endemic state. In  2024,  2023  and  2022, Abbott's  COVID-19  testing  related  sales  total  $747  million,  $1.6  billion  and  $8.4  billion,  respectively.  Sales  in  emerging  markets,  which represent approximately 37 percent of total company sales, increased 8.2 percent in 2024 and 5.4 percent in 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries, ex cept the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Western European countries.)\n\nAbbott's operating margin profile increased in 2024 to 16.3 percent from 16.2 percent in 2023.  The increase in 2024 reflects the favorable impact of margin improvement initiatives, partially offset by foreign ex change and inflation. In 2022, operating margin as a percentage of sales was 19.2 percent. The decrease in 2023 from 2022 reflects the unfavorable effects of lower COVID-19 testing-related sales, foreign exchange, and higher costs for various manufacturing inputs. In 2023, these unfavorable effects were partially offset by the favorable impact of margin improvement initiatives.\n\nWith respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years, sales in the Medical Devices segment, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 13.7 percent in 2024 and 15.1 percent in 2023. In Medical Devices, sales in 2024 and 2023 increased across all businesses, with double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Heart Failure. In 2023, Neuromodulation sales also increased double digits. G rowth was led by Diabetes Care where sales of Abbott's continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems continued to increase and totaled $6.4 billion in 2024 and $5.3 billion in 2023.\n\nIn 2024, key product approvals in the Medical Devices segment included:\n\n- U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for two new over-the-counter CGM systems, Lingo and Libre Rio\u2122, which are based on Abbott's FreeStyle Libre CGM technology, \u00ae \u00ae\n- FDA approval of the Esprit\u2122 below-the-knee (BTK) system, which is designed to keep arteries open in people living with peripheral artery disease and deliver a drug to support vessel healing prior to completely dissolving,\n- FDA approval of TriClip , which provides a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with tricuspid regurgitation, or a leaky tricuspid heart valve, \u00ae\n- CE Mark for the Aveir dual chamber (DR) leadless pacemaker system, which is the world's first dual chamber leadless pacemaker system that treats people with abnormal or slow heart rhythms, and \u00ae\n- FDA clearance for Advisor HD Grid X Mapping Catheter, Sensor Enabled\u2122, which will further support mapping of both pulsed field ablation (PFA) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation cases. \u00ae\n\nOperating earnings for the Medical Devices segment increased 16.0 percent in 2024 and 19.6 percent in 2023. The operating margin profile for the Medical Devices segment increased from 30.0 percent in 2022 to 31.4 percent in 2023 and then increased to 32.4 percent in 2024. The increase in 2024 from 2022 reflects the impact of higher sales volumes across the Medical Devices businesses.\n\nIn Abbott's Diagnostics segment, sales decreased 3.9 percent in 2024 and 38.2 percent in 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The 2024 and 2023 sales decreases were driven by continued lower demand for the company's portfolio of COVID-19 tests, partially offset by higher volume of routine diagnostic tests in the Rapid Diagnostics and Core Laboratory businesses and the continued deployment of Abbott's Alinity testing platform. Abbott continues to build out its test menu for the Alinity testing platform. In the first quarter of 2024, Abbott received FDA clearance of its i-STAT\u2122 traumatic brain injury (TBI) cartridge for use with the iSTAT Alinity instrument, a whole blood point-of-care test to help assess mild TBI. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Abbott received FDA approval of its new laboratory automation system, GLP systems Track\u2122, to help laboratories optimize lab performance by consolidating multiple analytical instruments into a unified workflow. \u00ae",

For the same period, core sales in dev eloped markets were essentially flat, primarily due to increased core sales in North America offset by decreased core sales in Western Europe. Increased demand in the Diagnostics segment, offset by decreased demand in the Biotechnology and Life Sciences segments, contributed to the year-ov er-year flat core sales growth in dev eloped markets. For the same period, sales in high-growth markets decreased year-ov er-year by 4% and core sales in high-growth markets decreased at a mid-single digit rate, due primarily to low double-digit core rev enue declines in China. The decline in core sales in high-growth markets was primarily driv en by lower demand across all segments, due to weakness in capital spending and generally lower underlying activ ity lev els. High-growth markets represented approximately 29% of the Company's total sales in 2024.\n\nThe Company's net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $3.9 billion, compared to approximately $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $3.9 billion or $5.29 per diluted common share compared to approximately $4.7 billion or $6.38 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2023. 2024 intangible asset impairments and increased operating expenses, net of increased other income, drov e the year-ov er-year decline in net earnings from continuing operations and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations. In addition to the abov e factors, net earnings from discontinued operations for 2024 compared with 2023 contributed to the lower net earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2024. Refer to '-Results of Operations' for further discussion of the year-ov er-year changes in net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. In response to current economic conditions, the Company expects to rev iew and adjust its cost structure. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company commenced an initiativ e to identify productiv ity improv ement and cost sav ings opportunities that we anticipate would generate annual pre-tax sav ings of at least $150 million. The Company expects these opportunities to be broadbased, including opportunities within China and the Diagnostics segment.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2024, the Company acquired 3 businesses for total consideration of $558 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company's Life Sciences segment. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of $305 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Company's acquisitions.\n\n## Veralto Corporation Separation\n\nOn September 30, 2023 (the 'Distribution Date'), the Company completed the separation (the 'Separation') of its former Env ironmental &amp; Applied Solutions business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Veralto Corporation ('Veralto'), the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Veralto common stock for ev ery three shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of September 13, 2023, the record date for the distribution. Fractional shares of Veralto common stock that otherwise would hav e been distributed were aggregated and sold into the public market and the proceeds distributed to Danaher stockholders who otherwise would hav e receiv ed fractional shares of Veralto common stock.\n\nThe accounting requirements for reporting the Separation as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nIn this report, references to the non-GAAP measure of core sales (also referred to as core rev enues or sales/rev enues from existing businesses) refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP') but excluding:\n\n- sales from acquired businesses (as defined below); and\n- the impact of currency translation.\n\nReferences to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniv ersary of the acquisition less any sales and operating profit, during the applicable period, attributable to div ested product lines not considered discontinued operations. The portion of rev enue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:\n\n- the period-to-period change in rev enue (as defined abov e); and\n- the period-to-period change in rev enue (as defined abov e) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.",

In A ugust 2024, the EC approved Winrevair , in combination with other PA H therapies, for the treatment of PA H in adult patients with WHO FC II to III, to improve exercise capacity . The FDA  and EC approvals were based on the STELLAR trial. Winrevair has since launched in Germany . Timing for commercial availability of Winrevair in  the remaining EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures, which is expected to occur in most other major EU markets in the second half of 2025. Winrevair is the subject of a licensing agreement pursuant to which M erck pays a 22% royalty on sales of Winrevair to BM S. The royalty expenses are included in Cost of sales .\n\nAdempas and Verquvo are part of a worldwide collaboration with Bayer A G (Bayer) to market and develop soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulators (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). A dempas is approved for the treatment of certain types of PA H and chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH). Verquvo is approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization following a hospitalization for heart failure or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics in adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. A lliance revenue from the collaboration grew 13% in 2024 reflecting higher demand in Bayer's marketing territories. Revenue also includes sales of A dempas and V erquvo in M erck's marketing territories. Sales of Adempas in Merck's marketing territories grew 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher demand.\n\n## Virology\n\n",

AbbVie notes that reclassifications were made to align prior period statements with current presentation, particularly following the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics in 2024. CVS Health similarly states that prior year amounts were reclassified to conform with the current year's structure, especially in relation to its segment reporting and corporate cost allocations. Thermo Fisher also reclassified prior year amounts for consistency, though it emphasizes that these changes were primarily for presentation purposes and did not affect underlying financial performance.

(AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (i ncluding aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on reimbursement terms.\n\nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.\n\nAbbVie completed its previously announced acquisitions of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen) on February 12, 2024 and Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel Therapeutics) on August 1, 2024. See Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\n\n## Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling i nterest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, i nvoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less.\n\nCash discounts, rebates and chargebacks, sales incentives, product returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by",

As of December 31, 2024, the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment operated more than 9,000 retail locations, as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies, retail specialty pharmacy stores, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Corporate/Other Segment\n\nThe Company presents the remainder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:\n\n- Management and administrative expenses to support the Company's overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources and finance departments, information technology, digital, data and analytics, as well as acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs; and\n- Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as its large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of CVS Health and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP'). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities ('V IEs') for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company invests in short-term money market funds, commercial paper and time deposits, as well as other debt securities that are classified as cash equivalents within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as these funds are highly liquid and readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nRestricted cash included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets primarily represents funds held on behalf of members and funds held in escrow in connection with agreements with accountable care organizations. Restricted cash included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets represents amounts held in a trust in one of the Company's captive insurance companies to satisfy collateral requirements associated with the assignment of certain insurance policies. All restricted cash is invested in demand deposits, time deposits and money market funds.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets to total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n\n",

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\n\nThe company owns 60% of its consolidated subsidiary PPD-SNBL K.K. The 40% ownership interest held by a third party is classified as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet due to certain put options under which the third party may require the company to purchase the remaining ownership interest at a premium upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Presentation\n\nCertain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nAmounts and percentages reported within these consolidated financial statements are presented and calculated based on underlying unrounded amounts. As a result, the sum of components may not equal corresponding totals due to rounding.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents consists principally of money market funds and other marketable securities purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value (see Note 4).\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income.\n\n## Contract-related Balances\n\nAccounts receivable include unconditional rights to consideration from customers, which generally represent billings that do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimates of expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on history of similarly aged receivables, the creditworthiness of the customer, reasons for delinquency, current economic conditions, expectations associated with future events and circumstances where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Receivables from academic and government customers as well as large, well-capitalized commercial customers have historically experienced less collectability risk. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers.",

      "question": "How do Gilead, Johnson & Johnson, and Eli Lilly differ in their accounting treatment for upfront payments made in research and development collaborations, particularly in terms of expense recognition and potential future milestone obligations?",
      "answer": "Gilead treats upfront and milestone payments in R&D collaborations as expenses when incurred, as seen in the $300 million upfront payment for Tmunity and potential future payments up to $1.0 billion tied to milestones and royalties. Johnson & Johnson expenses upfront and milestone payments as incurred up to regulatory approval, after which payments are capitalized and amortized. Eli Lilly recognizes upfront and milestone payments as part of collaboration revenue when earned, and while not making upfront payments, it accounts for potential future milestone obligations as contingent expenses that could materially affect results if multiple milestones are reached in the same period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GILD \u2192 Upfront Payments: Gilead made a $300 million upfront payment to acquire Tmunity and faces potential future milestone payments up to $1.0 billion, which are expensed as development milestones are achieved.",
        "Hop 2: JNJ \u2192 Upfront Payments: Johnson & Johnson expenses upfront and milestone payments as incurred during development, capitalizing regulatory milestone payments post-approval and amortizing them over the product\u2019s life.",
        "Hop 3: LLY \u2192 Upfront Payments: Eli Lilly does not typically make upfront payments but accounts for potential milestone payments as contingent liabilities, recognizing them as expenses upon achievement, which could be material if multiple milestones occur in the same period."

          "chunk_text": "## Tmunity\n\nIn February 2023, we closed an agreement to acquire Tmunity Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tmunity'), a clinical-stage, private biotechnology company focused on nextgeneration chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-therapies and technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired all outstanding shares of Tmunity other than those already owned by Gilead for approximately $300 million in cash consideration. As a result, Tmunity became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded a $244 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2023. The remaining purchase price related to various other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, consisting primarily of deferred tax assets. Under the agreement, the former shareholders of Tmunity and the University of Pennsylvania are eligible to receive a mix of up to approximately $1.0 billion in potential future payments upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, as well as royalty payments on sales, with the first $25 million of milestones charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses in 2023 and paid in January 2024. In 2024, we paid an additional $47 million for development milestones met, which was charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## MiroBio\n\nIn September 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of MiroBio Ltd. ('MiroBio'), a privately-held U.K.-based biotechnology company focused on restoring immune balance with agonists targeting immune inhibitory receptors, for $414 million in cash. As a result, MiroBio became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded a $389 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2022. The remaining purchase price related to various other assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\n## 7.    COLLABORATIONS AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWe enter into licensing and strategic collaborations and other similar arrangements with third parties for the research, development and commercialization of certain products and product candidates. The collaborations involve two or more parties who are active participants in the operating activities of the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the commercial success of the activities. The financial terms of these arrangements may include nonrefundable upfront payments, expense reimbursements, payments by us for options to acquire certain rights, contingent obligations by us for potential development and  regulatory  milestone  payments  and/or  sales-based  milestone  payments,  royalty  payments,  revenue  or  profit-sharing  arrangements  and  cost-sharing arrangements.  Certain  payments  are  contingent  upon  the  occurrence  of  various  future  events  that  have  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty.  Development  milestone payments are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred. Regulatory milestone payments are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to Cost of goods sold over the term of the respective collaboration arrangement. In conjunction with these arrangements, we occasionally purchase shares of the collaboration partner and record such equity investments in either Prepaid and other current assets or Other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, generally depending on marketability and whether the securities are subject to lock-up provisions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product liability\n\nAccruals for product liability  claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. A mounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\n\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. A mounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company's operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that hav e a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to hav e a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, rev enues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in dev elopment and enter into research and dev elopment arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future ev ents linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achiev ement of an important point in the dev elopment life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approv al for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achiev ement of certain sales lev els). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the ev ent that regulatory approv al for marketing is obtained.\n\nIndiv idually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. Howev er, if milestones for multiple products cov ered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectiv ely, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often giv e us the discretion to unilaterally terminate dev elopment of the product, which would allow us to av oid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease dev elopment if the compound successfully achiev es milestone objectiv es. We v iew these payments as positiv e because they signify that the product is successfully mov ing through dev elopment and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.\n\n## APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjectiv e and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any giv en indiv idual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could dev elop different estimates. We believ e that, giv en current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adv erse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates hav e been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\n\n## Background and Uncertainties\n\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product rev enue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, prov isions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on rev enue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\n\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receiv e under these types of contracts.",

      "question": "How do AbbVie (ABBV), Abbott (ABT), and Medtronic (MDT) differ in their approach to business acquisitions in 2023, particularly in terms of cash outflows, strategic focus, and the impact on liquidity and capital allocation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AbbVie (ABBV) reported no cash outflows for business acquisitions, focusing instead on other investments and property acquisitions totaling $1,223 million and $777 million respectively, which reflects a more internally-driven capital allocation strategy. Abbott (ABT) spent $877 million on acquisitions of businesses and technologies, indicating a strategic emphasis on external growth through innovation and technology. Medtronic (MDT), while not providing a specific dollar amount for acquisitions, highlighted a strong financial position and flexibility in its capital structure, suggesting a balanced approach to acquisitions alongside other capital allocation priorities such as R&D and shareholder returns. Collectively, these differences illustrate varying strategic postures: ABBV prioritized internal investments, ABT pursued targeted acquisitions for innovation, and MDT maintained a flexible stance with a long-term view on capital deployment.",

      "answer": "In 2021, DHR paid $10,961 million in cash for acquisitions, JNJ paid $7,323 million, and UNH paid $4,953 million. This indicates that DHR had the most aggressive M&A strategy among the three, significantly outspending both JNJ and UNH. JNJ maintained a moderate acquisition pace, while UNH spent the least, suggesting a more conservative or selective approach to growth through acquisitions in the healthcare sector.",

      "answer": "DHR indicates that it allocates capital toward restructuring activities as part of its broader liquidity planning, showing confidence in its cash flow and borrowing capacity to fund such initiatives. MRK explicitly excludes restructuring-related costs from its segment profits, signaling that these are treated as corporate-level expenses and not tied directly to operational performance. TMO references restructuring activities in its forward-looking statements, implying that such initiatives are part of strategic planning but are not detailed in early sections of the filing, suggesting a more aspirational or future-oriented framing. Together, this shows differing levels of transparency and integration of restructuring into financial reporting across the three firms.",

As of December 31, 2024, the Company held $3 million of publicly-traded equity securities, excluding equity-method inv estments. Additionally, the Company holds non-marketable equity inv estments in priv ately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks. These non-marketable equity inv estments are accounted for under the Fair Value Alternativ e method with changes in fair v alue recorded in earnings. Volatility in the equity markets or other fair v alue considerations could affect the v alue of these inv estments and require losses or gains to be recognized in earnings. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's equity inv estments.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the ev ent of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary inv estments, receiv ables from customers and deriv ativ es. The Company places cash and temporary investments with v arious high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the thirdparty depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equiv alents. The Company's emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.\n\nIn addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receiv ables from customers are limited due to the div ersity of the Company's customers. The Company's businesses perform credit ev aluations of their customers' financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate.\n\nThe Company enters into deriv ativ e transactions infrequently and typically with high-quality financial institutions, so that exposure at any one institution is limited.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nManagement assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, inv esting and financing activ ities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activ ities and believ es that its operating cash flow, cash on hand and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue inv esting in existing businesses (including capital expenditures), consummating strategic acquisitions and inv estments, paying interest and serv icing debt, paying div idends and funding restructuring activ ities, as well as to repurchase common stock when deemed appropriate and manage its capital structure on a short-term and long-term basis.\n\nThe Company has relied primarily on borrowings under its commercial paper program to address liquidity requirements that exceed the capacity prov ided by its operating cash flows and cash on hand, while also accessing the capital markets from time to time including to secure financing for more significant acquisitions. Subject to any limitations that may result from market disruptions, the Company anticipates following the same approach in the future.",

      "answer": "Gilead Sciences (GILD) discloses that it enters into licensing and strategic collaborations that include royalty payments, revenue or profit-sharing arrangements, and cost-sharing agreements, indicating a structured approach to managing IP obligations through contractual frameworks. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) notes that it makes upfront and milestone payments in R&D collaborations, which are capitalized and amortized post-regulatory approval, suggesting a capitalization and amortization strategy for long-term product development partnerships. Medtronic (MDT) highlights the risk of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments arising from patent litigation, reflecting a defensive posture where IP litigation exposure poses a material risk to product commercialization and profitability. Together, these perspectives show that while all three firms engage with royalty obligations, GILD emphasizes structured collaboration terms, JNJ integrates payments into asset amortization, and MDT frames royalty exposure as a litigation-driven liability.",

These arrangements may include non-refundable upfront payments, expense reimbursements or  payments  by  us  for  options  to  acquire  certain  rights,  contingent  obligations  by  us  for  potential  development  and  regulatory milestone payments and/or sales-based milestone payments, royalty payments, revenue or profit-sharing arrangements and costsharing  arrangements.  We  also  have  equity  investments  in  third  parties  focused  on  the  development  and  commercialization  of products and product candidates.",

The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The lease liability was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in 2021and 2020, respectively. The operating lease costs were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Product Liability\n\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\n\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company's operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\n\n",

The U.S. FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing  and  selling  our  products  and  limit  our  ability  to  obtain  future  pre-market  clearances  or  approvals,  and  could  result  in  a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Furthermore, we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information  from  state  and  federal  governmental  agencies,  and  while  these  investigations  typically  relate  primarily  to  financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices, we cannot predict the timing, outcome or impact of any such investigations. Any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative  remedies,  including  exclusion  from  government reimbursement programs and/or entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional, costly compliance obligations. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling, and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.\n\nGovernmental regulations in the U.S. and outside the U.S. are constantly changing and may become increasingly stringent. In the European Union, for example, the Medical Device Regulation which became effective in May 2021 includes significant additional pre-market and post-market  requirements.  Penalties  for  regulatory  non-compliance  could  be  severe,  including  fines  and  revocation  or  suspension  of  a company's business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions. The development and implementation of future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nOur devices, products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care  plans,  for  the  healthcare  services  provided  to  their  patients. The  ability  of  our  customers  to  obtain  appropriate  reimbursement  for products  and  services  from  third-party  payers  is  critical  because  it  affects  which  products  customers  purchase  and  the  prices  they  are willing to pay. As a result, our devices, products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by HHS, including the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health are goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers. In certain circumstances, insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.\n\nWe are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies, and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the U.S. and around the world. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems, could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.\n\nWe are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related  to  our  rights  or  the  rights  of  others  may  result  in  our  payment  of  significant  monetary  damages  and/or  royalty  payments, negatively impacting our ability to sell current or future products.\n\nWe  are  substantially  dependent  on  patent  and  other  proprietary  rights  and  rely  on  a  combination  of  patents,  trademarks,  tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and agreements (such as employee, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements) to protect our business and proprietary intellectual property. We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or that enforcement actions to protect our patent and proprietary rights against others could be unsuccessful, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our",

Financial assets for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient include equity and fixed income commingled trusts, partnership units, and registered investment companies.\n\nRevenue  Recognition The Company sells its products through direct sales representatives and independent distributors. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals and royalty and intellectual property arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue when control  is  transferred  to  the  customer.  For  products  sold  through  direct  sales  representatives  and  independent  distributors,  control  is  typically  transferred  upon shipment or upon delivery, based on the contract terms and legal requirements. For consignment inventory, control is transferred when the product is used or implanted. Payment terms vary depending on the country of sale, type of customer, and type of product.\n\nIf a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price. Shipping and handling is treated as a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service, and therefore, is not considered a performance obligation. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on, and concurrent with, a specific revenue producing transaction and collected by the Company from customers (for example, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes) are not included in revenue. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Company uses the practical ex pedient applicable to such contracts and does not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money.\n\nThe amount of revenue recognized reflects sales rebates and returns, which are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, the Company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim, the stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. The Company records adjustments to rebates and returns reserves as increases or decreases of revenue.\n\nThe Company records a deferred revenue liability if a customer pays consideration, or the Company has the right to invoice, before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer. Deferred revenue primarily represents remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance, for which consideration is received at the same time as consideration for the device or equipment. Revenue related to remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance is recognized over the service period as time elapses.\n\nShipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred to physically move product from the Company's premises to the customer's premises are recognized in selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income and were $341 million, $351 million, and $354 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022,  respectively.  Other  shipping  and  handling  costs  incurred  to  store,  move,  and  prepare  products  for  shipment  are  recognized  in cost  of  products  sold in  the consolidated statements of income.\n\nResearch and Development Research and development costs are expensed when incurred. Research and development costs include costs of research, engineering, and technical activities to develop a new product or service or make significant improvement to an existing product or manufacturing process. Research and development costs also include pre-approval regulatory and clinical trial ex penses and license payments for technology not yet approved by regulators.\n\nContingencies The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed.\n\nIncome Taxes The Company has deferred taxes that arise as a result of the different treatment of transactions for U.S. GAAP and income tax accounting, known as temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years for which the Company has already recognized the tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income. The Company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax  ex pense for which payment has been deferred or ex pense has already been taken as a deduction on the Company's tax return but has not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income. See Footnote 13 for more information on the Company's uncertain tax positions and tax policies.\n\nOther Operating E xpense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net primarily includes royalty expense, currency remeasurement and derivative gains and losses, Puerto Rico excise taxes, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, certain",

Bristol-Myers Squibb expanded its neuroscience capabilities via the 2024 acquisition of Karuna, RayzeBio, and Mirati, aligning with its broader strategy to become a leader in core therapeutic areas including neuroscience. Eli Lilly internally focuses on neuroscience as one of its key therapeutic areas, investing in discovery, development, and external collaborations to advance its pipeline, which includes new uses and formulations of existing products. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies prioritize neuroscience, their approaches vary from acquisition-driven expansion (AbbVie, BMS) to internal R&D and strategic partnerships (LLY).",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company). This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" This section of Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## Company Overview\n\nAbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has l eadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to i nnovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel Therapeutics). The acquisition complements AbbVie's neuroscience portfolio, adding a wide range of potentially best-in-class assets that may transform standards of care across psychiatric and neurological disorders where significant unmet needs remain for patients. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Cerevel Therapeutics.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, Robert A. Michael, AbbVie's then President and Chief Operating Officer, succeeded Richard A. Gonzalez as the company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Mr. Gonzalez, who has served as CEO since the company's formation in 2013, retired from the role of CEO and became Executive Chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2024. Additionally, the board has appointed Mr. Michael as a member of the board of directors effective July 1, 2024. On February 13, 2025, the board of directors of AbbVie unanimously elected Mr. Michael to succeed Mr. Gonzalez as Chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2025, at which time Mr. Gonzalez will retire from the board.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen). The acquisition of ImmunoGen further builds on AbbVie's existing solid tumor pipeline of novel targeted therapies and next-generation immuno-oncology assets, which have the potential to create new treatment possibilities across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. AbbVie and ImmunoGen's combined capabilities represent an opportunity to deliver potentially transformative antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapies to patients. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of ImmunoGen.\n\nAbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and i ndependent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 55,000 employees.\n\n## 33 | 2024 Form 10-K",

BUSINESS.\n\n## General\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (\"we\", the \"Company\", or \"BMS\") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1933 under the name BristolMyers Company, as successor to a New Y ork business started in 1887. In 1989, Bristol-Myers Company changed its name to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company as a result of a merger.\n\nWe operate in one segment engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of biopharmaceutical products on a global basis. Our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. Our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular, neuroscience and other areas where we can also deliver attractive returns for shareholders. Our priorities are to focus on transformational medicines where we have a competitive advantage, drive operational excellence and strategically allocate capital for long-term growth and shareholder returns.  For a further discussion of our strategy initiatives, refer to 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Strategy.' In addition, we expect that our acquisitions  of  Karuna,  RayzeBio  and  Mirati  in  2024  will  allow  us  to  ex pand  in  neuroscience  and  oncology,  and  continue  to  position  us  as  a  leading biopharmaceutical company across our core therapeutic areas.\n\nWe compete with other global research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies and generic drug manufacturers. Our products are sold worldwide, primarily to wholesalers, distributors, specialty pharmacies, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. We have significant manufacturing operations in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe percentage of revenues by significant region/country were as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "Our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of immunology, metabolism (including diabetes, obesity and cardiov ascular), neuroscience, and oncology. In addition to discov ering and dev eloping new medicines, we seek to expand the v alue of existing products through new uses, formulations, and therapeutic approaches, including complementary deliv ery dev ices or diagnostic tools, that can prov ide additional v alue to patients.\n\nTo supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others, including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and other organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiv eness of our medicines. We also inv est in external research and technologies that we believ e complement and strengthen our own efforts. These inv estments can take many forms, including, among others, licensing arrangements, co-dev elopment agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint v entures, acquisitions, and equity inv estments.\n\nPharmaceutical development is time-consuming, expensiv e, and risky. Very few of the candidates discov ered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines. The process from discov ery to regulatory approv al can take ov er a decade. Candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage candidates sometimes fail to receiv e regulatory approv al or achiev e commercial success. In addition, nov el modalities can present more challenging or lengthy dev elopment timelines. The following describes in more detail the research and dev elopment process for pharmaceutical products:\n\n## Phases of New Drug Development\n\n## \u00b7 Discovery Phase\n\nIn the discov ery phase, scientists identify, design, and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets considered to play a role in disease. Targets are often unprov en and only candidates that are expected to hav e the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria mov e to the next phase of dev elopment, which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans. The discov ery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low.\n\n## \u00b7 Early Development Phase\n\nEarly dev elopment includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements. Safety testing is initially performed in laboratory tests and animals, as necessary. In general, the first human tests (often referred to as Phase 1) are conducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and ev aluate the potential dosing range. Subsequently, larger populations of patients are studied (Phase 2) to identify signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety. In parallel, scientists work to identify safe, effectiv e, and economical manufacturing processes. Long-term animal studies may continue to test for potential safety issues. Of the candidates that enter the early dev elopment phase, only a fraction mov e to the late dev elopment phase. The early dev elopment phase v aries but can take sev eral years to complete.\n\n## \u00b7 Late Development Phase\n\nLate phase dev elopment projects (typically Phase 3) hav e met initial safety requirements and shown initial ev idence of efficacy in earlier studies. As a result, these candidates generally hav e a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the candidate in treating the disease. These studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitiv e therapies, placebo, or both. Phase 3 studies are generally conducted globally, are costly, and are designed to support regulatory filings for marketing approv al. The duration of Phase 3 testing v aries by disease and may take years.\n\n## \u00b7 Submission Phase\n\nOnce a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies, the time to final marketing approv al can v ary from sev eral months to sev eral years, depending on the disease state, the strength and complexity of av ailable data, the degree of unmet need, and the time required for the regulatory agency(ies) to ev aluate the submission, which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors. There is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receiv e marketing approv al, or that decisions on marketing approv als or indications will be consistent across geographic areas.\n\nSee Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Executive Overv iew-Clinical Dev elopment Pipeline,\" for more details about our current product pipeline.",

      "question": "How do Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Pfizer each approach the financial burden of R&D costs, and what does this reveal about their respective risk tolerance and strategic prioritization of innovation?",
      "answer": "Amgen demonstrates a shared-cost model with external partners like Kyowa Kirin, where it splits global development costs equally (except in Japan) and may pay up to $850 million in milestone payments. It also receives reimbursements and pays royalties, indicating a collaborative but financially exposed strategy. Bristol-Myers Squibb expenses R&D as incurred and presents it net of reimbursements from alliance partners, suggesting a more internally controlled approach with a focus on in-licensing and milestone-driven investment. Pfizer highlights the rising costs of product development and regulatory complexity, noting that these factors constrain its ability to fund candidates and maintain a sustainable R&D portfolio, pointing to a cautious, risk-aware stance on innovation investment. Together, these perspectives show that while all three firms face rising R&D costs, their strategies for managing these costs differ significantly\u2014ranging from Amgen\u2019s partnership-heavy model to BMS\u2019s milestone-based in-licensing to Pfizer\u2019s more risk-averse portfolio management.",

DHR notes that R&D investments are sensitive to external pressures such as regulatory hurdles, reimbursement uncertainty, and pricing pressures from government policies like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In contrast, GILD emphasizes a focused internal and externally supported R&D strategy targeting high unmet medical needs in viral diseases, cancer, and inflammation, with extensive outsourcing of clinical trials to manage costs. Together, this reveals that BMY is managing R&D risk through portfolio consolidation despite debt constraints, DHR is navigating regulatory and reimbursement headwinds, and GILD is leveraging external partnerships to sustain innovation with controlled investment.",

          "chunk_text": "stage pipeline, manage change from our operating model evolution or manage our costs effectively, our operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\n\nAdditionally, future revenues, profits and cash flows of an acquired company' s products, technologies and pipeline candidates may not materialize due to low product uptake, delayed or missed pipeline opportunities, the inability to capture expected synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance, increased competition, safety concerns, regulatory issues, supply chain problems or other factors beyond our control. Substantial difficulties, costs and delays could result from integrating our acquisitions, including for: (i) R&amp;D, manufacturing, distribution, sales, marketing, promotion and information technology activities; (ii) policies, procedures, processes, controls and compliance; and (iii) tax considerations.\n\nWhere we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities, such as in connection with a joint venture or acquisition, the value of those securities will fluctuate and may depreciate in value. W e may not control the company in which we acquire securities, such as in connection with a collaborative arrangement, and as a result, we will have limited ability to determine its management, operational decisions, internal controls and compliance and other policies, which can result in additional financial and reputational risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets, and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. Our divestitures also may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial  arrangements,  continued  supply  and  services  arrangements,  or  potential  litigation,  following  the  transaction.  Under  these  arrangements, nonperformance by us could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition or reputation.\n\nWe might also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our earnings. The value allocated to certain of our assets could be substantially impaired due to a number of factors beyond our control. New or revised accounting standards, rules and interpretations could result in changes to the recognition of income and expense that may materially and adversely affect our financial results.\n\nIf the execution or implementation of acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful, it could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Moreover, due to the substantial amount of debt that we incurred to finance the cash portion of the Celgene,  MyoKardia,  Mirati,  Karuna  and  RayzeBio  acquisitions,  there  can  be  no  assurance  of  when  we  will  be  able  to  expand  our  business  development capacity. Although we are committed to reducing our debt, pursuing strategic transaction opportunities in the future may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, and could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings.\n\n## Failure to attract and retain a highly qualified workforce could affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize products.\n\nOur success is largely dependent on our continued ability to (i) attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management workforce, including people  with  expertise  in  clinical  R&amp;D,  governmental  regulation  and  commercialization,  and  (ii)  in  connection  with  our  acquisitions,  integrate  corporate cultures and maintain employee morale. W e are facing increasing competition for a limited pool of qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, government entities, research institutions, companies seeking to enter the healthcare space, and companies in other industries.  Additionally, we periodically adjust our personnel needs in response to changing macroeconomic conditions, market opportunities, management changes, acquisitions, cost levels and other internal and external considerations, which may adversely impact our workplace culture and ability to retain and incentivize employees. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain quality talent or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.\n\n## Market, Liquidity and Credit Risks\n\n## We have significant indebtedness that could have negative consequences .\n\nOur acquisitions of Celgene, MyoKardia, Mirati, Karuna and RayzeBio increased the amount of our debt resulting in additional interest expense, and we may incur more debt to finance future acquisitions. This could reduce our financial flexibility to continue capital investments, develop new products and declare future dividends. For example, following the December 2023 announcements of previous acquisitions, Standard &amp; Poor' s downgraded BMS' s long term-credit rating from A+ to A (with a stable long-term credit outlook).\n\n## Adverse changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\n\nGlobal  economic  and  political  risks  pose  significant  challenges  to  a  company' s  growth  and  profitability  and  are  difficult  to  mitigate.  W e  generated approximately 29% of our revenues outside of the U.S. in 2024. As such, a global economic downturn could create or amplify a variety of risks to our business and could negatively affect our growth. In addition, uncertainty in the credit and capital",

Ev en when we successfully innov ate and dev elop new and enhanced products and serv ices, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceiv ed efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achiev e positiv e clinical outcomes, uncertainty ov er third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market serv ices and parts for our products which may detract from our sales.\n\nThe healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, which can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nThe healthcare industry and related industries that we serv e hav e undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, including the following:\n\n- Many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on gov ernment funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and serv ices and research activ ities. The PPACA, healthcare austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and gov ernment austerity measures hav e reduced and may further reduce the amount of gov ernment funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and serv ices and/or the v olume of medical procedures using our products and serv ices. For example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 ('PAMA') introduced a multi-year pricing program for serv ices payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule ('CLFS') that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by priv ate payors. It is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect ov erall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing serv ices, but to the extent our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these serv ices is inadequate, it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains v arious drug price negotiation, inflationary rebate and gov ernment-established pricing prov isions with v arying implementation dates and subjects manufacturers who fail to adhere to the gov ernment's interpretation of the law to penalties. The recent change in U.S. administration may also result in changes that unfav orably impact the healthcare industry and our business.\n- Other countries, as well as some priv ate payors, also control the price of healthcare products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or cov erage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of gov ernmental entities) through compulsory licensing or limiting of intellectual property protections. For example, China has introduced programs designed to lower prices for medical products and reduce healthcare costs (including a v olume-based procurement program) that hav e unfav orably impacted our rev enues and may continue to adv ersely affect our business and financial statements. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adv ersely impact government funding and reimbursement.\n- Governmental and priv ate healthcare prov iders and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the deliv ery of healthcare serv ices, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of v endors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations, strategic alliances and integrated health deliv ery networks and pursuing consolidation to improv e their purchasing lev erage, using competitiv e bid processes to procure healthcare products and serv ices and inv esting in healthcare practices to increase their control ov er healthcare spending. Payors are also seeking to improv e price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increases.\n\nThese changes as well as other impacts from market demand, gov ernment regulations, third-party cov erage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is deliv ered, reimbursed and funded and hav e in the past and could in the future cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serv e to purchase fewer of our products and serv ices, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or serv ices, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding av ailable for our products and serv ices from gov ernmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the v olume of medical procedures that use our products and serv ices, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and ev en if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negativ ely affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described abov e can adv ersely affect our business and financial statements.",

Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues\n\nWe also generate revenues from other activities, including royalties for outbound licenses of our intellectual property and other payments received from our collaborations with third-party partners.\n\n## Commercialization and Distribution\n\nWe have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in more than 35 countries. Our products are marketed through our commercial teams and/or in conjunction with third-party wholesalers, distributors and corporate partners. Our commercial teams promote our products through direct field contact with physicians, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare providers. We generally grant our third-party distributors the exclusive right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. Most of our agreements with these distributors provide for collaborative efforts between the distributor and G ilead in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the product in the specified territory.\n\nWe sell and distribute most of our products in the U.S. exclusively through the wholesale channel. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 91% of our product sales in the U.S. and approximately 65% of our total worldwide revenues were from three large wholesalers: Cardinal Health, Inc., Cencora, Inc. and McKesson Corporation, and their specialty distributor affiliates. We sell and distribute our products in Europe and countries outside the U.S. where the product is approved, either through our commercial teams, third-party distributors or corporate partners.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe operate  in  a  highly  competitive  environment.  Our  products  compete  with  other  commercially  available  products  based  primarily  on  efficacy,  safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease of use, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, distribution and marketing. We also face significant competition from: (i) large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialized pharmaceutical firms acting either independently or together with other such companies to pursue the development of products and technologies that may be competitive with our existing products or research programs; (ii) academic  institutions,  government  agencies  and  other  public  and  private  organizations  conducting  research  who  may  seek  patent  protection  or  may  establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs; (iii) pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers as our products mature, which often result in a reduction of the net product prices; and (iv) new branded or generic products introduced into major markets, which may impact our ability to maintain pricing and market share.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  'We  face  significant  competition  from  global  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology  companies,  specialized pharmaceutical firms and generic drug manufacturers.'\n\n## Research and Development\n\nOur research and development ('R&amp;D') mission is to discover and develop transformational therapies in areas of high unmet medical need.  Our product development efforts are focused primarily on viral diseases, cancer and inflammatory diseases. Our team of research scientists is engaged in the discovery and development of new molecules and technologies that we hope will lead to the approval of innovative medicines and therapies that will transform care for people around the world.  We have committed significant resources to internal  R&amp;D opportunities and external business development activity to drive innovation and growth of our business. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of start-up activities in-house. We rely on thirdparty contract research organizations to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training, program management, patient enrollment, ongoing monitoring, site management and bioanalysis.\n\nThe development of product candidates and investigational therapies in our pipeline is subject to various risks and uncertainties that could result in delays or prevent completion of the development and approval of our product candidates. For more information about these risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A. Risk Factors 'We face risks in our clinical trials, including the potential for unfavorable results, delays in anticipated timelines and disruption.' Drug development is inherently risky, and many product candidates and investigational therapies fail during the development process.\n\nIn 2024, we continued to invest in and advance our R&amp;D pipeline across our therapeutic areas.

      "answer": "Gilead Sciences (GILD) emphasizes that its forward-looking statements are based on current expectations involving risks such as operating cost and revenue trends, collaboration and licensing arrangements, and litigation matters. Medtronic (MDT) highlights a broad range of forward-looking topics, including growth strategies, regulatory approvals, AI integration, and restructuring initiatives, noting that these are subject to risks like supply chain disruptions, regulatory delays, and litigation. Pfizer (PFE) focuses on competitive pressures from generics and biosimilars, particularly noting how patent expirations and market competition may adversely affect future results. Synthesizing these, GILD focuses on internal R&D and collaboration risks, MDT on operational and technological shifts, and PFE on external market and regulatory competition, revealing differing strategic exposures to forward-looking financial risks.",

      "question": "How do AbbVie, Danaher, and Thermo Fisher Scientific each quantify or describe their exposure to environmental liabilities, and what does this reveal about the variation in risk management approaches across the healthcare sector?",
      "answer": "AbbVie notes that environmental liabilities are among the many factors that could materially affect its profitability and financial condition, particularly due to its manufacturing processes and distribution logistics involving hazardous materials. Danaher highlights that its operations expose it to environmental, health, and safety liabilities, including remediation costs and potential claims from private parties, though it states that these liabilities are not expected to materially affect its business or financial statements. Thermo Fisher Scientific discloses $65 million in accrued liabilities for environmental matters as of December 31, 2021, and details specific remediation efforts at multiple sites, including the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site and the Davis Landfill Superfund site. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies face environmental liability risks, their quantification and disclosure practices differ significantly, reflecting varied risk management strategies and levels of transparency.",

          "chunk_text": "## Failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could affect AbbVie's ability to successfully develop and commercialize products.\n\nAbbVie's success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract, develop and retain diverse, highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development (R&amp;D), governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. AbbVie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.\n\n## Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.\n\nMany other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:\n\n- changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, data privacy laws, particularly in the European Union and the United States, and environmental laws;\n- differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;\n- changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts;\n- changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts;\n- environmental liabilities in connection with AbbVie's manufacturing processes and distribution logistics, including the handling of hazardous materials;\n- changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie;\n- business interruptions stemming from natural disasters, such as climate change, earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, fires, or efforts taken by third parties to prevent or mitigate such disasters; and\n- changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups.\n\n## Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock\n\n## AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock.\n\nAlthough AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5, \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future.\n\n## An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future.\n\nIn the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans.",

          "chunk_text": "## Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.\n\nThe FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products. In particular, any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the intended uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA or any other federal, state or non-U.S. regulator determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we can be subject to exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled 'Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.' Any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial statements.\n\n## Certain modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products.\n\nOnce a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the United States pursuant to a 510(k) clearance or a premarket approval ('PMA'), a manufacturer may be required to notify the FDA of certain modifications to the device (similar requirements apply in other jurisdictions). Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket submission, but the FDA may review any manufacturer's decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new clearance or approval. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMA applications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation.\n\n## Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nOur operations, products and services are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, chemical constituents in products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for products sold. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) have been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws can result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or financial statements.\n\nIn addition, we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We can also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we have as of the date of this Annual Report we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2021, will have a material effect on our business or financial statements.\n\n## Changes in governmental regulations can reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.\n\nWe compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs and privacy. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These",

          "chunk_text": "## Business (continued)\n\n## Government Regulation\n\n## Environmental Regulations\n\nWe are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.\n\nIn addition to these federal laws and regulations, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes and have authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.\n\nA number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.\n\nOur expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters. Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material. For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwatertreatment systems and other remedial measures.\n\nOur Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State's Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program. As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the USEPA to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study. In 2018, the USEPA issued a Record of Decision, setting forth the scope of required remediation work at the site, which includes upgrading a water treatment plant to address constituents such as chlorinated organic compounds, 1,4-dioxane, and perfluorooctanoic acid/perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOA/PFOS). In 2020, the court approved a consent decree that requires the company and another responsible party to finance and perform the required remediation work with USEPA oversight.\n\nIn 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island. After years of additional study, in September, 2020, USEPA revised its cleanup plan by selecting an interim remedial approach that includes groundwater treatment followed by additional monitoring of site conditions. Depending on the results of these treatment and monitoring activities over the next several years, USEPA anticipates selecting a final groundwater remedy for the site. In November 2021, the 2011 consent decree was amended to reflect the parties' obligations to implement USEPA's interim remedy.\n\nWe record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management's knowledge and experience with these environmental matters. We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites. Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $65 million at December 31, 2021.\n\nThese environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled. We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur. As a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that the Company's operations, products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies, refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies.\n\n## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.",

      "answer": "In 2023, BMY reported a pension and postretirement benefits component of $(115) million as part of its Total Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss), indicating a negative impact. LLY disclosed a pension-related actuarial loss of $(763.9) million, which was the dominant component of its Total Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) for the year. TMO, on the other hand, reported pension and postretirement benefit liability adjustments of $(69) million for 2023.

      "question": "How do CVS, LLY, and PFE each characterize their exposure to integration costs, and what does this reveal about their respective strategic priorities and financial impacts in 2022?",
      "answer": "CVS discusses integration costs in the context of forward-looking statements, highlighting that such costs are among the uncertainties that could materially affect its future operating performance. LLY notes integration costs as part of the broader risks associated with acquisitions and business development, indicating that these costs are a known but uncertain component of its strategic growth initiatives. PFE provides concrete figures, disclosing $41 million in integration costs in 2022, which is part of a broader set of acquisition-related expenses. Together, these perspectives show that while CVS and LLY treat integration costs as strategic risk factors, PFE offers quantifiable exposure, suggesting a more active integration phase in its operations.",

In particular, information appearing under \"Business,\" \"Risk Factors,\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\" includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and generally can be identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"plan,\" \"continue,\" or similar expressions or future or conditional verbs.\n\nForward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, it is based on management's current plans and expectations, expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, we can give no assurance that any such expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or accomplished. Investors therefore should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The following include some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:\n\n- the impact of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic, epidemic, or similar public health threat and the global response thereto;\n- uncertainties related to our efforts to develop, manufacture, and distribute potential treatments for COVID-19;\n- the significant costs and uncertainties in the pharmaceutical research and development process, including with respect to the timing and process of obtaining regulatory approvals;\n- the impact and outcome of acquisitions and business development transactions and related integration costs;\n- the expiration of intellectual property protection for certain of our products and competition from generic and/or biosimilar products;\n- our ability to protect and enforce patents and other intellectual property;\n- changes in patent law or regulations related to data package exclusivity;\n- competitive developments affecting current products and our pipeline;\n- market uptake of recently launched products;\n- information technology system inadequacies, breaches, or operating failures;\n- unauthorized access, disclosure, misappropriation, or compromise of confidential information or other data stored in our information technology systems, networks, and facilities, or those of third parties with whom we share our data;\n- unexpected safety or efficacy concerns associated with our products;\n- litigation, investigations, or other similar proceedings involving past, current, or future products or commercial activities as we are largely self-insured;\n- issues with product supply and regulatory approvals stemming from manufacturing difficulties, disruptions, or shortages, including as a result of demand, labor shortages, third-party performance, or regulatory actions relating to our facilities;\n- reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements;\n- regulatory changes or other developments;\n- regulatory actions regarding currently marketed products;\n- continued pricing pressures and the impact of actions of governmental and private payers affecting pricing of, reimbursement for, and access to pharmaceuticals;\n- devaluations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and inflation;\n- changes in tax law, tax rates, or events that differ from our assumptions related to tax positions;\n- asset impairments and restructuring charges;",

      "question": "How do ABBV, AMGN, and MDT each approach business acquisitions as a strategic lever, and what does this reveal about their differing priorities in capital allocation?",
      "answer": "ABBV reports no acquisitions in 2023, with a net cash outflow of $2,009 million in investing activities, primarily directed toward other acquisitions and investments, property and equipment, and investment securities. This suggests a focus on internal growth and portfolio optimization rather than large-scale acquisitions. In contrast, AMGN highlights that adverse capital and credit market conditions could limit its ability to fund business acquisitions, indicating that external financing constraints are a key risk to its M&A strategy. MDT explicitly states that its capital allocation strategy includes 'acquiring businesses and technology' as part of its liquidity and capital resources planning, showing a proactive stance toward acquisitions as a component of long-term growth. Together, this reveals that while all three companies consider acquisitions relevant, ABBV is less active, AMGN is cautious due to financing risks, and MDT is strategically prioritizing M&A as part of its innovation and expansion efforts.",

      "answer": "Abbott (ABT) completed two acquisitions in 2023\u2014Bigfoot and CSI\u2014with the latter valued at $851 million, indicating a targeted approach to expanding its vascular device portfolio. Amgen (AMGN) faced challenges due to its acquisition of Horizon, which significantly increased its debt and constrained its ability to pursue further acquisitions in the short term. Danaher (DHR) used cash for acquisitions and share repurchases in 2024, which led to a decline in interest income by $186 million compared to 2023, showing a continued reliance on M&A as part of its capital deployment strategy. Together, these approaches highlight differing M&A strategies: Abbott's focused integration, Amgen's post-acquisition deleveraging, and Danaher's consistent capital allocation to acquisitions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAbbott declared dividends of $2.24 per share in 2024 compared to $2.08 per share in 2023, an increase of 7.7 percent. Dividends paid were $3.8 billion in 2024 compared to $3.6 billion in 2023. The year-over-year change in dividends paid reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate.\n\n## Working Capital\n\nWorking capital was $9.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and $8.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital in 2024 primarily reflects an increase in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  accounts  receivable,  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  the  current  portion  of  long-term  debt.  The  increase  in  cash  and  cash equivalents from $6.9 billion at  December 31, 2023 to $7.6 billion at  December 31, 2024 primarily reflects the cash generated from operations and an increase in Abbott's yen-denominated loan, partially offset by the payment of dividends and capital expenditures.\n\nAbbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances.\n\n## Capital E xpenditures\n\nCapital expenditures of $2.2 billion in 2024 and 2023, and $1.8 billion in 2022 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers.\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nAbbott believes that its available cash and cash equivalents along with its ability to generate operating cash flow and continued access to debt markets are sufficient to fund ex isting and planned cash requirements. Abbott's material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\n\nDebt - Principal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 are $1.5 billion in 2025, $2.9 billion in 2026, $617 million in 2027, $650 million  in  2028,  $583  million  in  2029  and  $8.0  billion  in  2030  and  thereafter.  Interest  payments  required  on  long-term  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2024  are projected to be $512 million in 2025, $478 million in 2026, $396 million in 2027, $390 million in 2028, $384 million in 2029 and $4.7 billion in 2030 and thereafter.\n\nOperating leases - As of December 31, 2024, estimated contractual obligations for operating lease payments were $1.3 billion, with $290 million due within 12 months.\n\nIn addition, Abbott enters into purchase commitments in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. The majority of outstanding purchase commitments generally do not extend past one year.\n\n## Contingent Obligations\n\nAbbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Business Acquisitions\n\nOn September 22, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of  Bigfoot, which furthers Abbott's efforts  to  develop  connected  solutions  for  making  diabetes management more personal and precise. The purchase price, the final allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Bigfoot since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\n\nOn April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of CSI for $20 per common share, which equated to a purchase price of $851 million. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and accounted for as a business combination. CSI's atherectomy system, which is used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease, adds complementary technologies to Abbott's portfolio of vascular device offerings.",

          "chunk_text": "In response to the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine, the U.S. government, numerous state governments, the EU and other countries in which we conduct business have  imposed  a  wide  range  of  economic  sanctions  that  restrict  commerce  and  business  dealings  with  Russia,  certain  regions  of  Ukraine  and  certain  entities  and individuals. Additionally, the recent armed conflict in the Middle East has caused regional disruptions to economic activity. For a description of the conflict's impact on our third-party contract manufacturing of KRYSTEXXA, see Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions . These conflicts may also precipitate or amplify the other risks described herein, including risks relating to cybersecurity, global economic conditions, clinical trials and supply chains, which could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition and results.\n\nAs we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. Overall, the legal and operational challenges of our international business operations, along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products, may result in material adverse effects on our international product sales, business and results of operations.\n\nWe may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\n\nThe capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. For example, in early 2020, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper market and several borrowers were unable to obtain funding at normal rates or maturities, which resulted in a significant increase in draws of corporate credit lines with banks. Similarly, the bond markets experienced extreme volatility in terms of interest rates and credit spreads, with several days without new issuances of corporate bonds.\n\nWhile  we  have  historically  accessed  capital  markets  to  supplement  our  ex isting  funds  and  cash  generated  from  operations  to  satisfy  our  needs  for  capital expenditures, debt service requirements, to pay dividends and repurchase stock, and engage in other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities, in 2023, we substantially increased our outstanding indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of Horizon, which may limit our ability to timely obtain additional financing on desired terms. See Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions . While we have reduced, and plan to continue to reduce, our debt leverage levels before returning to the capital or credit markets for new funds, if we are required to access the capital and credit markets at an inopportune time, including when adverse capital and credit market conditions prevail, we may be unable to obtain financing  on  favorable  terms,  or  at  all,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business  and  results  of  operations  or  our  ability  to  complete  business acquisitions. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could also adversely affect our ability to obtain capital and credit market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION\n\nOur products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. We expect that our products and product candidates will compete with existing drugs, new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products have expanded into, and are expected to continue expanding into, the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. With the proliferation of companies pursuing biopharmaceuticals, several of our biosimilar products have entered, and a number of our product candidates may enter, markets with one or more competitors or with competitors soon to arrive. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. As a result, our products have been competing and may continue to compete, and our product candidates may compete, against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent or superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive",

Interest income of $117 million for 2024 was $186 million lower than in 2023, due to lower av erage cash balances in 2024 primarily as a result of the use of cash for share repurchases and acquisitions.\n\nFor a further description of the Company's debt and cross-currency swap deriv ativ e contracts related to the debt as of December 31, 2024 refer to Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n## General\n\nIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.\n\nThe Company's effectiv e tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the v aluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of prev iously filed tax returns (as further discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities, changes in tax laws and regulations, and legislativ e policy changes that may result from the OECD's initiativ e on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinv ested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to '-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Cash and Cash Requirements' below.\n\nThe amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these rev iews, which take into account the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the other factors referenced in the prior paragraph, reserv es for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary.

Examples of qualitative factors assessed include BMS's share price, financial performance compared to budgets, long-term financial plans, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions as well as the substantial excess of fair value over the carrying value of net assets from the annual impairment test performed in a prior year. Each relevant factor is assessed both individually and in the aggregate.\n\nIPRD is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying value. Impairment charges are recognized to the extent the carrying value of IPRD is determined to exceed its fair value.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nRestructuring charges are recognized as a result of actions to streamline operations, realize synergies from acquisitions and reduce the number of facilities. Estimating the impact of restructuring plans, including future termination benefits, integration expenses and other exit costs requires judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Restructuring charges are recognized upon meeting certain criteria, including finalization of committed plans, reliable estimates and discussions with local works councils in certain markets.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nLoss contingencies from legal proceedings and claims may occur from government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims, tax and other matters. Accruals are recognized when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies (including contingent proceeds related to the divestitures) are not recognized until realized. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRefer to '-Note 2. Revenue' for a detailed discussion of accounting policies related to revenue recognition, including deferred revenue and royalties. Refer to '-Note 3. Alliances' for further detail regarding alliances.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical study and certain research costs are recognized over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred.  Research  and  development  costs  are  presented  net  of  reimbursements  from  alliance  partners.  Up-front  and  contingent development milestone payments in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights are also included in research and development expense if there are no alternative future uses.\n\n## Advertising and Product Promotion Costs\n\nAdvertising  and  product  promotion  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.

We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation\n\n## We are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\n\nOur shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently  does  not  have  a  treaty  with  Ireland  providing  for  the  reciprocal  recognition  and  enforcement  of  judgments  in  civil  and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.\n\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable  to  U.S.  corporations  and  shareholders,  including,  among  others,  differences  relating  to  interested  director  and  officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in the U.S.\n\n## As  an  Irish  public  limited  company,  certain  capital  structure  decisions  require  shareholder  approval,  which  may  limit  Medtronic's flexibility to manage its capital structure.\n\nUnder Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution  of  our  shareholders.  Additionally,  subject  to  specified  exceptions,  Irish  law  grants  statutory  preemption  rights  to  existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution. Such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares. Accordingly, at our 2021 Annual General Meeting, our Shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 33% of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 10% of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders (provided that with respect to 5% of such shares, such allotment is to be used for the purposes of a specified capital investment). Both of these authorizations will expire on June 9, 2023, unless renewed by shareholders for a further period. We anticipate seeking new authorizations at our 2022 Annual General Meeting and in subsequent years. We cannot provide  any  assurance  that  these  authorizations  will  always  be  approved,  which  could  limit  our  ability  to  issue  equity  and  thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.\n\n## A transfer of our shares, other than ones effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, may be subject to Irish stamp duty.\n\nTransfers  of  our  shares  effected  by  means  of  the  transfer  of  book  entry  interests  in  the  Depository  Trust  Company  (DTC)  will  not  be subject to Irish stamp duty. However, if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired). Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of shares.\n\n## In certain limited circumstances, dividends we pay may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax.\n\nIn certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 25%) may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares. A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the U.S. and other specified countries that have a tax treaty with Ireland may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax.\n\nShareholders  resident  in  the  U.S.  that  hold  their  shares  through  DTC  will  not  be  subject  to  dividend  withholding  tax,  provided  the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers",

      "question": "How do CVS, Eli Lilly, and Thermo Fisher Scientific differ in their diluted earnings per share trends over the past three years, and what might this reveal about their respective financial performance and capital structure strategies?",
      "answer": "CVS saw a significant increase in diluted EPS from $6.02 in 2021 to $6.47 in 2023, despite a dip in 2022 ($3.26), indicating strong recovery and earnings growth. Eli Lilly experienced a decline in diluted EPS from $6.12 in 2021 to $5.80 in 2023, suggesting pressure on profitability despite consistent revenue growth. Thermo Fisher Scientific, in contrast, saw a steady decline in diluted EPS from $19.46 in 2021 to $15.45 in 2023, signaling potential challenges in maintaining earnings growth amid changing market conditions. These differences suggest varying degrees of success in managing net income and share dilution across the three healthcare firms.",

      "answer": "BMY reports that actuarial gains and losses primarily stem from changes in discount rates and revised mortality assumptions, with a weighted-average discount rate of 4.8% used in 2023. MDT notes that actuarial gains and losses are mainly driven by fluctuations in discount rates, following a pension freeze announcement effective in 2028. MRK discloses a pension plan net loss of $3.5 billion in 2023, highlighting the impact of actuarial gains and losses being amortized into net periodic benefit cost. Together, these disclosures indicate that all three companies are significantly affected by actuarial assumptions, though MDT's pension freeze suggests a strategic move to limit future exposure, while BMY and MRK continue to manage ongoing liabilities with sensitivity to interest rate changes.",

The effective income tax rates differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, tax audit settlements and accretion on contingent consideration. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes.\n\n## FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, differ from the federal statutory rate primarily due to  impacts  of  the  jurisdictional  mix  of  income  and  expenses.  Substantially  all  of  the  benefit  to  our  effective  tax  rate  from  foreign earnings results from the Company's operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for  U.S.  tax  purposes.  Our  operations  in  Puerto  Rico  are  subject  to  tax  incentive  grants  through  2035. Additionally,  the  Company's operations conducted in Singapore are subject to a tax incentive grant through 2034. Our foreign earnings are also subject to U.S. tax at a reduced rate of 10.5%.\n\nThe U.S. territory of Puerto Rico imposes an excise tax on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturing  site  in  Puerto  Rico.  The  rate  of  4%  is  effective  through  December  31,  2027.  We  account  for  the  excise  tax  as  a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in Cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes in 2021, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes when the excise tax is incurred.\n\nIncome taxes paid during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were $1.9 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.\n\nOne or more of our legal entities file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in those jurisdictions. Significant disputes may arise  with  tax  authorities  involving  issues  regarding  the  timing  and  amount  of  deductions,  the  use  of  tax  credits  and  allocations  of income and expenses among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws, regulations and relevant facts. Tax authorities (including the IRS) are becoming more aggressive and are particularly focused on such matters.\n\nIn  2017,  we  received  an  RAR  and  a  modified  RAR  from  the  IRS  for  the  years  2010,  2011  and  2012  proposing  significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Notices for 2010, 2011 and 2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income. The Notices seek to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax that could be imposed would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings. We firmly believe that the IRS's positions set forth in the Notices are without merit, and we are contesting the Notices through the judicial process.\n\nIn 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office. We were unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a statutory notice of deficiency for these years as well. We expect to contest any such notice related to 2013-15 through the judicial process. We are also currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 and by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.",

BMS operates under a favorable tax grant in Puerto Rico not scheduled to expire prior to 2023.\n\nInternal transfers of certain intangible and other assets to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the Celgene acquisition resulted in a tax benefit in 2021 and in a tax charge in 2020 upon adjusting deferred taxes for the book and revalued tax basis differences of the related assets.\n\nU.S. Federal, state and foreign contingent tax matters includes an $81 million tax benefit in 2019 with respect to lapse of statutes.\n\nFair value adjustments for contingent value rights are not taxable or tax deductible.\n\nNon-deductible R&amp;D charges primarily resulted from the $11.4 billion MyoKardia IPRD charge in 2020.\n\nPuerto Rico imposes an excise tax on the gross company purchase price of goods sold from BMS's manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is recognized in Cost of products sold when the intra-entity sale occurs. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax is  not  deductible  but  results  in  foreign  tax  credits  that  are  generally  recognized  in  BMS's  provision  for  income  taxes  when  the excise tax is incurred.",

      "question": "How do BMY, GILD, and JNJ each reflect the impact of non-operational income or expense items on their financial performance in 2024, and what does this reveal about their respective financial strategies and restructuring activities?",
      "answer": "In 2024, BMY reported 'Other (income)/expense, net' at $1,145 million, significantly influenced by litigation and restructuring charges. GILD recorded 'Other (income) expense, net' at $(6)$ million, indicating minor non-operational adjustments. JNJ reported 'Other (income) expense, net' at $1,092 million, alongside a significant $(20,984)$ million loss from the separation of Kenvue. These differences highlight BMY's focus on restructuring and litigation, GILD's relatively stable operations, and JNJ's strategic divestiture-driven transformation.",

PFE reports the service cost component as part of operating expenses, while other components are included in 'Other (income)/deductions--net', suggesting a more consolidated treatment of pension costs. TMO includes the service cost component in operating expenses on the statement of income, distinguishing it from other pension-related costs like currency transaction gains and losses, which are reported separately.

      "answer": "Abbott Laboratories reported $1,966 million in amortization of intangible assets in 2023, which is a significant operating expense that has slightly decreased over the past three years. Medtronic recorded $1,698 million in amortization expense for fiscal year 2023, showing relative stability compared to prior years, indicating consistent asset management. Pfizer, in contrast, reported a much higher amortization expense of $4,733 million in 2023, reflecting a notable increase and signaling substantial prior acquisitions.

CVS Health reports net assets of $643 million in 2023, derived from noncurrent assets and liabilities, suggesting a more modest net asset position relative to its liabilities. Thermo Fisher Scientific, through its acquisition activity, discloses net assets acquired across multiple deals, with a total of $16,036 million for the PPD acquisition alone, highlighting an aggressive growth-through-acquisition strategy. Together, these disclosures reflect differing strategic priorities: Amgen emphasizes asset transparency, CVS focuses on stable net asset management, and Thermo Fisher leverages acquisitions to expand its asset base.",

      "answer": "Amgen estimates sales returns by analyzing historical return data on a production lot basis, adjusting for known or expected market changes, and notes that returns historically amount to less than 1% of gross product sales. Gilead records allowances for estimated sales returns in the period revenue is recognized, based on historical return patterns, industry data for similar products, and contractual terms, and permits returns under specific conditions such as product damage or expiration. Eli Lilly, while not explicitly quantifying return rates, focuses on variable consideration and performance obligations, adjusting estimates only when actual facts become known, and generally avoids recognizing contingent payments tied to regulatory approval.

          "chunk_text": "## 1. Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Business\n\nAmgen Inc. (including its consolidated subsidiaries, referred to as 'Amgen,' 'the Company,' 'we,' 'our' or 'us') is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. We operate our business in one operating segment: human therapeutics. See Note 2, Segment and other information.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of Amgen  as  well  as  its  majority-owned  subsidiaries.  In  determining  whether  we  are  the  primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we consider whether we have both the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. We do not have any significant interests in any variable interest entities of which we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Product sales and sales deductions\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.\n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that an adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given period, can be affected by the mix of products sold. Included in sales deductions are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-period sales due to changes in estimates.\n\nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data with their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-period sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.\n\nOur payment terms vary by types and locations of customers and by products or services offered. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment is generally required in a term ranging from 30 to 120 days from date of shipment or satisfaction of the performance obligation. For certain products or services and certain customer types, we may require payment before products are delivered or services are rendered to customers.\n\nIndirect tax es collected from customers and remitted to government authorities that are related to sales of the Company's products, primarily in Europe, are excluded from revenues.\n\nAs a practical expedient, sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in SG&amp;A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## AMGEN INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## December 31, 2024",

          "chunk_text": "## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Product Sales\n\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when control of the product transfers to the customer, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, or in certain cases, upon the corresponding sales by our customer to a third party. Revenues are recognized net of estimated rebates and chargebacks, patient co-pay assistance, prompt pay discounts, distributor fees, sales return provisions and other related deductions. These deductions to product sales are referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. Our payment terms to customers generally range from 30 to 90 days; however, payment terms differ by jurisdiction, by customer and, in some instances, by type of product. Revenues from product sales, net of gross-to-net deductions, are recorded only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized is not probable of occurring when the uncertainty associated with gross-to-net deductions is subsequently resolved. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers are excluded from product sales. If we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of control and corresponding payment from the customer will be one year or less,  we  do  not  adjust  the  amount  of  consideration  for  the  effects  of  a  financing  component.  Shipping  and  handling  activities  are  considered  to  be  fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\n## Rebates and Chargebacks\n\nRebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements and include amounts due to payers and healthcare providers under various programs. These amounts may vary by product, payer and individual plans. Providers qualified under certain programs can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a discount. The wholesalers or distributors then charge the discount back to us.\n\nRebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, including product mix and pricing, historical and estimated payer mix and discount rates, among other inputs, which require significant estimates and judgment. We assess and update our estimates each reporting period to reflect actual claims and other current information.\n\nChargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are generally classified as reductions of Accounts receivable on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets. Rebates that are payable to third party payers and healthcare providers are recorded in Accrued rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Patient Co-Pay Assistance\n\nCo-pay assistance represents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them with prescription drug co-payments required by insurance. Our accrual for co-pay is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end.\n\n## Cash Discounts\n\nWe estimate  cash  discounts  based  on  contractual  terms,  historical  customer  payment  patterns  and  our  ex pectations  regarding  future  customer  payment patterns.\n\n## Distributor Fees\n\nUnder  our  inventory  management  agreements  with  our  significant  U.S.  wholesalers,  we  pay  the  wholesalers  a  fee  primarily  for  compliance  with  certain contractually-determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed-upon inventory levels. These distributor fees are based on a contractually-determined fixed percentage of sales.\n\n## Allowance for Sales Returns\n\nAllowances are made for estimated sales returns by our customers and are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. We typically permit returns if the product is damaged, defective, or otherwise cannot be used by the customer. In the U.S., we typically permit returns six months prior to and up to one year after the product expiration date. Outside the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\n\nOur estimates of sales returns are based primarily on analysis of our historical product return patterns, industry information reporting the return rates for similar products and contractual agreement terms. We also take into consideration known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product.\n\n## Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues\n\nRoyalty revenue is recognized in the period in which the obligation is satisfied and the corresponding sales by our corporate partners occur. Contract and other revenues are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied.",

These estimates are adjusted to reflect the actual amounts to be collected when those facts and circumstances become known. Significant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of intellectual property. Because of the risk that products in development will not receiv e regulatory approv al, we generally do not recognize any contingent payments that would be due to us upon or after regulatory approv al.\n- For arrangements inv olv ing multiple goods or serv ices (e.g., research and dev elopment, marketing and selling, manufacturing, and distribution), each required good or serv ice is ev aluated to determine whether it is distinct. If a good or serv ice does not qualify as distinct, it is combined with the other non-distinct goods or serv ices within the arrangement and these combined goods or serv ices are treated as a single performance obligation for accounting purposes. The arrangement's transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on the relativ e standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\n\n## Contract Liabilities\n\nOur contract liabilities result from arrangements where we hav e receiv ed payment in adv ance of performance under the contract and do not include sales returns, rebates, and discounts. Changes in contract liabilities are generally due to either receipt of additional adv ance payments or our performance under the contract.\n\nThe following table summarizes contract liability balances at December 31:\n\n",

JNJ does not directly quantify interest rate sensitivity but discloses that the excess of carrying value over fair value of debt was $1.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2023, indicating a smaller relative exposure.

      "question": "How do Amgen, Merck, and Pfizer each characterize their financial relationship with royalty payments, and what does this reveal about their differing strategic dependencies on intellectual property licensing in 2024?",
      "answer": "Amgen reports royalty income as a key component of 'Other revenues,' estimating it based on historical and forecasted sales trends of licensed products, and utilizes the sales- and usage-based royalty exception to recognize revenue as underlying sales occur. Merck, in contrast, discusses royalty payments in the context of contingent consideration liabilities tied to business combinations and licensing agreements, where the fair value of such liabilities is determined using unobservable inputs including projected cash flows, probability of success, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Pfizer highlights the risks associated with royalty payments, particularly in the context of third-party intellectual property claims, noting that infringement findings could result in significant royalty obligations or damages, as seen in disputes involving Abrysvo, Comirnaty, and Paxlovid. Together, these perspectives reveal that Amgen benefits from royalty inflows as part of its revenue model, Merck incorporates royalty obligations into acquisition valuations, and Pfizer faces potential royalty outflows due to IP litigation risks.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues consist primarily of royalty income and corporate partner revenues. Royalties from licensees are based on third-party sales of licensed products and are recorded when the related third-party product sale occurs. Royalty income is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends. Corporate partner revenues are  composed  mainly  of  license  fees  and  milestones  earned  and  our  share  of  commercial  profits  generated  from  collaborations.  See Arrangements  with  multipleperformance obligations, discussed below.\n\n## Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into arrangements for the R&amp;D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and product candidates. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or goods, including intellectual property rights/licenses, R&amp;D services, manufacturing services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to Amgen in the form of nonrefundable, upfront license fees; development and commercial-performance milestone payments; royalty payments; and/or profit sharing.\n\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or by using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\n\nThe  consideration  allocated  to  each  distinct  performance  obligation  is  recognized  as  revenue  when  control  of  the  related  goods  or  services  is  transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will  not  occur.  We  utilize  the  sales-  and  usage-based  royalty  ex ception  in  arrangements  that  resulted  from  the  license  of  intellectual  property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nR&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical  manufacturing  costs;  contract  services  and  other  outside  costs;  information  systems'  costs;  and  amortization  of  acquired  technology  used  in  R&amp;D  with alternative future uses. R&amp;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with third-party R&amp;D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&amp;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSG&amp;A costs are primarily composed of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel;  facilities  and  overhead  costs;  outside  marketing,  advertising  and  legal  ex penses;  the  U.S.  healthcare  reform  federal  ex cise  fee  on  Branded  Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $987 million, $647 million and $841  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  SG &amp;A  ex penses  also  include  costs  and  cost  recoveries  associated  with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG &amp;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract,  we  determine  whether  an  arrangement  is  or  contains  a  lease.  For  all  leases,  we  determine  the  classification  as  either  operating  or financing. Operating leases are included in Other noncurrent assets, Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Lease recognition occurs at the commencement date, and lease liability amounts are based on the present value of lease payments made during the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Because most of our leases do not provide information to determine an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of",

The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows. The Company's estimates of market participant net cash flows consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and  expense  levels;  the  performance  of  competing  products  where  applicable;  relevant  industry  and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain additional marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by the Company's competitors; and the life of each asset's underlying patent and related patent term extension, if any . The net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&amp;D are also determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. The net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. A mounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized  and  accounted  for  as  indefinite-liv ed  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, M erck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain of the Company's business combinations involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the acquisition date.\n\n## Contingent Sales-Based M ilestones\n\nThe terms of certain business development transactions, including collaborative arrangements, licensing agreements and asset acquisitions, require the Company to make payments contingent upon the achievement of sales-based milestones. Sales-based milestones payable by M erck are accrued and capitalized, subject to cumulative amortization catch-up, when determined by the Company to be probable of being achieved based on future sales forecasts. The amortization  catch-up  is  calculated  either  from  the  time  of  the  first  regulatory   approv al  for  products  that  were  unapprov ed  at  the  time  the  transaction  was completed or, for new indications of products that were approved prior to the transaction, from the time the transaction was completed. The related intangible asset that is recognized is amortized over its remaining useful life, subject to impairment testing.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of  substantially  all  performance obligations. M erck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. The majority of the Company's contracts related to the Pharmaceutical and A nimal Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.",

W e rely and expect to continue to rely on a com bination of intellectual property, including patent, tradem ark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and dom ain nam e protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreem ents, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. I f we fail to obtain and m aintain adequate intellectual property protection, we m ay not be able to prevent third parties from  launching generic or biosim ilar versions of our branded products, from  using our proprietary technologies or from  m arketing products that are very sim ilar or identical to ours. O ur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a tim ely basis. Sim ilarly, any term  extensions that we seek m ay not be granted on a tim ely basis, if at all, and any term  adjustm ents related to patent office delays in obtaining a patent m ay be reduced or elim inated entirely due to risks associated with changes in law relating to patent term s. In addition, our issued patents m ay not contain claim s sufficiently broad to protect us against claim s regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term  m ade by parties with sim ilar technologies or products or provide us with any com petitive advantage, including patent-based exclusivity in a particular technology or product area.\n\nFurther, legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governm ents could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from  enforcing intellectual property related to our products. F or exam ple, the W T O 's June 2022 M inisterial D ecision on the Agreem ent on T rade-R elated Aspects of I ntellectual P roperty R ights seeks to m ake it easier for certain W T O  m em bers to issue a com pulsory license on C O VID -19 vaccines.\n\nThe scope of our patent claim s also m ay vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country, its enforcem ent practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country's intellectual property fram ework (e.g., laws or regulations that prom ote or provide broad discretion to issue a com pulsory license). In countries that provide som e form  of regulatory exclusivity, m echanism s exist perm itting som e form  of challenge to our patents by com petitors or generic drug m arketers prior to or im m ediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic com panies are employing aggressive strategies, such as 'at-risk' launches that challenge our patent rights. M ost of the suits involve claim s by generic drug m anufacturers that patents covering our products, uses, processes or dosage form s are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosim ilar drug m anufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attem pts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair com petition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claim s m ay also be brought as counterclaim s to actions we bring to enforce our patents. W e are also party to other patent dam ages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payors, governm ents or other parties are seeking dam ages from  us for alleged delay of generic entry. W e also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-exam ination or opposition proceedings, before the U .S. P atent and T radem ark O ffice, the E uropean P atent O ffice, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents or a com petitors' patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosim ilar products could be introduced into the m arket resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. F or additional inform ation, including inform ation regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16A1 . F urther, if we are unable to m aintain our existing license agreem ents or other agreem ents pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold tradem ark registrations and have tradem ark applications pending in m any jurisdictions, any of which m ay be the subject of a governm ental or third-party objection, which could prevent the m aintenance or issuance of the tradem ark. As our products m ature, our reliance on our tradem arks and trade dress to differentiate us from  our com petitors increases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from  adopting, registering or using tradem arks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. W e seek to protect our proprietary inform ation, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our em ployees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary inform ation and confidentiality agreem ents upon the com m encem ent of their relationship with us. D espite these efforts and precautions, we m ay be unable to prevent a third-party from  copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal rem edies m ay not adequately com pensate us for the dam ages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others m ay independently and lawfully develop substantially sim ilar or identical products that circum vent our intellectual property by m eans of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\n\n## THIRD-PARTY INTE LLE CTU AL PR OPE R TY CLAIMS\n\nA properly functioning intellectual property regim e is essential to our business m odel. W e are com m itted to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other com panies, but the patent granting process is im perfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities m ay require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were im properly granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges m ay not always be successful.\n\nPart of our business depends upon identifying biosim ilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which m ay involve litigation, associated costs and tim e delays, and m ay ultim ately not be successful. T hese opportunities m ay arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In som e circum stances we m ay take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a 'first-to-m arket' or early m arket position for our products.\n\nThird parties m ay claim  that our products infringe one or m ore patents owned or controlled by them . C laim s of intellectual property infringem ent can be costly and tim e-consum ing to resolve, m ay delay or prevent product launches, and m ay result in significant royalty paym ents or dam ages or potential licensing agreem ents. F or exam ple, our R &amp;D  in a therapeutic area m ay not be first and another com pany or entity m ay have obtained relevant patents before us. W e are involved in patent-related disputes with third parties over our attem pts to market pharm aceutical products, including related to Abrysvo, C om irnaty and P axlovid. As we expand our m R N A portfolio, patent-related disputes m ay increase. O nce we have final regulatory approval of the related products, we m ay decide to com m ercially m arket these products even though associated legal proceedings (including any appeals) have not been resolved (i.e., 'at-risk' launch). I f one of our m arketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-prom otion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party m ay be awarded significant dam ages or royalty paym ents, or we m ay be prevented from  further sales of that product. Such dam ages m ay be enhanced as m uch as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n21",

DHR quantifies its allowance for doubtful accounts at $20 million in 2024 and $18 million in 2023, indicating a more formalized and consistently measured credit risk exposure. PFE, while not providing a specific number, highlights that global economic pressures, especially in emerging markets, could materially impact its allowance for doubtful accounts due to government financing constraints, currency fluctuations, and trade restrictions. Together, these disclosures suggest that AMGN relies on a low-risk assumption despite customer concentration, DHR maintains a measured and transparent reserve policy, and PFE anticipates higher uncertainty and potential increases in credit risk due to macroeconomic factors in international markets.",

As a result of these and other factors, our strategy to grow in em erging m arkets m ay not be successful, and any growth rates in these m arkets m ay not be sustainable. Additionally, local econom ic conditions m ay adversely affect the ability of payors, as well as our distributors, custom ers, suppliers and service providers, to pay for our products, or otherwise to buy necessary inventory or raw m aterials, and to perform  their obligations under agreem ents with us.\n\nGovernm ent financing and econom ic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various m arkets where governm ents take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through health technology assessm ents) or other m eans of cost control. For additional inform ation on governm ent pricing pressures, see the Item 1. Business-Government Regulation and Price Constraints section.\n\nWe continue to m onitor the global trade environm ent and potential trade conflicts, sanctions and im pedim ents that could im pact our business. If trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global econom ic activity, potential im pacts could include declining sales; increased costs; volatility in foreign exchange rates; a decline in the value of our financial assets and pension plan investm ents; required increases of our pension funding obligations; increased governm ent cost control efforts; delays or failures in the perform ance of custom ers, suppliers and other third parties on whom  we m ay depend for the perform ance of our business; and the risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts m ay not be adequate. In addition, issued or future executive orders or other new or changes in laws, regulations or policy regarding tariffs, could have a m aterial adverse effect on our business, earnings and financial guidance. The actual im pact of the new tariffs on our business is subject to a num ber of factors including, but not lim ited to, restrictions on trade, the effective date and duration of such tariffs, countries included in the scope of tariffs, changes to am ounts of tariffs, and potential retaliatory tariffs im posed by other countries.\n\nWe operate in m any countries and transact in m any different currencies. C hanges in the value of those currencies relative to the U .S. dollar, or high inflation or deflation in those countries, can im pact our revenues, costs and expenses and our financial guidance. Significant portions of our revenues, costs and expenses, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to exchange rate changes. In 2024, 39% of our total revenues were derived from  international operations, including 19% from  E urope and 13% from  C hina, Japan and the rest of the Asia P acific region. F uture changes in exchange rates or econom ic conditions and the im pact they m ay have on our results of operations, financial condition or business are difficult to predict. F or additional inform ation about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within M D &amp;A.\n\nI n addition, our borrowing, pension benefit and postretirem ent benefit obligations and interest-bearing investm ents are subject to risk from  changes in interest and exchange rates. T he risks related to interest-bearing investm ents and borrowings and the m easures we have taken to help contain them  are discussed in the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within M D &amp;A and Note 7E . F or additional details on critical accounting estim ates and assum ptions for our benefit plans, see the Significant Accounting Policies and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions-Benefit Plans section within M D &amp;A and Note 11 .\n\n## PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, SALE S AND MARKE TING RISKS\n\nWe could encounter difficulties, delays or inefficiencies in our supply chain, product m anufacturing and distribution networks, as well as sales or m arketing, due to regulatory actions, shut-downs, work stoppages or strikes, approval delays, withdrawals, recalls, penalties, supply disruptions, shortages or stock-outs at our facilities or third-party facilities that we rely on, reputational harm , the im pact to our facilities due to health pandem ics or natural or m an-m ade disasters, including as a result of clim ate change, product liability or unanticipated costs. E xam ples of such difficulties or delays include the inability to increase or m aintain production capacity com m ensurate with dem and; challenges related to com ponent m aterials to m aintain supply and/or appropriate quality standards throughout our supply network and/or com ply with applicable regulations; inability to supply certain products due to voluntary product recalls or withdrawals, including, for exam ple, our voluntary withdrawal of all lots of O xbryta in all m arkets where it is approved; and supply chain disruptions at our facilities or at a supplier or vendor. In addition, we engage contract m anufacturers, and, from  tim e to tim e, our contract m anufacturers m ay face difficulties or are unable to m anufacture our products at the necessary quantity or quality levels.\n\nRegulatory agencies periodically inspect our m anufacturing facilities, as well as third-party facilities that we rely on, to evaluate com pliance with cG M P  or other applicable requirem ents. F ailure to com ply with these requirem ents m ay subject us to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of m anufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions, debarm ent, product recalls, delays or denials of product approvals, im port bans or denials of im port certifications. In response to requests from  various regulatory authorities, m anufacturers across the pharm aceutical industry, including P fizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or form ation of nitrosam ines and we are actively engaging with regulatory authorities on this topic. If nitrosam ines are detected above certain levels in our products, this m ay lead to m arket action for such products. F or exam ple, in 2021, P fizer recalled all lots of C hantix due to the presence of a nitrosam ine, N -nitroso-varenicline, at or above the acceptable intake lim its com m unicated by various regulatory authorities. R egulatory authorities have since issued updated guidance on nitrosam ine acceptable intake levels. W ith this guidance, which included an updated intake level for N -nitroso-varenicline, we have started m aking regulatory subm issions to potentially enable C hantix to return to m arket in the U .S. and in certain international m arkets.\n\nSee the Overview  of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook -Our Operating Environment section within M D &amp;A.\n\n## COLLABORATIONS AND OTHE R RE LATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIE S\n\nWe depend on third-party collaborators, service providers, and others in the research, developm ent, m anufacturing and com m ercialization of our products and product candidates and also enter into JVs and other business developm ent transactions. To achieve expected longer-term  benefits, we m ay m ake substantial upfront paym ents as part of these transactions, which m ay negatively im pact our earnings or cash flows. W e rely heavily on these parties for m ultiple aspects of our drug developm ent, m anufacturing and commercialization activities, but we do not control m any aspects of those activities. W e also outsource certain services, including activities related to transaction processing, accounting, IT, m anufacturing, clinical trial recruitm ent and execution, clinical lab services, non-clinical research, safety services, integrated facilities\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n17",

      "question": "How do ABBV, ABT, and DHR each compare their 2021 earnings before income taxes, and what does this reveal about their relative profitability and operating performance in that year?",
      "answer": "In 2021, ABBV reported pre-tax earnings of $12.989 billion, ABT reported $8.211 billion, and DHR reported $7.598 billion. This indicates that ABBV had the highest pre-tax earnings among the three, followed by ABT and then DHR. The differences in magnitude reflect variations in their operating performance, with ABBV benefiting from strong foreign earnings, ABT managing a larger base of segment earnings offset by corporate costs, and DHR showing solid but comparatively lower profitability driven by operating profit and nonoperating income.",

        "Hop 1: ABBV \u2192 Pre-Tax Earnings: ABBV reports total earnings before income tax expense of $12,989 million for 2021, showing strong profitability driven by foreign earnings.",
        "Hop 2: ABT \u2192 Pre-Tax Earnings: ABT reports earnings from continuing operations before taxes of $8,211 million for 2021, reflecting solid performance despite deductions such as interest and amortization.",

Pfizer, in contrast, assesses revenue growth rates as part of its valuation of acquired intangible assets\u2014specifically through the lens of in-process R&D and developed technology rights from its acquisition of Seagen, where forecasted revenue growth rates are compared against historical performance, peer benchmarks, and analyst expectations.",

IPR&amp;D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.\n\nAbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an i mpairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nAnnually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the i ndustry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is l es s  than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed.\n\nFor its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of the related intangible assets. Future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.\n\n## Contingent Consideration\n\nThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, i ncluding the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material i mpact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.",

Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in ev aluating our company. It is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations, reputation, and prospects could be materially adv ersely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believ e to be immaterial could also adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations, reputation, and prospects.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\n- Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies.\n\nThere are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and dev elopment, the introduction of new products and indications, business development activ ities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, and commercialization of our products.\n\nThere is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discov ery and dev elopment. To bring a product from the discov ery phase to market takes considerable time and entails significant cost. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial inv estment and following meaningful cost for manufacturing capabilities and inv entory to prepare for launch. As a result, a significant portion of funds inv ested in research and development programs will not generate direct financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in dev elopment or prior to being acquired may fail to reach the market or may hav e only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approv als or payer reimbursement or cov erage, failure to obtain placement on guidelines or recommendations published by third-party organizations that are commensurate with clinical data, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approv ed uses, label changes, changes in the relev ant treatment standards or the av ailability of newer, better, or more cost-effectiv e competitiv e products, difficulty or excessiv e costs to manufacture, insufficient infrastructure to support detection, diagnostic or other requisites for treatment, ineffectiv eness in connecting with healthcare professionals, including digitally through v irtual engagements, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. We may also fail to allocate research and dev elopment resources efficiently, fail to pursue or inv est sufficiently in product candidates or indications that may hav e been successful, or fail to optimally balance trial design, conduct, and speed to accomplish desired outcomes.\n\nRegulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delay, uncertainty, unpredictability, and inconsistency in drug approv al processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches, lost market opportunities, impairment of inv entories, and other negativ e impacts. In addition, it can be v ery difficult to predict rev enue growth rates of, or v ariability in demand for, new or future products and indications, which in some cases leads to difficulty meeting product demand or, on the other hand, lower v olume growth, excess inv entory and related financial charges.\n\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our products and indications now under dev elopment will be approv ed or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approv al will be maintained; whether we will be able to dev elop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates, indications, or products; or whether our products and indications, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nThrough internal innov ation and business dev elopment we must maintain a flow of successful products and indications or line extensions sufficient both to cov er our substantial research and dev elopment costs and inv estments and to replace rev enues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls, lose intellectual property exclusiv ity, or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to timely replenish our product portfolio and pipeline would hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Our dependence on, or focus in, one or more key products or product classes exacerbates this risk. In addition, the growth of our business and rev enue base increases the risk that products dev eloped or acquired by us may not prov ide adequate v alue to sustain further long-term growth.\n\nWe engage in various forms of business dev elopment activ ities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, codevelopment agreements, co-promotion arrangements, distribution",

W e involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the C om pany's interpretation of tax laws, including the assessm ent of transfer pricing practices in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations. W e inspected settlem ents with applicable taxing authorities, including assessing the expiration of statutes of lim itations. W e tested the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the C om pany's assessm ent of the technical m erits of tax positions and estim ates of the am ount of tax benefits expected to be sustained.\n\nEvaluation of product liability and other product-related litigation\n\nAs discussed in N otes 1S and 16 to the consolidated financial statem ents, the C om pany is involved in product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal injury, consum er fraud, off-label prom otion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claim s, am ong others. C ertain of these pending product and other product-related legal proceedings could result in losses that could be substantial. T he accrued liability and/or disclosure for the pending product liability and other product-related legal proceedings requires a com plex series of judgm ents by the C om pany about future events, which involves a num ber of uncertainties.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of product liability and other product-related litigation as a critical audit m atter. C hallenging auditor judgm ent was required to evaluate the C om pany's judgm ents about future events and uncertainties.\n\nThe following are the prim ary procedures we perform ed to address this critical audit m atter. W e evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the C om pany's product liability and other product-related litigation processes, including controls related to (1) the evaluation of inform ation from  external and internal legal counsel, (2) forward-looking expectations, and (3) new legal proceedings, or other legal proceedings not currently reserved or disclosed. W e read letters received directly from  the Company's external and internal legal counsel that described the C om pany's probable or reasonably possible legal contingency to pending product liability and other product-related legal proceedings. W e inspected the C om pany's m inutes from  m eetings of the Audit C om m ittee, which included the status of key litigation m atters. W e evaluated the C om pany's ability to estim ate its m onetary exposure to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings by com paring historically recorded liabilities to actual m onetary am ounts incurred upon resolution of prior legal m atters. W e analyzed relevant publicly available inform ation about the C om pany, its com petitors, and the industry.\n\nEvaluation of the fair value measurement of the developed technology rights and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired in the Seagen business combination\n\nAs discussed in N ote 2A to the consolidated financial statem ents, on D ecem ber 14, 2023, the C om pany acquired Seagen Inc. and its subsidiaries (Seagen). T he total fair value of consideration transferred was $44.2 billion. O f that, the C om pany recorded $7.5 billion of developed technology rights with an estim ated weighted-average life of approxim ately 18 years and $19.9 billion of in-process research and developm ent (IP R &amp;D ). T he prelim inary estim ates of the fair value of intangible assets were finalized during the m easurem ent period in 2024. As discussed in N ote 1M , the C om pany perform s im pairm ent testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever im pairm ent indicators are present. W hen necessary, the C om pany records im pairm ents of long-lived assets for the am ount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value m easurem ent of Seagen acquired developed technology rights and IP R &amp;D  as a critical audit m atter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgm ent was required to evaluate certain key assum ptions used to estim ate the acquisition-date fair value of the acquired developed technology rights and IP R &amp;D , as well as the fair value for im pairm ent testing purposes. Specifically, the key assum ptions for certain IP R &amp;D  assets, including revenue growth rates, probability of technical and regulatory success (P T R S) rates, and the discount rate, and the key assum ptions for certain developed technology rights, including revenue growth rates and the discount rate, represented subjective determ inations of future m arket and econom ic conditions. C hanges to those assum ptions could have had a significant effect on the determ ination of the fair value m easurem ents.\n\nThe following are the prim ary procedures we perform ed to address this critical audit m atter. W e evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the C om pany's valuation process, including controls related to the developm ent of the key assum ptions for certain IP R &amp;D  assets and developed technology rights. We perform ed sensitivity analyses over the key assum ptions for certain IP R &amp;D  assets and developed technology rights to assess the im pact of changes in those key assum ptions on the C om pany's determ ination of the fair value of the IP R &amp;D  and developed technology rights, respectively. W e evaluated the reasonableness of the C om pany's forecasted revenue growth rates by com paring them  to historical results, com parable products and peer com panies, analyst expectations, industry related third-party data, and the assum ptions used in prior periods. F urther, we evaluated the P T R S rates for certain IP R &amp;D  assets by considering the phase of developm ent of the clinical projects and the C om pany's history of obtaining regulatory approval and com paring them  to P T R S rates derived from  analyst reports and other industry related third-party data and the assum ptions used in prior periods. W e evaluated the data sources used by m anagem ent in determ ining the key assum ptions for certain IP R &amp;D  assets and developed technology rights by com paring to industry standards and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\n- (1) evaluating the discount rates used by the C om pany for certain IP R &amp;D  and developed technology rights by com paring them  against discount rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available m arket data for com parable entities\n- (2) testing the source inform ation underlying the determ ination of the discount rates.\n\nWe have not been able to determ ine the specific year that we or our predecessor firm s began serving as the C om pany's auditor, however, we are aware that we or our predecessor firm s have served as the C om pany's auditor since at least 1942.\n\nNew York, N ew York\n\nFebruary 27, 2025\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n50",

Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nCertain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions, by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of-abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). The global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. Please see 'Item 1. Business-Regulatory Matters' for more information. Failure to meet these requirements can adversely impact our business and financial statements in the applicable geographies.\n\nTo varying degrees, these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities, and if safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as providing additional warnings on the product's label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product's market acceptance. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards, including the federal regulations described in 'Item 1. Business-Regulatory Matters.'\n\nGovernment authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of laws or regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, fines, expenses, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal penalties, consent decrees, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, pre-market notification rescissions and other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled 'Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.' Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us, our business may be impaired. Ensuring that our operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs.\n\n## Our products can be subject to human clinical trials, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nAs a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator's or the market's perception of these clinical data, can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements.",

Management and representatives of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management's assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as 'plans,' 'expects,' 'will,' 'anticipates,' 'estimates' and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated cost savings and other benefits; the planned separation of the Company's Consumer Health business; the Company's strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.\n\nBecause forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company's actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\n## Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition\n\n- Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company's continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;\n- Challenges to the Company's ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;\n- The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue and market share losses;\n- Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company's patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;\n- Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence;\n- Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;\n- Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and\n- Allegations that the Company's products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company's ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.\n\n## Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity\n\n- Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact;\n- The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;",

Additionally,  the  Company  has  entered  and  will  enter  into  business  development  transactions,  borrowings  or  other financial transactions that may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure.\n\nSince  the  Company  cannot,  with  certainty,  foresee  and  mitigate  against  such  adverse  fluctuations,  fluctuations  in currency  exchange  rates,  interest  rates  and  inflation  could  negatively  affect  the  Company's  business,  cash  flow,  results  of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nIn order to mitigate against the adverse impact of these market fluctuations, the Company will from time to time enter into  hedging  agreements. While hedging agreements, such as currency options and forwards and interest rate swaps, may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not always successful.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  interest  rate  derivatives  and  investments  are  based  on  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate (LIBOR), and a portion of Merck's indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which will cause LIBOR to cease to exist entirely in the future. While the Company has begun to implement alternative reference rates as alternatives to LIBOR, the Company cannot  predict  the  consequences  and  timing  of  any  additional  or  unexpected  developments,  which  could  include  an increase in interest expense and will also require the amendment of contracts that reference LIBOR.\n\n## Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns.\n\nUnexpected  safety  or  efficacy  concerns  can  arise  with  respect  to  marketed  products,  whether  or  not  scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as product liability, consumer fraud and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions.\n\n## Reliance  on  third-party  relationships  and  outsourcing  arrangements  could  materially  adversely  affect  the Company's business.\n\nThe  Company  depends  on  third  parties,  including  suppliers,  alliances  with  other  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology companies,  and  third-party service providers, for key  aspects of its  business  including  development,  manufacture  and commercialization of its products and support for its information technology (IT) systems. Failure of these third parties to meet their  contractual,  regulatory  and  other  obligations  to  the  Company  or  the  development  of  factors  that  materially  disrupt  the relationships between the Company and these third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\n\n## Negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFuture sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as African Swine Fever,  could  lead  to  their  widespread  death  and  precautionary  destruction  as  well  as  the  reduced  consumption  and  demand  for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks  specific  to  animal  health  include  epidemics  and  pandemics,  government  procurement  and  pricing  practices,  weather  and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, sales of Bravecto represent a significant portion of the Company's Animal Health segment sales. Any negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's Animal Health sales. As the Animal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations would also become more significant.",

      "question": "How do AbbVie, Gilead, and UnitedHealth each demonstrate or constrain their financial flexibility through debt management, liquidity strategies, and strategic transaction impacts, and what does this reveal about their respective risk profiles?",
      "answer": "AbbVie maintains strong financial flexibility through a $4.0 billion credit facility with no outstanding borrowings as of 2021, and it emphasizes its ability to issue debt or attract long-term capital to support growth. Gilead, in contrast, faces constraints on financial flexibility due to its acquisition-driven strategy, including a credit rating downgrade following the Immunomedics acquisition, which increased debt and limited its ability to fund future initiatives. UnitedHealth leverages a diversified liquidity model, drawing from regulated subsidiary dividends of $8.0 billion in 2021 and utilizing commercial paper and credit facilities to maintain flexibility for acquisitions, dividends, and stock buybacks. The synthesis reveals that AbbVie and UnitedHealth manage flexibility through conservative debt and strong liquidity planning, while Gilead\u2019s strategic investments have introduced financial risk that limits its flexibility.",

          "chunk_text": "No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2021. In 2020, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.\n\n## Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings\n\n## Credit Facility\n\nAbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2021, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Access to Capital\n\nThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nThere were no changes to the company's credit ratings during 2021. Following the acquisition of Allergan in 2020, S&amp;P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook.\n\nUnfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt.\n\n## Future Cash Requirements\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Strategic and Financial Risks\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with engaging in business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, collaborations, options, equity investments, asset divestitures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, such transactions as part of our business strategy. We may not identify suitable transactions in the future and, if we do, we may not complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis,  or  at  all,  and  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits.  If  we  are  successful  in  making  an  acquisition  or  closing  a  licensing arrangement  or  collaboration,  the  products,  intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  may  not  be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than anticipated. As part of our annual impairment testing of  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter,  and  earlier  if  impairment  indicators  exist,  as required  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  we  may  need  to  recognize  impairment  charges  if  the  products, intellectual  property  and  technologies  that  are  acquired  or  licensed  are  not  successful.  For  option  structured  deals,  there  is  no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic transactions, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV, the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.\n\nWe  have  paid  substantial  amounts  of  cash  and  incurred  additional  debt  to  finance  our  strategic  transactions.  Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. For example, as a result of the  cash  used  and  the  debt  issued  in  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  Inc.  in  2020,  S&amp;P  Global  Ratings downgraded our credit rating. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.\n\n## Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  various  foreign  jurisdictions.  Due  to  economic  and  political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws, and we cannot predict the form or  timing  of  such  changes.  Our  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations, including in the United States, Germany and Ireland.\n\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.\n\n## ITEM  1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM  2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur  corporate  headquarters  are  located  in  Foster  City,  California,  where  we  house  our  administrative,  manufacturing  and R&amp;D activities. We also have R&amp;D facilities in Emeryville, Oceanside and Santa Monica, California; Seattle, Washington; Morris Plains, New Jersey; Frederick, Maryland; Edmonton, Canada; and Dublin, Ireland. Our principal manufacturing facilities are in El Segundo, La Verne, Oceanside and San Dimas, California; Edmonton, Canada; Cork, Ireland and Hoofddorp, Netherlands. For more information about our manufacturing facilities, see Item 1. Business ' Our Manufacturing Facilities. ' Our global operations include offices in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and the Middle East.\n\nWe believe that our existing properties, including both owned and leased sites, are adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to purchase, lease or construct any additional facilities required to meet our expected long-term growth needs.",

We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses.\n\nOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.\n\nOur U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.0 billion and $8.3 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.\n\nOur nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.\n\n## Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n",

BUSINESS.\n\n## General\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (\"we\", the \"Company\", or \"BMS\") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1933 under the name BristolMyers Company, as successor to a New Y ork business started in 1887. In 1989, Bristol-Myers Company changed its name to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company as a result of a merger.\n\nWe operate in one segment engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of biopharmaceutical products on a global basis. Our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. Our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular, neuroscience and other areas where we can also deliver attractive returns for shareholders. Our priorities are to focus on transformational medicines where we have a competitive advantage, drive operational excellence and strategically allocate capital for long-term growth and shareholder returns.  For a further discussion of our strategy initiatives, refer to 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Strategy.' In addition, we expect that our acquisitions  of  Karuna,  RayzeBio  and  Mirati  in  2024  will  allow  us  to  ex pand  in  neuroscience  and  oncology,  and  continue  to  position  us  as  a  leading biopharmaceutical company across our core therapeutic areas.\n\nWe compete with other global research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies and generic drug manufacturers. Our products are sold worldwide, primarily to wholesalers, distributors, specialty pharmacies, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. We have significant manufacturing operations in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe percentage of revenues by significant region/country were as follows:\n\n",

In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R &amp;D  efforts seek to add value to our existing products by im proving their safety, efficacy and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications.\n\nOur R&amp;D Priorities and Strategy. Our R&amp;D priorities include:\n\n- delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated m edicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the m ost im portant new therapies to patients in need;\n- advancing our capabilities that can position us for long-term  R &amp;D  leadership; and\n- advancing new m odels for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.\n\nTo that end, our R &amp;D  prim arily focuses on our m ain therapeutic areas, which are oncology, internal m edicine (including cardiovascular and m igraine), vaccines and inflam m ation and im m unology.\n\nWhile a significant portion of our R &amp;D  is internal, we also seek prom ising chem ical and biological lead m olecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into our discovery and developm ent processes or projects, as well as our portfolio. W e do so by entering into collaboration, alliance and license agreem ents with universities, biotechnology com panies and other firm s as well as through acquisitions and investm ents. T hese arrangem ents allow us to share knowledge, risk and cost. T hey also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise, as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and in-licensed or acquired products. For inform ation on certain of these collaborations, alliances and license arrangem ents and investm ents, see Note 2 .\n\nOur R&amp;D Operations. I n 2024, we continued to enhance our global R &amp;D  operations and pursued strategies to im prove R &amp;D  productivity and advance a sustainable and value-creating pipeline. O ncology was organized in an end-to-end O ncology R &amp;D  (O R D ) organization, spanning discovery to late-phase clinical developm ent. P fizer R esearch and D evelopm ent (P R D ) m anaged the sam e for our rem aining therapeutic areas in addition to certain platform  organizations. E ffective January 1, 2025, O R D  and P R D  were consolidated into a single R&amp;D organization to further strengthen P fizer's capabilities and leadership in discovering and developing breakthrough m edicines and vaccines. As part of these changes, we are now evaluating how our sim plified structure and sharpened focus m ight lead to im provem ents in productivity and potential efficiencies. W e expect any potential savings identified through these efforts to be reinvested in our R &amp;D  portfolio.\n\nWe manage R&amp;D operations on a total-com pany basis through the organizations described above. The P ortfolio M anagem ent Team  (P M T), currently chaired by our C hief Strategy and I nnovation O fficer, E xecutive Vice P resident, is accountable for aligning resources across R &amp;D , and for helping to ensure optim al capital allocation across the R &amp;D  portfolio. W e believe that this approach also serves to m axim ize accountability and flexibility.\n\nWe do not disaggregate total R &amp;D  expense by developm ent phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we m anage our R &amp;D  strategy and operations collectively under the governance of the P M T and do not m anage our R &amp;D  operational spend independently by developm ent phase or by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, we believe that any prior-period inform ation about R &amp;D  expense by developm ent phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.\n\nFor additional inform ation on our R &amp;D  operations, including R &amp;D  related costs and expenses, see the Costs and Expenses -Research and Development Expenses section within MD&amp;A and Note 17 .\n\nOur R&amp;D Pipeline. The process of drug, vaccine and biological product discovery from  initiation through developm ent and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take m ore than ten years. As of February 4, 2025, we had the following num ber of projects in various stages of R &amp;D :\n\nDevelopm ent of a single com pound is often pursued as part of m ultiple program s. W hile our product candidates m ay or m ay not receive regulatory approval, new candidates entering clinical developm ent phases are the foundation for future products. Inform ation concerning several of our drug, vaccine and biological candidates in developm ent, as well as supplem ental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Product Developments section within M D &amp;A. T he discovery and developm ent of drugs, vaccines and biological products are tim e consum ing, costly and unpredictable.\n\nFor inform ation on the risks associated with R &amp;D , see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Research and Development section.\n\n## COLLABORATION AND CO-PROMOTION AGREEMENTS\n\nWe use collaboration and/or co-prom otion arrangem ents to enhance our developm ent, R &amp;D , sales and distribution of certain biopharm aceutical products, which include, am ong others, the following:\n\n- Comirnaty is an m R N A-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent C O VID -19, which is being jointly developed and com m ercialized with BioN T ech. P fizer and BioN T ech equally share the costs of developm ent for the C om irnaty program . C om irnaty has been granted an approval or an authorization in m any countries around the world in populations varying by country. We also share gross profits equally from  com m ercialization of C om irnaty (excluding C hina, H ong Kong, M acau and T aiwan, where we do not have rights), subject to regulatory authorizations or approvals m arket by m arket.

      "question": "How do AbbVie, Eli Lilly, and Thermo Fisher each account for excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation in their 2023 financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about the relative scale and treatment of these benefits across the three companies?",
      "answer": "AbbVie reported realized excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $90 million in 2023, reflecting a decline from $116 million in 2022 and $50 million in 2021. Eli Lilly referenced excess tax benefits in the context of stock-based compensation but did not provide specific dollar amounts, instead grouping them with other tax impacts such as non-deductible stock-based compensation and global tax provisions. Thermo Fisher disclosed an excess tax benefit from stock options and restricted stock units of $69 million in 2023, down from $80 million in 2022 and $124 million in 2021. This comparative view shows that all three firms recognize such benefits as a meaningful component of their tax provisions, though the magnitude and trend vary, with AbbVie showing a rebound from 2021 to 2023 and Thermo Fisher showing a consistent decline over the same period.",

      "answer": "In 2021, ABBV reported Dividends Payable of $2,543 million, AMGN reported $1,083 million, and PFE reported $2,249 million. ABBV's higher Dividends Payable suggests a more aggressive dividend policy compared to AMGN, which had the lowest among the three, potentially prioritizing reinvestment or other capital uses. PFE's Dividends Payable was close to ABBV\u2019s, indicating a significant commitment to returning value to shareholders, though slightly less than ABBV. These differences may reflect varying capital allocation strategies within the healthcare sector, with ABBV and PFE emphasizing shareholder returns more prominently than AMGN.",

      "answer": "Amgen reported a cash outflow of $2,529 million for acquisitions in 2022, indicating a significant investment in M&A activity. Johnson & Johnson paid $60 million in net cash for acquisitions, reflecting a much smaller M&A footprint during the year. In contrast, Medtronic experienced a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions by $903 million compared to the prior year, suggesting a reduction in acquisition activity. These differences highlight varying strategic approaches: Amgen pursued larger deals, JNJ took a more conservative stance, and Medtronic scaled back from previous acquisition levels.",

          "chunk_text": "\nOperating Activities The $1.1 billion increase in net cash provided was primarily driven by an increase in cash collected from customers along with a decrease in cash paid for income taxes. The increase in net cash provided was partially offset by an increase in cash paid to employees. The increase in cash collected from customers was primarily related to COVID-19 driving decreased sales in the fourth quarter of  fiscal  year  2020  and  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2021.  The  decrease  in  cash  paid  for  income  taxes  was  primarily  due  to  increased estimated  federal  tax  payments  and  tax  payments  associated  with  IRS  audit  settlements  in  fiscal  year  2021.  Cash  paid  to  employees increased due to higher annual incentive plan payouts compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\nInvesting Activities The $1.2 billion decrease in net cash used was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $903 million, as well as a decrease of net purchases of investments of $273 million as compared to fiscal year 2021.\n\nFinancing Activities The $1.2 billion increase in net cash used was largely the result of the increase of share repurchases of $1.9 billion. The increase in net cash used was offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings of $311 million. For fiscal year 2021, financing cash flows were impacted by the Mizuho Bank term loan under which we borrowed \u00a5300 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, which was subsequently repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Fiscal year 2021 financing cash flows were also impacted by the issuance of $7.2  billion  of  Euro-denominated  senior  notes  offset  by  the  early  redemption  of  $6.0  billion  of  senior  notes  for  $6.3  billion  of  total consideration, and repayment of an additional $911 million of Euro-denominated senior notes. For more information on the Mizuho Bank term loan, and issuances and redemptions of senior notes, refer to Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Debt and Capital\n\nOur  capital  structure  consists  of  equity  and  interest-bearing  debt.  We  primarily  utilize  unsecured  senior  debt  obligations  to  meet  our financing needs and, to a lesser extent, bank borrowings. From time to time, we may repurchase our outstanding debt obligations in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.\n\nTotal debt at April 29, 2022 was $24.1 billion, as compared to $26.4 billion at April 30, 2021. The decrease in total debt was driven by fluctuations in exchange rates as it pertains to our Euro-denominated senior notes.\n\nSubsequent to fiscal year 2022, on May 2, 2022, we entered into a term loan agreement (Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement) with Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for an aggregate principal amount of up to \u00a5300 billion with a term of 364 days. In May and June 2022, Medtronic Luxco borrowed an aggregate of \u00a5297 billion, or approximately $2.3 billion, of the term loan, under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement. The Company used the net  proceeds  of  the  borrowings  to  fund  the  early  redemption  of  $1.9  billion  of  Medtronic  Inc.  Senior  Notes  for  $1.9  billion  of  total consideration, and $368 million of Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes for $376 million of total consideration. The Company will recognize a total  loss  on  debt  extinguishment  of  $53  million  in  the  quarter  ended  July  29,  2022,  which  primarily  includes  cash  premiums  and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss will be recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.",

      "answer": "Amgen allocates consideration across multiple performance obligations in collaborative arrangements, using relative standalone selling prices and recognizing revenue as control transfers or milestones are achieved. Bristol-Myers Squibb received $884 million in non-refundable up-front and milestone payments from Pfizer but did not allocate consideration to individual rights, instead treating the global alliance as a single unit of accounting with amortization over the co-promotion period. Thermo Fisher discloses contingent consideration in the context of acquisitions and financing activities, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related payments as part of its non-GAAP exclusions. Together, these approaches show differing strategies in structuring and accounting for collaborative arrangements \u2014 Amgen with detailed performance obligation allocation, BMS with bundled alliance accounting, and Thermo Fisher with acquisition-focused contingent consideration reporting.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues consist primarily of royalty income and corporate partner revenues. Royalties from licensees are based on thirdparty sales of licensed products and are recorded when the related third-party product sale occurs. Royalty income is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends. Corporate partner revenues are composed mainly of license fees and milestones earned and our share of commercial profits generated from collaborations. See Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations, discussed below.\n\n## Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  enter  into  arrangements  for  the  R&amp;D,  manufacture  and/or  commercialization  of  products  and  product candidates.  Such  arrangements  may  require  us  to  deliver  various  rights,  services  and/or  goods,  including  intellectual  property rights/licenses, R&amp;D services, manufacturing services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally  provide  for  consideration  to  Amgen  in  the  form  of  nonrefundable,  upfront  license  fees;  development  and  commercialperformance milestone payments; royalty payments; and/or profit sharing.\n\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what  the  selling  price  would  be  if  the  deliverable  was  regularly  sold  by  us  on  a  stand-alone  basis  or  by  using  an  adjusted  market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\n\nThe consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We utilize the sales- and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nR&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems' costs; and amortization of acquired technology used in R&amp;D with alternative future uses. R&amp;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated  with  third-party  R&amp;D  arrangements,  including  upfront  fees  and  milestones  paid  to  third  parties  in  connection  with technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&amp;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 8, Collaborations.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSG&amp;A  costs  are  primarily  composed  of  salaries,  benefits  and  other  staff-related  costs  associated  with  sales  and  marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee on Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $843 million, $962 million and $789 million during the years ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  SG&amp;A  expenses  also  include  costs  and  cost  recoveries  associated  with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&amp;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 8, Collaborations.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt  inception  of  a  contract,  we  determine  whether  an  arrangement  is  or  contains  a  lease.  For  all  leases,  we  determine  the classification as either operating or financing. Operating leases are included in Other noncurrent assets, Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

LLY, while not explicitly stating its 2024 income tax payments, highlighted that such payments are a key component of its cash requirements, alongside capital expenditures and business development, with operating cash flow rising to $8.82 billion.

          "chunk_text": "## Operating Activities\n\nCash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in  our  results  of  operations. As  a  result,  changes  in  cash  from  operating  activities  reflect  the  timing  of  cash  collections  from  customers  and  alliance  partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe $1.3 billion increase in cash flow provided by operating activities compared to 2023, was primarily due to higher customer collections, net of rebates, discounts, and alliance payments ($3.4 billion) and lower income tax payments ($450 million), partially offset by higher acquisition-related payments, including cash settlement of unvested stock awards ($1.0 billion), and higher interest ex pense payments on debt ($600 million), as well as timing of payments in the ordinary course of business.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase, proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties), the sale and maturity of marketable securities, sale of equity investments, as well as upfront and contingent milestones payments from licensing arrangements.\n\nThe $19.1 billion increase in cash flow used in investing activities compared to 2023 was due to payments for the Mirati, RayzeBio and Karuna acquisitions and SystImmune collaboration of $20.7 billion, partially offset by changes in the amount of marketable debt securities held of $1.4 billion.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.\n\nThe $14.5 billion change in cash provided by financing activities compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher net borrowings of $9.6 billion used primarily to fund our acquisitions and share repurchases of $5.2 billion in 2023.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nFor  recently  issued  accounting  standards,  refer  to  'Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data-Note  1. Accounting  Policies  and  Recently  Issued Accounting Standards.'\n\n## SEC Consent Order\n\nAs previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004.\n\nUnder the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of  inventory  on  hand,  without  making  a  timely  public  disclosure  of  any  change  in  practice.  We  also  agreed  in  the  Consent  to  certain  measures  that  we  have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.\n\nWe have established a company-wide policy concerning our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns.

As of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and serv ices to produce our products and conduct our operations, income tax payments, capital expenditures, div idends, milestone and royalty payments, business development activ ities, share repurchases and repayment of outstanding borrowings (see Notes 14, 4, 3, 13, and 11 to the consolidated financial statements).

The executed agreements could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $14 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or serv ices primarily related to our incretin medicines, including medicines in dev elopment, ov er the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.27 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared with $2.82 billion at December 31, 2023.

      "question": "How did the cost of goods sold (COGS) trends in 2021 impact gross profit margins for Abbott (ABT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Merck (MRK), and what does this reveal about their respective cost management and pricing power in the healthcare sector?",
      "answer": "In 2021, Abbott reported gross profit margins of 52.2%, which were impacted by higher manufacturing costs and restructuring charges, particularly a $499 million charge in the Diagnostic Products segment due to inventory write-downs and fixed asset impairments. Johnson & Johnson had a COGS of $29,855 million in 2021, resulting in a gross profit of $63,920 million, indicating a strong gross margin despite rising costs. Merck, with a much smaller COGS of $167 million in 2021, primarily related to alliance revenue products like Lynparza, demonstrated a very high gross margin, suggesting strong pricing power and efficient cost control in its partnered drug portfolio. The differences highlight Abbott\u2019s exposure to volatile diagnostic demand and restructuring, JNJ\u2019s scale and diversified cost structure, and Merck\u2019s strategic alliance-driven cost efficiency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABT \u2192 COGS: Abbott's gross margin was 52.2% in 2021, impacted by a $499 million restructuring charge in the Diagnostic Products segment, including $248 million in inventory write-downs and $80 million in fixed asset impairments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating Earnings\n\nGross profit margins were 52.2 percent of net sales in 2021, 50.5 percent in 2020 and 52.5 percent in 2019. In 2021,  the  increase  primarily  reflects  the  effects  of  higher  sales  volume,  higher  manufacturing  utilization,  and  the nonrecurrence of the 2020 impairment of intangible assets, partially offset by increases in various manufacturing costs and the impact of higher restructuring charges. In 2020, the decrease primarily reflects the mix of sales across Abbott's various businesses and operational inefficiencies due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as the increase in intangible asset amortization, the impairment of intangible assets and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on gross margin.\n\nResearch and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $2.7 billion in 2021, and $2.4 billion in both 2020 and 2019. The increase in 2021 R&amp;D spending was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development. R&amp;D spending in 2020 was relatively flat compared to 2019 as the impact of the immediate expensing in 2019 of an R&amp;D asset valued at $102 million that was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. was partially offset by the $55 million impairment of an in-process R&amp;D intangible asset in 2020. R&amp;D expense in 2020 also reflects lower integration and restructuring costs in 2020 related to R&amp;D, partially offset by higher spending on various projects.\n\nSelling,  general  and  administrative  (SG&amp;A)  expenses  increased  16.8  percent  in  2021  due  primarily  to  higher selling  and  marketing  spending  to  drive  growth  across  various  businesses  and  the  nonrecurrence  of  $100  million  of income in 2020 from a litigation settlement. The increase in 2021 also includes charges related to certain litigation. SG&amp;A expenses  were  basically  flat  in  2020  compared  to  2019.  In  2020,  the  favorable  effect  of  foreign  exchange, income of approximately $100 million from a litigation settlement in 2020, lower spending due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, and the impact of various cost saving initiatives were offset by higher spending to drive growth in various businesses.\n\n## Restructurings\n\nOn May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter in projected testing demand  driven  by  several  factors,  including  significant  reductions  in  cases  in  the  U.S.  and  other  major  developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority's updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset write-downs of $80 million,  inventory-related  charges  of  $248  million,  and  other  exit  costs,  which  included  contract  cancellations  and employee-related costs of $171 million.\n\nIn  the  second  half  of  2021,  as  the  Delta  and  Omicron  variants  of  COVID-19  spread  and  the  number  of  new COVID-19  cases  increased  significantly,  particularly  in  the  U.S.,  demand  for  rapid  COVID-19  tests  increased significantly. As  a  result,  in  the  second  half  of  2021, Abbott  sold  approximately  $181  million  of  inventory  that  was previously  estimated  to  have  no  net  realizable  value  under  the  second  quarter  restructuring  action.  In  addition,  the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $58 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the second half of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $23 million and primarily represent severance obligations.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2021, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of  St.  Jude  Medical,  Inc.  (St.  Jude  Medical)  into  the  Medical  Devices  segment,  and  Alere  Inc.  (Alere)  into  the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2018, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $41 million. From 2019 to 2021, Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges totaling approximately $95 million, comprised of $10 million in 2021, $13 million in 2020, and $72 million in 2019. Approximately $31 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $5 million was  recorded  in  Research  and  development,  and  approximately  $59  million  was  recorded  in  Selling,  general  and administrative  expense  over  the  last  three  years. As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  accrued  liabilities  remaining  in  the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $9 million.\n\nFrom  2017  to  2020, Abbott  management  approved  plans  to  streamline  operations  in  order  to  reduce  costs  and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. As of December 31, 2018, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $70 million. From 2019 to 2020, Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges totaling approximately $102 million, comprised of $36  million  in  2020  and  $66  million  in  2019.  Approximately  $22  million  was  recorded  in  Cost  of  products  sold, approximately $30 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $50 million was recorded in Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  over  the  two  years.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  accrued  liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $24 million.",

Amgen reported $8.5 billion in cash flows from operating activities, which funded its acquisition of Horizon and dividend increases, highlighting a dual focus on strategic growth and shareholder returns. UnitedHealth generated $29.1 billion in cash flows from operating activities, using the funds to repurchase shares ($8 billion), pay dividends ($6.8 billion), and service debt, while also investing in acquisitions and maintaining strong liquidity.

      "answer": "AbbVie accounts for rebates as variable consideration in revenue recognition, estimating rebate amounts based on contractual or statutory pricing and historical data. CVS Health recognizes rebates in its Health Services segment as a reduction of cost of products sold when prescriptions are dispensed, typically billing manufacturers within 30 days of quarter-end. Gilead highlights that increased rebate obligations under the Inflation Reduction Act\u2014such as the 10% discount in the initial coverage phase and 20% discount in the catastrophic phase\u2014negatively impact profitability and financial results. Together, these disclosures illustrate how rebates affect revenue, cost of goods sold, and net pricing differently across the pharmaceutical value chain.",

(AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (i ncluding aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on reimbursement terms.\n\nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.\n\nAbbVie completed its previously announced acquisitions of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen) on February 12, 2024 and Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel Therapeutics) on August 1, 2024. See Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\n\n## Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling i nterest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, i nvoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less.\n\nCash discounts, rebates and chargebacks, sales incentives, product returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by",

          "chunk_text": "The cost of care provided within the Company's costs of products sold includes the costs incurred to operate the primary care centers and care model. These costs consist of care team and patient support employee-related costs, occupancy costs, patient transportation, medical supplies, insurance, fees paid to specialists and other operating costs.\n\n## Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness Segment\n\nCost of products sold includes: the cost of merchandise sold during the reporting period, including the costs of prescription drugs sold through its retail pharmacies, net of any volume-related or other discounts, the related purchasing costs, warehousing and delivery costs (including depreciation and amortization), the operating costs of the Company's specialty and mail order pharmacy fulfillment operations and inventory losses.\n\n## Vendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts\n\nThe Company accounts for vendor allowances and purchase discounts as follows:\n\n## Health Services Segment\n\nThe Health Services segment receives purchase discounts on pharmaceutical products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the Health Services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within 30 days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the Company's operating results or financial condition. The Company accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The Health Services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Health Services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold.\n\n## Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness Segment\n\nVendor allowances received by the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any amounts received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract based upon sales volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract. The total amortization of these upfront payments was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Advertising Costs\n\nAdvertising costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed when the related advertising takes place. Net advertising costs, which are included in operating expenses, were $989 million, $985 million and $745 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the stock award (generally three to five years) using the straight-line method.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax  consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the",

          "chunk_text": "## We face significant competition from global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialized pharmaceutical firms and generic drug manufacturers.\n\nNew branded or generic products entering major markets affects our ability to maintain pricing and market share. Our products compete with other available products based primarily on efficacy, safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease of use, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, distribution and marketing. A number of companies are pursuing the development of products and technologies that may be competitive with our existing products or research programs. These competing companies include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialized pharmaceutical firms acting either independently or together with other such companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection or may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs. We may be adversely impacted if any of these competitors gain market share as a result of new technologies, commercialization strategies or otherwise.\n\n## Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.\n\nSuccessful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability and amount of third-party payer reimbursement for our products and related treatments and medical services in the markets where we sell our products. As our products mature, pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers often result in a reduction of the net product prices.\n\nLegislative and regulatory actions affecting government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently. We may be adversely impacted by any such legislative and regulatory actions, though it is difficult to predict the impact, if any, on the use and reimbursement of our products.\n\nIn the U.S., the European Union ('EU') and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services. The volume of drug pricing-related legislation has dramatically increased in recent years, including:\n\n- U.S. Congress has enacted laws requiring manufacturer refunds on certain amounts of discarded drug from single-use vials and eliminating the existing cap on Medicaid rebate amounts beginning in 2024.\n- U.S. Congress has enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the 'IRA'), which, among other changes, (1) requires the Department of Health and Human Services to 'negotiate' Medicare prices for certain drugs (starting with 10 drugs in 2026, adding 15 drugs in 2027 and 2028, and adding 20 drugs in 2029 and subsequent years), which could also affect the Medicaid rebate obligations and the ceiling prices charged to covered entities under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act ('340B') if such prices are lower than the Medicaid Best Price; (2) imposes an inflation-based rebate on Medicare Part B utilization starting in 2023 and Part D utilization beginning October 1, 2022; and (3) restructures the Medicare Part D benefit to cap out-of-pocket expenses for Part D beneficiaries  beginning in 2024 and, effective  January 1, 2025, increases  Part  D plans' contributions in the catastrophic coverage phase and increases manufacturers' discount contributions across coverage phases such that manufacturers must pay a 10% discount in the initial coverage phase and a 20% discount in the catastrophic phase on drugs utilized by all Part D beneficiaries, including low income subsidy patients. Although none of our products were selected by the Department of Health and Human Services for 'negotiation' in 2026 or 2027, there is no assurance that our products will not be selected in the future. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the IRA on our business. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ('CMS') has issued a number of guidance documents, but it remains unclear how certain provisions of the IRA will be implemented. Additional guidance, legislation or rulemaking may be issued that could change the scope or implementation of the IRA. In addition, multiple manufacturers and trade organizations have challenged the Medicare 'negotiation' provisions of the IRA, and additional legal challenges may be filed in the future. While the full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain at this time, we anticipate that the IRA will increase our payment obligations under the redesigned Part D discount program, limit the prices we can charge for our products, and increase the rebates we must provide government programs for our products, thereby reducing our profitability and negatively impacting our financial results.",

      "answer": "In 2021, GILD reported right-of-use assets obtained of $88 million, MDT reported $230 million, and PFE reported $1,943 million. This indicates that PFE had significantly higher leasing activity compared to both GILD and MDT, suggesting a more aggressive use of operating leases to finance its operations. MDT\u2019s figure was more than double that of GILD\u2019s, pointing to a moderate but notable leasing strategy compared to GILD\u2019s minimal leasing activity.

      "answer": "Abbott reports long-term investments totaling $799 million in 2023, primarily composed of equity securities and other investments, showing a relatively modest allocation. Pfizer discloses significantly higher long-term investments of $3,731 million in 2023, including equity securities, private equity holdings, and debt instruments, indicating a more aggressive capital deployment strategy. Thermo Fisher, while not explicitly breaking out 'long-term investments,' reports consolidated long-lived assets of $11,004 million in 2023, which includes property, plant, and equipment, suggesting a focus on tangible asset investment rather than financial instruments. Together, these figures highlight distinct capital allocation philosophies: Abbott\u2019s conservative stance, Pfizer\u2019s diversified investment approach, and Thermo Fisher\u2019s emphasis on physical asset growth.",

      "question": "How do AMGN, CVS, and LLY differ in the impact of 'Less: Imputed Interest' on their respective lease liabilities, and what does this reveal about their lease financing strategies?",
      "answer": "AMGN reports a 'Less: Imputed Interest' of $167 million on total lease payments of $977 million, reducing its lease liabilities to $810 million. CVS shows a significantly larger imputed interest deduction of $717 million against total finance lease payments of $2,108 million, resulting in lease liabilities of $1,391 million. LLY presents an imputed interest of $284.8 million on total lease payments of $1,392.1 million, leading to a final lease liability of $1,107.4 million. These differences suggest that CVS relies more heavily on lease financing relative to its asset base or operational scale compared to AMGN and LLY, while LLY maintains a moderate approach. The variation in imputed interest impact reflects differing lease structures, financing decisions, or lease term durations across the three companies.",

      "question": "How do Abbott, CVS Health, and Merck each incorporate assumptions about health care cost trend rates in their financial planning, and what do their respective approaches reveal about the variability and strategic importance of these projections across different segments of the health care industry?",
      "answer": "Abbott discloses specific health care cost trend rate assumptions used in its postretirement benefit plans, projecting a 7% rate for the next year, declining gradually to 5% by 2026. CVS Health emphasizes the critical role of health care cost trend rates in estimating incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, using them to project future claim costs, especially for recent months. Merck includes health care cost trend rate assumptions as part of its other postretirement benefit plans, though it does not specify the exact rate, focusing instead on how these assumptions are evaluated alongside other actuarial factors. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies rely on health care cost trend rates, their application varies: Abbott and Merck use them for long-term liability estimation in benefit plans, while CVS applies them dynamically in short- and medium-term claims forecasting, highlighting the multifaceted role of these rates across the health care ecosystem.",

Management fees charged to contract holders are included in services revenue and recognized over the period earned.\n\n## Health Care Costs Payable\n\nHealth care costs payable consist principally of unpaid fee-for-service medical, dental and pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing arrangements related to the Health Care Benefits segment's Insured Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products and accruals for state assessments. Unpaid health care claims include an estimate of payments the Company will make for (i) services rendered to the Company's Insured members but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively, 'IBNR'). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. Such estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider, among other things, historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, assumed and historical medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in Insured membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company reflects changes in these estimates in benefit costs in the Company's consolidated operating results in the period they are determined. Capitation costs represent contractual monthly fees paid to participating physicians and other medical providers for providing medical care, regardless of the volume of medical services provided to the Insured member. Amounts due under risksharing arrangements are based on the terms of the underlying contracts with the providers and consider claims experience under the contracts through the financial statement date.\n\nThe Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. Of those factors, the Company considers the analysis of historical and projected claim payment patterns (including claims submission and processing patterns) and the assumed health care cost trend rate (the year-over-year change in per member per month health care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. In developing its IBNR estimate, the Company consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company's estimate of IBNR in 2021.\n\nThe Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to estimate 'completion factors.' The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all claims are paid within six months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid. These historically-derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents the Company's estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company's health care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser extent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership and changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using the Company's completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.\n\nBecause claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derived completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarial judgment and places a greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced by seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix.\n\nThe Company's health care cost trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such services. Many factors influence the health care cost trend rate, including the Company's ability to manage benefit costs through product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs, as well as the mix of the Company's business. The health status of the Company's Insured members, aging of the population and other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per member utilization and unit costs. Changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies, increases in the cost of",

The expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid and is determined on a plan basis. The expected rate of return for each plan is developed considering long-term historical returns data, current market conditions, and actual returns on the plan assets. Using this reference information, the long-term return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected return for each plan's target portfolio is developed according to the allocation among those investment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. For 2022, the expected rate of return for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will be 6.70%, as compared to a range of 6.50% to 6.70% in 2021.\n\nThe health care cost trend rate assumptions for other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How do AbbVie, Abbott, and UnitedHealth each reflect the role of net earnings in their financial performance, and what does this reveal about their respective cost structures and operational efficiency in 2022?",
      "answer": "AbbVie's net earnings are significantly impacted by rebate expenses, which totaled $33.9 billion in 2021, reducing revenue and requiring complex accrual management. Abbott reports net earnings of $7,071 million in 2021, which are reconciled to operating cash flow through adjustments like depreciation and share-based compensation, indicating a capital-intensive and R&D-driven model. UnitedHealth highlights that even a 1% increase in medical costs could reduce annual net earnings by $330 million, showing high sensitivity to cost control and underwriting accuracy. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies report net earnings, their financial health is shaped differently by cost structures\u2014rebates for AbbVie, capital and R&D costs for Abbott, and medical cost sensitivity for UnitedHealth.",

Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $33.9 billion in 2021, $27.0 billion in 2020 and $18.8 billion in 2019. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\n\nIn order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.\n\nThe following table is an analysis of the three largest accruals for rebates and chargebacks, which comprise approximately 95% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2021. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on certain Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the commercial and Medicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, such as COVID-19, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2021 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1% higher than our actual medical costs, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2021 would have been reduced by approximately $330 million, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur business depends on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members, customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. The volume of health care data generated, and the uses of data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding. Our ability to implement new and innovative services, price adequately our products and services, provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. In addition, connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience failures in our health, wellness and information technology products; lose existing customers; have difficulty attracting new customers; experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals; become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties; incur increases in operating expenses; or suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems' capabilities as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems' capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nCertain of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nUncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to health data and the health information technology market may alter the competitive landscape or present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market.\n\nIf we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents resulting in security breaches disrupting our operations or resulting in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential",

      "question": "How do Abbott, Amgen, and Merck each account for contingent milestone payments in their R&D and collaboration agreements, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to financial risk and partnership structures in drug development?",
      "answer": "Abbott accounts for contingent milestone payments by expensing them when the milestone results are achieved under third-party research and development arrangements, reflecting a straightforward accrual approach tied directly to performance outcomes. Amgen discloses potential milestone payments of up to $850 million contingent on regulatory and commercial thresholds in its collaboration with Kyowa Kirin, indicating a high-stakes, contingent liability structure tied to external validation and market success. Merck, in contrast, received a $20 million regulatory approval milestone payment in 2023 as part of its collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb and is eligible for up to $80 million more in sales-based milestones, showing a more revenue-positive orientation where milestones serve as upside incentives rather than cost obligations. Together, these reveal differing strategic postures: Abbott\u2019s internal cost control, Amgen\u2019s risk-sharing with high contingent liabilities, and Merck\u2019s focus on milestone receipts as upside in co-commercialization partnerships.",

Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nConsumables revenues consist of single-use products and are recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer-lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues (primarily clinical research, pharmaceutical, and instrument and enterprise services) are recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services. For revenues recognized over time, the company generally uses costs accumulated relative to total estimated costs to measure progress as this method approximates satisfaction of the performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration to which it expects to be entitled (i.e., the transaction price) to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenues when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. The company exercises judgment in determining the timing of revenue by analyzing the point in time or the period over which the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the asset. The company immediately expenses contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year.\n\nChanges to the scope of services contracts generally also include changes in the transaction price. Typically, these contract modifications are not distinct from existing services provided under the contract, and result in cumulative adjustments to revenue on the modification date. However, some modifications are distinct from existing services provided under the contract and recognized prospectively.\n\nPayments from customers for most instruments and consumables are typically due in a fixed number of days after shipment or delivery of the product. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g., extended service contracts), upon completion of the service (e.g., pharmaceutical services) or a mix  of both. Some arrangements include variable amounts of consideration that arise from discounts, rebates, and other programs and practices. In such arrangements, the company estimates the amount by which to reduce the stated contract amount to reflect the transaction price. The company records reimbursement for third-party pass-through and out-of-pocket costs as revenues and the related expenses as costs of revenues.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nThe company conducts research and development activities to increase its depth of capabilities in technologies, software and services. Research and development costs include employee compensation and benefits, consultants, facilities related costs, material costs, depreciation and travel. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Restructuring Costs\n\nAccounting for the timing and amount of termination benefits provided by the company to employees is determined based on whether: (a) the company has a substantive plan to provide such benefits, (b) the company has a written employment contract with the affected employees that includes a provision for such benefits, (c) the termination benefits are due to the occurrence of an event specified in an ex isting plan or agreement, or (d) the termination benefits are a one-time benefit. In certain circumstances, employee termination benefits may meet more than one of the characteristics listed above and therefore, may have individual elements that are subject to different accounting models.\n\nFrom time to time when executing a restructuring or exit plan, the company also incurs costs other than termination benefits, such as lease termination costs, that are not associated with or will not be incurred to provide economic benefits to the company. These include costs that represent amounts under contractual obligations that exist prior to the restructuring plan communication date and will either continue after the restructuring plan is completed with no economic benefit or result in a penalty to cancel a contractual obligation. Such costs are recognized when incurred, which generally occurs at the contract termination or over the period from when a plan to abandon a leased facility is approved through the cease-use date but charges may continue over the remainder of the original contractual period.\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Except where the result would be antidilutive to net income",

The sales increase was primarily due to growth in oncology , cardiovascular and animal health, partially offset by declines in diabetes, virology (driven largely by lower sales of COVID-19 medication Lagevrio ), immunology (as M erck's marketing rights to these products ended in 2024) and vaccines.\n\nMerck continues to execute value creating business development opportunities focused on innovation to augment its robust internal pipeline with compelling external science. Highlights of 2024 activity include the following:\n\n- Closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize M K-2010 (LM -299), a novel investigational programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/vascular endothelial growth factor (V EGF) bispecific antibody from LaNova M edicines Ltd (LaNova).\n- Closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize  M K-4082 (HS-10535), an investigational preclinical oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist from Hansoh Pharma (Hansoh).\n- Acquired global rights to M K-1045 (formerly CN201), a novel investigational clinical-stage bispecific antibody for the treatment of B-cell associated diseases from Curon Pharmaceutical (Curon).\n- Acquired Eyebiotech Limited (EyeBio), a privately held ophthalmology-focused biotechnology company developing candidates for the prevention and treatment of vision loss.\n\n\u2022\n\nAcquired Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc. (Harpoon), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T-cell engagers designed to harness the power of the body's immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases.\n\nDuring 2024, M erck continued its efforts to address unmet medical needs by launching new products with significant patient benefit, including the U.S. launches of Winrevair , for the treatment of certain adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA H), and Capvaxive, for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Winrevair was also approved in the EU.\n\nThe Company received more than 25 regulatory approvals in major markets in 2024, including the Winrevair and Capvaxive approvals noted above, along  with  numerous  approvals  in  oncology . Keytruda receiv ed  approval  for  additional  indications  in  the  U.S.  and/or  internationally   as  monotherapy   in  the therapeutic areas of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma and urothelial carcinoma, in combination with chemotherapy in the therapeutic areas of biliary tract cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial carcinoma, gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma and nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as in combination with Padcev (enfortunab vedotin-ejfv) for advanced urothelial carcinoma. A lso in 2024, Welireg was approved in China for the treatment of adult patients with certain von Hippel-Lindau (V HL) disease-associated tumors not requiring immediate surgery . Lynparza, which is being developed in collaboration with A straZeneca PLC (A straZeneca), received approval in China for the treatment of certain adult patients with germline BRCA -mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative high-risk early breast cancer.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory approvals discussed above, the Company advanced its late-stage pipeline with several regulatory submissions.\n\n- MK-1022, patritumab deruxtecan, is a potential first-in-class HER3 directed DX d antibody drug conjugate (A DC), under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated NSCLC previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. In June 2024, the FDA  issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the Biologics License A pplication (BLA ) due to findings pertaining to an inspection of a third-party manufacturing facility . The CRL did not identify any issues with the efficacy or safety data submitted. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DX d) was discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and is",

In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R &amp;D  efforts seek to add value to our existing products by im proving their safety, efficacy and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications.\n\nOur R&amp;D Priorities and Strategy. Our R&amp;D priorities include:\n\n- delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated m edicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the m ost im portant new therapies to patients in need;\n- advancing our capabilities that can position us for long-term  R &amp;D  leadership; and\n- advancing new m odels for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.\n\nTo that end, our R &amp;D  prim arily focuses on our m ain therapeutic areas, which are oncology, internal m edicine (including cardiovascular and m igraine), vaccines and inflam m ation and im m unology.\n\nWhile a significant portion of our R &amp;D  is internal, we also seek prom ising chem ical and biological lead m olecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into our discovery and developm ent processes or projects, as well as our portfolio. W e do so by entering into collaboration, alliance and license agreem ents with universities, biotechnology com panies and other firm s as well as through acquisitions and investm ents. T hese arrangem ents allow us to share knowledge, risk and cost. T hey also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise, as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and in-licensed or acquired products. For inform ation on certain of these collaborations, alliances and license arrangem ents and investm ents, see Note 2 .\n\nOur R&amp;D Operations. I n 2024, we continued to enhance our global R &amp;D  operations and pursued strategies to im prove R &amp;D  productivity and advance a sustainable and value-creating pipeline. O ncology was organized in an end-to-end O ncology R &amp;D  (O R D ) organization, spanning discovery to late-phase clinical developm ent. P fizer R esearch and D evelopm ent (P R D ) m anaged the sam e for our rem aining therapeutic areas in addition to certain platform  organizations. E ffective January 1, 2025, O R D  and P R D  were consolidated into a single R&amp;D organization to further strengthen P fizer's capabilities and leadership in discovering and developing breakthrough m edicines and vaccines. As part of these changes, we are now evaluating how our sim plified structure and sharpened focus m ight lead to im provem ents in productivity and potential efficiencies. W e expect any potential savings identified through these efforts to be reinvested in our R &amp;D  portfolio.\n\nWe manage R&amp;D operations on a total-com pany basis through the organizations described above. The P ortfolio M anagem ent Team  (P M T), currently chaired by our C hief Strategy and I nnovation O fficer, E xecutive Vice P resident, is accountable for aligning resources across R &amp;D , and for helping to ensure optim al capital allocation across the R &amp;D  portfolio. W e believe that this approach also serves to m axim ize accountability and flexibility.\n\nWe do not disaggregate total R &amp;D  expense by developm ent phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we m anage our R &amp;D  strategy and operations collectively under the governance of the P M T and do not m anage our R &amp;D  operational spend independently by developm ent phase or by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, we believe that any prior-period inform ation about R &amp;D  expense by developm ent phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.\n\nFor additional inform ation on our R &amp;D  operations, including R &amp;D  related costs and expenses, see the Costs and Expenses -Research and Development Expenses section within MD&amp;A and Note 17 .\n\nOur R&amp;D Pipeline. The process of drug, vaccine and biological product discovery from  initiation through developm ent and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take m ore than ten years. As of February 4, 2025, we had the following num ber of projects in various stages of R &amp;D :\n\nDevelopm ent of a single com pound is often pursued as part of m ultiple program s. W hile our product candidates m ay or m ay not receive regulatory approval, new candidates entering clinical developm ent phases are the foundation for future products. Inform ation concerning several of our drug, vaccine and biological candidates in developm ent, as well as supplem ental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Product Developments section within M D &amp;A. T he discovery and developm ent of drugs, vaccines and biological products are tim e consum ing, costly and unpredictable.\n\nFor inform ation on the risks associated with R &amp;D , see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Research and Development section.\n\n## COLLABORATION AND CO-PROMOTION AGREEMENTS\n\nWe use collaboration and/or co-prom otion arrangem ents to enhance our developm ent, R &amp;D , sales and distribution of certain biopharm aceutical products, which include, am ong others, the following:\n\n- Comirnaty is an m R N A-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent C O VID -19, which is being jointly developed and com m ercialized with BioN T ech. P fizer and BioN T ech equally share the costs of developm ent for the C om irnaty program .

The intellectual property license and supply obligations related to the G ilead Compounds are accounted for as a single performance obligation. As the license was deemed to be the predominant item to which the revenue share relates, we recognize our share of the Symtuza revenue in the period when the corresponding sales of Symtuza by Janssen occur. We record our share of the Symtuza revenue as Product sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations primarily because we supply the Gilead Compounds to Janssen for Symtuza.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including withdrawal of a product from the market, material breach by either party or expiry of the revenue share payment term. Janssen may terminate the agreement without cause on a country-by-country basis, in which case Gilead has the right to become the selling party for such country(ies) if the product has launched but has been on the market for fewer than 10 years. Janssen may also terminate the entire agreement without cause.\n\n## Japan Tobacco\n\nIn 2005, Japan Tobacco, Inc. ('Japan Tobacco') granted us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir, a novel HIV  integrase inhibitor, in all countries of the world, excluding Japan, where Japan Tobacco retained such rights. Effective December 2018, we entered into an agreement with Japan Tobacco to acquire the rights to market and distribute certain products in our HIV  portfolio in Japan and to ex pand our rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir to include Japan. We are responsible for the marketing of the products as of January 1, 2019.\n\nWe are responsible for seeking regulatory approval in our territories and are required to use diligent efforts to commercialize elvitegravir for the treatment of HIV infection. We bear all costs and expenses associated with such commercialization efforts and pay a royalty to Japan Tobacco based on our product sales. Our sales of these products are included in Product sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Royalties due to Japan Tobacco are included in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Royalty expenses recognized were $139 million, $167 million and $198 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nUnder the terms of the 2018 agreement, we paid Japan Tobacco $559 million in cash and recognized an intangible asset of $550 million reflecting the estimated fair value of the marketing-related rights acquired from Japan Tobacco. The intangible asset is being amortized over nine years, representing the period over which the majority of the benefits are ex pected to be derived from the applicable products in our HIV  portfolio. The amortization ex pense is classified as selling ex pense and recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nTermination of the agreement may be on a product or country basis and will depend on the circumstances, including material breach by either party or expiry of royalty payment term. We may also terminate the entire agreement without cause.\n\n## Everest\n\nIn April 2019, Everest Medicines ('Everest') and Immunomedics entered into an agreement granting Everest an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Trodelvy in  G reater  China,  South  Korea,  Singapore,  Indonesia,  Philippines,  V ietnam,  Thailand,  Malaysia  and  Mongolia  (the  'Territories').  G ilead  subsequently acquired Immunomedics in October 2020 and assumed the Everest license and supply agreement, which provided for certain sales milestones and royalties payments to  be  made to  G ilead  and  was  recorded  as  a  $175  million  finite-lived  asset  as  part  of  the  purchase  accounting.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022,  we  reacquired  all development and commercialization rights for Trodelvy from Everest and terminated the previous agreement. Under the terms of the new agreement, G ilead made $280 million in upfront termination payments to Everest, of which $84 million was made in 2022 and $196 million was made in 2023. In addition, Everest is eligible to receive up to $175 million in potential additional payments upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. We accounted for the new agreement as a contract termination, which includes the reacquisition of commercial rights and the settlement of our pre-existing relationship with Everest. As a result, we recorded an expense of $406 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022, which primarily represents the upfront costs and write-off of the remaining value of the pre-existing asset related to the prior agreement. Simultaneously, we recorded an acquired finite-lived asset with a fair value of $50 million for the commercial rights reacquired for products approved in the Territories.",

          "chunk_text": "We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that hav e a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to hav e a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, rev enues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in dev elopment and enter into research and dev elopment arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future ev ents linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achiev ement of an important point in the dev elopment life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approv al for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achiev ement of certain sales lev els). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the ev ent that regulatory approv al for marketing is obtained.\n\nIndiv idually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. Howev er, if milestones for multiple products cov ered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectiv ely, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often giv e us the discretion to unilaterally terminate dev elopment of the product, which would allow us to av oid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease dev elopment if the compound successfully achiev es milestone objectiv es. We v iew these payments as positiv e because they signify that the product is successfully mov ing through dev elopment and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.\n\n## APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjectiv e and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any giv en indiv idual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could dev elop different estimates. We believ e that, giv en current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adv erse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates hav e been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\n\n## Background and Uncertainties\n\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product rev enue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, prov isions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on rev enue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\n\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receiv e under these types of contracts.",

      "answer": "Abbott discloses that foreign currency forward contracts, totaling $8.6 billion in 2021, directly impact its cost of products sold when products are sold, reflecting exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. Johnson & Johnson reports that its Global Supply Chain restructuring efforts, which included a $0.1 billion charge to cost of products sold in 2021, aim to improve cost-competitiveness and generate $0.6\u20130.8 billion in annual pre-tax savings by 2022.

          "chunk_text": "In  June  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2016-13, Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses ,  which  changes  the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 - A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nUnder the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental,  technological  and  other  factors  that  may  affect  Abbott's  operations  are  discussed  in  Item  1A,  Risk Factors.\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Financial Instruments and Risk Management\n\n## Market Price Sensitive Investments\n\nThe fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $11 million and $20 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2021 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in  earnings.  The  fair  value  of  investments  in  mutual  funds  that  are  held  in  a  rabbi  trust  for  the  purpose  of  paying benefits  under  a  deferred  compensation  plan  was  approximately  $391  million  and  $366  million  as  of  December  31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these  investments,  as  well  as  an  offsetting  change  in  the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.\n\n## Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities\n\nAbbott  holds  equity  securities  that  are  not  traded  on  public  stock  exchanges.  The  carrying  value  of  these investments  was  $90  million  and  $113  million  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  No  individual investment  is  recorded  at  a  value  in  excess  of  $15  million.  Abbott  measures  these  investments  at  cost  minus impairment,  if  any,  plus  or  minus  changes  resulting  from  observable  price  changes  in  orderly  transactions  for  the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n## Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nAt  December  31,  2021  and  2020, Abbott  had  interest  rate  hedge  contracts  totaling  $2.9  billion  to  manage  its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at  December 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $21.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.4% and 3.3% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values.\n\n## Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  for  anticipated  intercompany  purchases  by  those  subsidiaries  whose  functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott held $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2021 will mature in 2022 or 2023 depending upon the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2020 matured in 2021 or will mature in 2022 depending upon the contract.",

Restructuring\n\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program.\n\nIn total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2021:\n\n",

The existence of the warning letter may limit our ability to launch certain new Diabetes products in the U.S. prior to resolution of the findings.\n- Our ability  to  successfully  develop,  obtain  regulatory  approval  of  and  commercialize  the  products  within  our  pipeline,  which include, but are not limited to, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump and the Guardian 4 sensor, which have been submitted to the U.S. FDA.\n\n## COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\nThe following is a summary of cost of products sold, research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales:\n\nCost  of  Products  Sold We  continue  to  focus  on  reducing  our  costs  of  production  through  supplier  management,  manufacturing improvements, and optimizing our manufacturing network. Cost of products sold for fiscal year 2022 was $10.1 billion as compared to $10.5 billion for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was largely due to the conditions of the pandemic during fiscal year 2021, which resulted in recognizing a portion of our fixed overhead costs as period expenses, increases in our reserves in our excess and obsolete inventory, as well as negative impact from mix, as products in higher demand had lower gross margins. The decrease was also attributable to charges from field correction actions in the prior year. Fiscal year 2022 included $58 million of inventory  write-downs  associated  with  our  June  2021  decision  to  stop  the  distribution  and  sale  of  Medtronic's  HV AD  System  (MCS charges). Looking forward, our cost of products sold likely will be further negatively impacted by inflation and higher labor and direct material costs.\n\nResearch and Development Expense We remain committed to deliver the best possible experiences for every patient, physician, and caregiver we serve; to create technologies that expand what's possible across the entire human body to transform lives; to turn data and insights  into  real  action  to  serve  real  patient  needs,  dramatically  improving  care;  and  to  expand  healthcare  access  and  deliver  positive outcomes that go far beyond our products. Research and development expense for fiscal year 2022 was $2.7 billion as compared to $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2021. Fiscal year 2022 included $101 million of acquisitions of, and license payments for, technology not approved by regulators, primarily in our Diabetes segment.\n\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense Our goal is to continue to leverage selling, general, and administrative expense initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages, other administrative costs, such as professional fees and marketing expenses, and certain acquisition and restructuring expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expense for fiscal year 2022 was $10.3 billion as compared to $10.1 billion for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of  net  sales  was  primarily  driven  by  net  sales  growth  as  a  result  of  the  recovery  of  procedural  volumes  partially  offset  by increases in employee travel as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year when travel was limited.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues consist primarily of royalty income and corporate partner revenues. Royalties from licensees are based on third-party sales of licensed products and are recorded when the related third-party product sale occurs. Royalty income is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends. Corporate partner revenues are  composed  mainly  of  license  fees  and  milestones  earned  and  our  share  of  commercial  profits  generated  from  collaborations.  See Arrangements  with  multipleperformance obligations, discussed below.\n\n## Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into arrangements for the R&amp;D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and product candidates. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or goods, including intellectual property rights/licenses, R&amp;D services, manufacturing services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to Amgen in the form of nonrefundable, upfront license fees; development and commercial-performance milestone payments; royalty payments; and/or profit sharing.\n\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or by using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\n\nThe  consideration  allocated  to  each  distinct  performance  obligation  is  recognized  as  revenue  when  control  of  the  related  goods  or  services  is  transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will  not  occur.  We  utilize  the  sales-  and  usage-based  royalty  ex ception  in  arrangements  that  resulted  from  the  license  of  intellectual  property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nR&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical  manufacturing  costs;  contract  services  and  other  outside  costs;  information  systems'  costs;  and  amortization  of  acquired  technology  used  in  R&amp;D  with alternative future uses. R&amp;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with third-party R&amp;D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&amp;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSG&amp;A costs are primarily composed of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel;  facilities  and  overhead  costs;  outside  marketing,  advertising  and  legal  ex penses;  the  U.S.  healthcare  reform  federal  ex cise  fee  on  Branded  Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $987 million, $647 million and $841  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  SG &amp;A  ex penses  also  include  costs  and  cost  recoveries  associated  with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG &amp;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract,  we  determine  whether  an  arrangement  is  or  contains  a  lease.  For  all  leases,  we  determine  the  classification  as  either  operating  or financing. Operating leases are included in Other noncurrent assets, Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Lease recognition occurs at the commencement date, and lease liability amounts are based on the present value of lease payments made during the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Because most of our leases do not provide information to determine an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of",

Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely .\n\nRoyalty income in 2024 on patent and know-how licenses and other rights amounted to $1.1 billion. M erck also incurred royalty expenses amounting to $1.9 billion in 2024 under patent and know-how licenses it holds.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nThe Company's business is characterized by the introduction of new products or new uses for existing products through a strong research and development program. A t December 31, 2024, approximately 23,500 people were employed in the Company's research activities. The Company prioritizes its research and development efforts and focuses on candidates that it believes represent breakthrough science for unmet medical needs that will make a difference for patients and payers.\n\nThe Company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs  directed  toward  product  development.  The  Company's  research  and  development  model  is  designed  to  increase  productivity  and  improve  the probability  of  success  by  prioritiz ing  the  Company's  research  and  development  resources  on  candidates  the  Company  believes  are  capable  of  providing unambiguous, promotable advantages to patients and payers and delivering the maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. M erck is pursuing emerging product opportunities independent of therapeutic area or modality . The Company is committed to ensuring that  ex ternally   sourced  programs  remain  an  important  component  of  its  pipeline  strategy ,  with  a  focus  on  supplementing  its  internal  research  through acquisitions as well as a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as access to new technologies.\n\nThe Company's clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, neurosciences, immunology, ophthalmology, respiratory diseases, and vaccines.\n\nIn the development of human health products, industry practice and government regulations in the U.S. and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. Before a new drug or vaccine may be marketed in the U.S., recorded data on preclinical and clinical experience are included in the New Drug A pplication (NDA ) for a drug or the Biologics License Application (BLA) for a vaccine or biologic submitted to the FDA  for the required approval.\n\nOnce the Company's scientists discover a new small molecule compound or biologic that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition, the Company commences preclinical  testing  with  that  compound.  Preclinical  testing  includes  laboratory  testing  and  animal  safety  studies  to  gather  data  on chemistry ,  pharmacology ,  immunogenicity  and  toxicology .  Pending  acceptable  preclinical  data,  the  Company  will  initiate  clinical  testing  in  accordance  with established regulatory requirements. The clinical testing begins with Phase 1 studies, which are designed to assess safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics, and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans. If favorable, additional, larger Phase 2 studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population, define appropriate dosing for the compound, as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound's usefulness. In some situations, the clinical program incorporates adaptive design methodology to use accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of the ongoing clinical study as it continues, without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. One type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2a/2b trial design, a two-stage trial design consisting of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept stage and a Phase 2b dose-optimization finding stage. If data from the Phase 2 trials are satisfactory , the Company commences large-scale Phase 3 trials to confirm the compound's efficacy and safety . A nother type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design, a study that includes an interim analysis and an adaptation that changes the trial from having features common in a Phase 2 study (e.g., multiple dose groups) to a design similar to a Phase 3 trial. A n adaptive Phase 2/3 trial design reduces timelines by eliminating activities which would be required to start a separate study . Upon completion of Phase 3 trials, if satisfactory , the Company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing. There can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed.\n\nVaccine development follows the same general pathway as for drugs. Preclinical testing focuses on the vaccine's safety and ability to elicit a protective immune response (immunogenicity). Pre-marketing vaccine clinical trials are typically done in three phases. Initial Phase 1 clinical studies are conducted in normal subjects to evaluate the safety , tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate. Phase 2 studies are dose-ranging studies and provide additional data on safety, immunogenicity and/or effectiveness. Finally, Phase 3 trials are conducted in the",

Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. As a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe $2.2 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher cash collections and timing of payments in the ordinary course of business, lower Celgene restructuring and integration payments ($400 million) and cash settlement of MyoKardia unvested stock awards in 2020 ($500 million), partially offset by reversion of post-retirement plan assets ($300 million) in 2020.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash  requirements  from  investing  activities  include  cash  used  for  acquisitions,  manufacturing  and  facility-related  capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase, proceeds from  business  divestitures  (including  royalties),  the  sale  and  maturity  of  marketable  securities,  sale  of  equity  investments  and upfront and contingent milestones from licensing arrangements.\n\nThe $10.3 billion change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2020 was due to lower licensing and asset acquisition payments of $11.5 billion primarily resulting from the MyoKardia acquisition in 2020 and higher proceeds from sales of equity investments of approximately $2.4 billion in 2021, partially offset by changes in the amount of marketable debt securities held of $3.4 billion.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt  and  other  borrowings  reduced  by  proceeds  from  the  exercise  of  stock  options  and  issuance  of  long-term  debt  and  other borrowings.\n\nThe  $15.1  billion  change  in  cash  flow  from  financing  activities  compared  to  2020  was  primarily  due  to  debt  issuances  of approximately $7.0 billion to partially fund the MyoKardia acquisition in 2020, higher debt repayments of $3.3 billion, including a series of tender offer and 'make whole' redemptions, and higher share repurchases of $4.7 billion in 2021.",

The higher cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in 2021 reflects stronger operating performance. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations includes upfront and milestone payments related  to  collaborations  of  $435  million  in  2021,  $2.9  billion  in  2020  and  $805  million  in  2019.  Cash  provided  by  operating activities  of  continuing  operations  continues  to  be  the  Company's  source  of  funds  to  finance  operating  needs,  with  excess  cash serving as the primary source of funds to finance capital expenditures, treasury stock purchases and dividends paid to shareholders.\n\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $16.4 billion in 2021 compared with $9.2 billion in 2020. The  higher  use  of  cash  in  investing  activities  of  continuing  operations  was  primarily  due  to  higher  cash  used  for  acquisitions, including for the acquisition of Acceleron, and lower proceeds from sales of securities and other investments, partially offset by the 2020  purchase  of  Seagen  common  stock.  Cash  used  in  investing  activities  of  continuing  operations  was  $9.2  billion  in  2020 compared with $2.5 billion in 2019. The increase was driven primarily by lower proceeds from the sales of securities and other investments, higher use of cash for acquisitions, higher capital expenditures and the purchase of Seagen common stock, partially offset by lower purchases of securities and other investments.\n\nCash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $3.1 billion in 2021 compared with a use of cash in financing  activities  of  continuing  operations  of  $2.8  billion  in  2020.  The  change  was  primarily  driven  by  the  cash  distribution received from Organon in connection with the spin-off (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), higher proceeds from the issuance of debt (see below) and lower purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by a net decrease in short-term borrowings in 2021 compared with a net increase in short-term borrowings in 2020, higher payments on debt (see below) and higher dividends paid to shareholders. Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $2.8 billion in 2020 compared with $8.9 billion in 2019. The lower use of cash in financing activities of continuing operations was driven primarily by a net increase in short-term borrowings in 2020 compared with a net decrease in short-term borrowing in 2019, as well as lower purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by higher payments on debt (see below), lower proceeds from the issuance of debt (see below), higher dividends paid to shareholders and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\n\nIn  December  2021,  the  Company  issued  $8.0  billion  principal  amount  of  senior  unsecured  notes  consisting  of $1.5 billion of 1.70% notes due 2027, $1.0 billion of 1.90% notes due 2028, $2.0 billion of 2.15% notes due 2031, $2.0 billion of 2.75% notes due 2051 and $1.5 billion of 2.90% notes due 2061. Merck used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2027 notes, the  2031  notes,  the  2051  notes  and  the  2061  notes  for  general  corporate  purposes,  including  the  repayment  of  outstanding commercial paper borrowings (including commercial paper borrowings in connection with Merck's acquisition of Acceleron), and other indebtedness. Merck allocated an amount equal to the net proceeds of the offering of the notes due in 2028 to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, projects and partnerships in the Company's priority ESG areas.\n\nIn June 2020, the Company issued $4.5 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $1.0 billion of 0.75% notes due 2026, $1.25 billion of 1.45% notes due 2030, $1.0 billion of 2.35% notes due 2040 and $1.25 billion of 2.45% notes  due  2050.  Merck  used  the  net  proceeds  from  the  offering  for  general  corporate  purposes,  including  the  repayment  of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and other indebtedness.\n\nIn March 2019, the Company issued $5.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $750 million of 2.90% notes due 2024, $1.75 billion of 3.40% notes due 2029, $1.0 billion of 3.90% notes due 2039, and $1.5 billion of 4.00% notes due 2049. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings.\n\nIn February 2022, the Company's $1.25 billion, 2.35% notes matured in accordance with their terms and were repaid. In 2021, the Company's $1.15 billion, 3.875% notes and the Company's \u20ac1.0 billion, 1.125% notes matured in accordance with their terms  and  were  repaid.  In  2020,  the  Company's  $1.25  billion,  1.85%  notes  and  $700  million  floating-rate  notes  matured  in accordance with their terms and were repaid.",

      "question": "How do ABT, AMGN, and JNJ each characterize the impact of 'Other (income) expense, net' on their financial performance, and what does this reveal about their respective exposure to non-operational financial volatility?",
      "answer": "ABT reported 'Other (income) expense, net' as a net gain of $376 million in 2024, contributing positively to earnings before taxes. In contrast, JNJ recorded a significant net expense of $4,694 million in 2024 under the same category, negatively impacting its earnings before taxes. AMGN, while not providing a specific dollar figure, attributed changes in 'Other income (expense), net' to gains from its BeiGene investment and higher interest income due to increased cash balances and interest rates. These differences highlight ABT\u2019s relatively low exposure to financial volatility, JNJ\u2019s notable sensitivity to one-time or external financial costs, and AMGN\u2019s strategic investment-driven variability in non-operational income.",

          "chunk_text": "The change in Other income (expense), net, for 2023    was primarily due to gains recognized in connection with recording our BeiG ene investment at fair value and an increase in interest income due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates as compared to the prior year.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for 2024 compared with 2023 was primarily due to a change in earnings mix, including the net unrealized impact of our strategic equity investments, partially offset by the deferred tax  adjustments associated with U.S. minimum tax on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n\nAs previously reported, the  OECD reached an agreement to align countries on a minimum corporate tax rate and an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries. As of January 1, 2025, select individual countries, including the United Kingdom, EU member countries and Singapore, have enacted the global minimum tax agreement. Our legal entities in the countries that have enacted the agreement, along with their direct and indirect subsidiaries, are now subject to a 15% minimum tax rate on adjusted financial statement income. Other countries, including the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, have not yet enacted the OECD agreement and implementation remains highly uncertain. The continued enactment of the agreement, either by all OECD participants or unilaterally by individual countries, could result in tax  increases or double tax ation in the United States or foreign jurisdictions.\n\nA 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change replaced the excise tax with an income tax, beginning in 2023. As of January 1, 2023, we are no longer subject to a 4% excise tax in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico. We qualify for and are subject to the alternative income tax rate on industrial development income of our Puerto Rico affiliate. In the United States, this income tax  qualifies for foreign tax  credits under the U.S. Treasury final foreign tax  credit regulations. See Part IV -Note 7, Income tax es, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\nIn 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010-2012, proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2021, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest two duplicate Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) for the years 2010-2012 that we received in May and July 2021, which seek to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2010-2012 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $3.6 billion plus interest. Any additional tax  that could be imposed for the years 20102012 would be reduced by up to approximately $900 million of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.\n\nIn 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013-2015, also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010-2012. We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013-2015 that we previously reported receiving in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013-2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $5.1 billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $2.0 billion. Any additional tax  that could be imposed for the years 2013-2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $2.2 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.\n\nWe firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010-2012 and 2013-2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010-2012 and 2013-2015 Notices through the judicial process. The two cases were consolidated in the U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022. The trial began on November 4, 2024 and concluded on January 17, 2025. With the conclusion of the trial, the parties will file post-trial briefs and make closing arguments in 2025. The Company expects a decision from the U.S. Tax Court no earlier than 2026.\n\nWe are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016-2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. We believe that the IRS may also seek to continue to audit similar issues related to the allocation of income between the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico for years beyond 2018. In addition, we are under examination by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.\n\nFinal resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the nex t 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax  law , application of the tax  law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax  authorities; however, due to the complex ity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.",

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) highlights that increasing generic and biosimilar competition, along with potential government 'march-in rights' on drug pricing, poses a material negative impact on its revenues and earnings. Danaher (DHR) notes that impairment charges, such as a $265 million pretax charge in 2024 for indefinite-lived trade names, could adversely affect its net earnings if fair values decline further.

          "chunk_text": "In some cases, manufacturers may seek regulatory approval by submitting their own clinical study data to obtain marketing approval or choose to launch a generic product 'at risk' before the expiration of the applicable patent(s) and/or before the final resolution of related patent litigation.  In addition, some countries are allowing manufacturers to manufacture and sell generic products, which negatively impacts the protections afforded the Company. Lower-priced generics or biosimilars for BMS biologic products or competing biologics could negatively impact our volumes and prices.\n\nIn addition, both the U.S. Congress and the FDA have taken steps to promote the development and approval of generic drugs and biosimilar biologics, including by providing generic and biosimilar developers a private right of action to obtain sufficient quantities of drug samples from the reference product' s manufacturer in order to conduct testing necessary to obtain approval for generic or biosimilar products.\n\nIn addition, in December 2023, the Biden administration released a proposed framework that for the first time proposed that a drug' s price can be a factor in determining that the drug is not accessible to the public and, therefore, that the government could exercise 'march-in rights' and license it to a third party to manufacture. W e cannot predict whether the Trump administration will finalize the draft framework or if the government will propose other drug pricing policy changes. If pursued and finalized, these policies could reduce prices and reimbursement for certain of our products and could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations .\n\nThere is no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimates disclosed in this 2024 Form 10K or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance.\n\n## We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies and manufacturers and expect to see increasing market penetration of lower-priced generic products.\n\nThe future growth of BMS is dependent on the market access, uptake and expansion for marketed brands, new product introductions, new indications, product extensions and co-promotional activities with alliance partners. Competition is keen, and as we lose exclusivity for some of our marketed brands, lower-priced generic products will increasingly penetrate our markets. Generic or biosimilar challenges to our products can also arise at any time, and our patents may not prevent the emergence of generic or biosimilar competition for our products. In some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the U.S. or in the EU; political and social pressure has also pushed legislation and other measures that promote the use of generic and biosimilar products.  For additional information, see '-We could lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected.'\n\nIn addition, we face competition from new products entering the market. New products may have (i) lower prices, (ii) superior efficacy (benefit) or safety (risk) profiles (whether actual or perceived), (iii) technological advantages that may make such products more convenient to use, (iv) better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, (v) more effective marketing programs and/or other differentiating factors that make it harder for our products to compete. W e cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products that treat diseases and conditions like those treated by our products and product candidates. Business combinations among our competitors and major third-party payers may also increase competition for our products. If we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors' products in the marketplace, this could have a material negative impact on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## We could experience difficulties, delays and disruptions in our supply chain as well as in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.\n\nOur  product  supply  and  related  patient  access  has  been,  and  could  in  the  future  be,  negatively  impacted  by  difficulties,  delays  and  disruptions  in  the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products. Some of the difficulties, delays and disruptions include: (i) product seizures or recalls or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (ii) our failure, or the failure of any of our vendors or suppliers, to comply with cGMP and other applicable regulations or quality assurance  guidelines  that  could  lead  to  manufacturing  shutdowns,  product  shortages  or  delays  in  product  manufacturing;  (iii)  manufacturing,  quality assurance/quality control, supply problems or governmental approval delays; (iv) the failure of a supplier, including sole source or single source suppliers, to provide us with the necessary raw materials, supplies or finished goods within a reasonable timeframe and with required quality; (v) the failure of a third-party manufacturer to supply us with bulk active or finished product on time; (vi) construction or regulatory approval delays for new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for our biologics products; (vii) the failure to meet new and emerging regulations requiring products to be tracked throughout the distribution channels using unique identifiers to verify their authenticity in the supply chain; (viii) other manufacturing or distribution issues, including limits to manufacturing capacity and changes in the types of products produced, such as biologics, physical limitations, labor disputes  or  shortages,  or  other  business  interruptions;  (ix)  geopolitical  factors  in  a  specific  country  or  region,  including  any  new,  or  changes  in  or interpretations of existing, trade regulations, including for example, any new tariffs imposed in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or compliance requirements of  other  legislation; and (x) disruptions in supply chain continuity, including from market forces, natural disasters, global disease outbreaks or pandemics (including COVID-19), acts of war or terrorism or other unforeseeable or unavoidable events that materially impact one or more of our facilities or a critical supplier.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nfair v alue calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair v alues of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical v alues to the reporting unit carrying v alues. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value ov er carrying v alue (expressed as a percentage of carrying v alue for the respectiv e reporting unit) for each of the Company's reporting units ranged from approximately 55% to approximately 395%.\n\nThe Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenev er ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred for finite-liv ed intangibles requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future rev enues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets. Indefinite-liv ed intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred for indefinite-liv ed intangible assets inv olv es calculating the fair v alue of the indefinite-liv ed intangible assets and comparing the fair v alue to their carrying v alue. If the fair v alue is less than the carrying v alue, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.\n\nIf actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be ov erstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adv ersely affect the Company's financial statements.\n\nThe Company estimates the fair v alue of acquired trade names through the use of a relief from royalty method, which v alues an indefinite-liv ed intangible asset by estimating the royalties sav ed through the ownership of an asset. Under this method, an owner of an indefinite-liv ed intangible asset determines the arm's length royalty that likely would hav e been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party. The royalty rate, which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales, is tax-effected and discounted at present v alue using a discount rate commensurate with the relativ e risk of achiev ing the cash flow attributable to the asset. Management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions, including rev enue growth rates, perpetual rev enue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. As further described in Note 10 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded noncash impairment charges of $265 million pretax ($201 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to an indefinite-liv ed trade name within the genomics consumable business included in the Life Sciences segment and an indefinite-liv ed trade name in the Diagnostics segment, which are included in selling, general and administrativ e expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Following these impacts, if the fair v alues of the trade names declined by 10%, the Company estimates it would record additional impairment charges of $59 million.\n\nContingent Liabilities-As discussed in 'Item 3. Legal Proceedings' and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a v ariety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of prev iously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency or contract settlement expense that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation dev elopments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolv ed ov er long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to v arious factors, including those discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserv es established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserv es, which would adv ersely affect the Company's financial statements.\n\nIncome Taxes-For a description of the Company's income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the rev ersal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could hav e an adv erse impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nThe Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is 'more likely than not' that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in ev aluating tax positions and determining income tax prov isions. The Company re-ev aluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislativ e guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.",

      "question": "How do Abbott (ABT), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Thermo Fisher (TMO) each reflect the impact of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation in their 2023 financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their respective tax strategies and compensation structures?",

Eli Lilly also noted the inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as part of its tax provision, though specific figures were not disclosed. Thermo Fisher quantified these benefits at $69 million in 2023, showing a consistent downward trend from $124 million in 2021. These differences suggest varying levels of reliance on equity-based compensation and differing tax planning strategies around employee incentive programs across the three firms.",

The PPACA, health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. For example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 ('PAMA'), introduced a multi-year pricing program for services payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule ('CLFS') that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers. It is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services, but to the extent our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate, it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. Other countries, as well as some private payors, also control the price of health care products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or coverage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of governmental entities) through compulsory licensing. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.\n- Governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services. Payors are also seeking to improve price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increases.\n\nThese changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is delivered, reimbursed and funded and have in the past and could in the future cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\n## International economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors can negatively affect our business and financial statements.\n\nIn 2021 approximately 62% of our sales were derived from customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in the high-growth markets. Our non-U.S. business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that include:\n\n- public health crises and epidemics, such as COVID-19;\n- interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers;\n- differences in terms of sale, including longer payment terms than are typical in the U.S.;\n- local product preferences or requirements;\n- changes in a country's or region's political, legal, social or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;\n- trade protection measures, tariffs, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Inventories\n\nThe fair value step-up adjustment of $881 million, included in inventories of $946 million as of the acquisition date, was primarily determined by the estimated selling price of finished inventory less the cost to complete the manufacturing process and selling effort. The step-up adjustment is recorded in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Income as the inventory is sold to customers and in Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income for inventory used for clinical purposes.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nThe finite-lived intangible asset of $4.6 billion represents the estimated fair value of Trodelvy for metastatic triple-negative breast  cancer  ('TNBC')  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  The  fair  value  was  determined  by  applying  the  income  approach  using unobservable inputs to estimate probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to Trodelvy for metastatic TNBC and a discount rate of 7.0%. The discount rate used represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value this intangible asset. This intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated useful life of 12 years.\n\nAcquired  IPR&amp;D  assets  consist  of  Trodelvy  for  hormone  receptor  positive,  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2 negative,  metastatic  breast  cancer,  Trodelvy  for  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  Trodelvy  for  urothelial  cancer  ('UC').  The estimated aggregate fair value of $15.8 billion as of the acquisition date was determined by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs to estimate probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to these assets and a discount rate of 7.0%. The discount rate used represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value these intangible assets. Trodelvy for UC was granted accelerated approval by FDA in April 2021 and $1.0 billion was reclassified to finite-lived intangibles from IPR&amp;D. See Note 9. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information.\n\nSome of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of intangible asset fair values include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (including revenue, cost of sales, research and development costs, and sales and marketing expenses); probability of success; the discount rate selected to measure the inherent risk of future cash flows; the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, among other factors.\n\nWe also recorded an intangible asset related to a license and supply agreement with a third party, which was entered into by Immunomedics prior  to  the  acquisition.  Under  the  agreement,  the  third  party  was  granted  an  exclusive  license  to  develop  and commercialize Trodelvy in certain territories in Asia and make certain sales milestones and royalty payments to us. The acquisition date fair value of $175 million was determined by estimating the probability-weighted net cash flows attributable to the outlicense and  a  discount  rate  of  7.0%.  The  discount  rate  represents  the  estimated  rate  that  market  participants  would  use  to  value  this intangible asset. This intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated useful life of 15 years on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe  inputs  used  for  valuing  these  identifiable  intangibles  are  unobservable  and  considered  Level  3  under  the  fair  value measurement and disclosure guidance.",

In 2019, we and Innovent began co-commercializing Tyvyt in China. In 2020, we obtained an exclusive license for sintilimab injection from Innovent for geographies outside of China. Innovent, with collaboration from us, has filed the initial registration of sintilimab injection in the U.S., and we plan to pursue initial registration of sintilimab injection in other markets and all other subsequent registrations of sintilimab injection. We have exclusive commercialization rights outside of China.\n\nIn connection with a regulatory approval for Tyvyt in China in 2021, we capitalized a milestone payment of $40.0 million as an intangible asset which is being amortized to cost of sales through the term of the collaboration.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Innovent is eligible to receive up to $825.0 million for geographies outside of China and up to $195.0 million in China in success-based regulatory and sales-based milestones. Innovent is also eligible to receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales for geographies outside of China.\n\nWe record our sales of Tyvyt to third parties as net product revenue, with payments made to Innovent for its portion of the gross margin reported as cost of sales. We report as collaboration and other revenue our portion of the gross margin for Tyvyt sales made by Innovent to third parties.

In  addition,  the  agreement provides  for  contingent  payments  from  Merck  to  Eisai  related  to  the  successful  achievement  of  sales-based  and  regulatory milestones. Merck made sales-based milestone payments to Eisai aggregating $200 million, $500 million and $50 million in 2021, 2020  and  2019,  respectively.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  sales-based  milestone  payments  accrued  but  not  yet  paid  totaled $600 million. Potential future sales-based milestone payments of $2.6 billion have not yet been accrued as they are not deemed by the Company to be probable at this time.\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, Lenvima received regulatory approvals triggering capitalized milestone payments of $75 million and $10 million, respectively, from Merck to Eisai. As of December 31, 2021, a regulatory approval milestone payment of $25 million was accrued but not yet paid. Potential future regulatory milestone payments of $25 million remain under the agreement.\n\nThe  intangible  asset  balance  related  to  Lenvima  (which  includes  capitalized  sales-based  and  regulatory  milestone payments) was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021 and is included in Other Intangibles, Net .

      "question": "How do Amgen, CVS Health, and Danaher each approach the management and disclosure of long-term borrowings, and what does this reveal about their respective financial strategies and risk profiles in 2023?",
      "answer": "Amgen discloses a significant increase in long-term borrowings, rising from $37.4 billion in 2022 to $63.2 billion in 2023, largely driven by the acquisition of Horizon and subsequent debt issuance totaling $24.0 billion in March 2023. The company also utilizes interest rate and cross-currency swaps to manage exposure. CVS Health, while not disclosing a specific long-term borrowing figure, indicates a reliance on a mix of short-term and long-term borrowings to fund business growth, with a focus on maintaining liquidity through diverse revenue streams and short settlement cycles. Danaher, in contrast, emphasizes the fair value accounting of its long-term borrowings, noting that these are categorized as Level 1 and valued based on quoted market prices, with differences between fair value and carrying amounts attributed to changes in interest rates or credit ratings. This reveals Amgen's aggressive financing for strategic acquisitions, CVS\u2019s conservative working capital and liquidity management, and Danaher\u2019s focus on transparent fair value disclosures and sensitivity to market conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMGN \u2192 Long-Term Borrowings: Amgen reports long-term borrowings of $63.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, up from $37.4 billion in 2022, with $24.0 billion issued in March 2023 to fund the Horizon acquisition. The company uses interest rate and cross-currency swaps to manage risk.",
        "Hop 2: CVS \u2192 Long-Term Borrowings: CVS indicates it funds business growth through a mix of cash flow, commercial paper, and long-term borrowings, but does not disclose a specific figure. It emphasizes short settlement cycles and diverse funding sources, suggesting a more conservative and liquidity-focused approach.",
        "Hop 3: DHR \u2192 Long-Term Borrowings: Danaher reports that its long-term borrowings are categorized as Level 1 and valued based on quoted market prices. It notes that differences between fair value and carrying amounts are due to changes in interest rates or credit ratings, indicating a focus on market-sensitive financial reporting."

      "question": "How do Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Johnson & Johnson each report royalty income or related expenses in their 2024 financial disclosures, and what do these differences suggest about their reliance on or strategy toward external intellectual property licensing?",
      "answer": "Amgen reports royalty income as part of 'Other revenues,' where it is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends of licensed products. Bristol-Myers Squibb reports royalty expenses totaling $736 million in 2024, including $546 million for Keytruda and $47 million for Tecentriq, indicating significant royalty outflows tied to major drug licensing agreements. Johnson & Johnson includes royalty income within 'Other (Income) Expense, Net,' which captures gains and losses from various non-operational financial activities, including royalty income from external licensing arrangements. The differences suggest that Amgen monetizes its own IP through royalty inflows, BMY incurs substantial royalty costs tied to key oncology partnerships, and JNJ treats royalty income as a secondary, more incidental financial component within broader investment and licensing activities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues consist primarily of royalty income and corporate partner revenues. Royalties from licensees are based on third-party sales of licensed products and are recorded when the related third-party product sale occurs. Royalty income is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends. Corporate partner revenues are  composed  mainly  of  license  fees  and  milestones  earned  and  our  share  of  commercial  profits  generated  from  collaborations.  See Arrangements  with  multipleperformance obligations, discussed below.\n\n## Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into arrangements for the R&amp;D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and product candidates. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or goods, including intellectual property rights/licenses, R&amp;D services, manufacturing services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to Amgen in the form of nonrefundable, upfront license fees; development and commercial-performance milestone payments; royalty payments; and/or profit sharing.\n\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or by using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\n\nThe  consideration  allocated  to  each  distinct  performance  obligation  is  recognized  as  revenue  when  control  of  the  related  goods  or  services  is  transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will  not  occur.  We  utilize  the  sales-  and  usage-based  royalty  ex ception  in  arrangements  that  resulted  from  the  license  of  intellectual  property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nR&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical  manufacturing  costs;  contract  services  and  other  outside  costs;  information  systems'  costs;  and  amortization  of  acquired  technology  used  in  R&amp;D  with alternative future uses. R&amp;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with third-party R&amp;D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&amp;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSG&amp;A costs are primarily composed of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel;  facilities  and  overhead  costs;  outside  marketing,  advertising  and  legal  ex penses;  the  U.S.  healthcare  reform  federal  ex cise  fee  on  Branded  Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $987 million, $647 million and $841  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  SG &amp;A  ex penses  also  include  costs  and  cost  recoveries  associated  with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG &amp;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract,  we  determine  whether  an  arrangement  is  or  contains  a  lease.  For  all  leases,  we  determine  the  classification  as  either  operating  or financing. Operating leases are included in Other noncurrent assets, Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Lease recognition occurs at the commencement date, and lease liability amounts are based on the present value of lease payments made during the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Because most of our leases do not provide information to determine an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of",

      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott (ABT) used foreign currency forward contracts totaling $8.6 billion to hedge against exchange rate risks that could affect the cost of products sold. CVS Health (CVS) reported a cost of products sold of $37 million in its services segment, which represented a 100% increase from the previous year, signaling a growing expense. Medtronic (MDT) reported a $0.4 billion decrease in cost of products sold from $10.5 billion in 2021 to $10.1 billion in 2022, attributing this to pandemic-related cost increases in the prior year, while also noting future pressures from inflation and higher labor and material costs.

          "chunk_text": "In  June  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2016-13, Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses ,  which  changes  the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 - A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nUnder the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental,  technological  and  other  factors  that  may  affect  Abbott's  operations  are  discussed  in  Item  1A,  Risk Factors.\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Financial Instruments and Risk Management\n\n## Market Price Sensitive Investments\n\nThe fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $11 million and $20 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2021 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in  earnings.  The  fair  value  of  investments  in  mutual  funds  that  are  held  in  a  rabbi  trust  for  the  purpose  of  paying benefits  under  a  deferred  compensation  plan  was  approximately  $391  million  and  $366  million  as  of  December  31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these  investments,  as  well  as  an  offsetting  change  in  the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.\n\n## Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities\n\nAbbott  holds  equity  securities  that  are  not  traded  on  public  stock  exchanges.  The  carrying  value  of  these investments  was  $90  million  and  $113  million  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  No  individual investment  is  recorded  at  a  value  in  excess  of  $15  million.  Abbott  measures  these  investments  at  cost  minus impairment,  if  any,  plus  or  minus  changes  resulting  from  observable  price  changes  in  orderly  transactions  for  the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\n\n## Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nAt  December  31,  2021  and  2020, Abbott  had  interest  rate  hedge  contracts  totaling  $2.9  billion  to  manage  its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at  December 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $21.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.4% and 3.3% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values.\n\n## Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments\n\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  for  anticipated  intercompany  purchases  by  those  subsidiaries  whose  functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott held $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2021 will mature in 2022 or 2023 depending upon the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2020 matured in 2021 or will mature in 2022 depending upon the contract.",

          "chunk_text": "- Resolution of findings contained in a December 2021 U.S. FDA warning letter relating to the MiniMed 600 series insulin pump and a remote controller device for MiniMed 508 and Paradigm pumps. We are currently working with the U.S. FDA to resolve the findings. The existence of the warning letter may limit our ability to launch certain new Diabetes products in the U.S. prior to resolution of the findings.\n- Our ability  to  successfully  develop,  obtain  regulatory  approval  of  and  commercialize  the  products  within  our  pipeline,  which include, but are not limited to, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump and the Guardian 4 sensor, which have been submitted to the U.S. FDA.\n\n## COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\nThe following is a summary of cost of products sold, research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales:\n\nCost  of  Products  Sold We  continue  to  focus  on  reducing  our  costs  of  production  through  supplier  management,  manufacturing improvements, and optimizing our manufacturing network. Cost of products sold for fiscal year 2022 was $10.1 billion as compared to $10.5 billion for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was largely due to the conditions of the pandemic during fiscal year 2021, which resulted in recognizing a portion of our fixed overhead costs as period expenses, increases in our reserves in our excess and obsolete inventory, as well as negative impact from mix, as products in higher demand had lower gross margins. The decrease was also attributable to charges from field correction actions in the prior year. Fiscal year 2022 included $58 million of inventory  write-downs  associated  with  our  June  2021  decision  to  stop  the  distribution  and  sale  of  Medtronic's  HV AD  System  (MCS charges). Looking forward, our cost of products sold likely will be further negatively impacted by inflation and higher labor and direct material costs.\n\nResearch and Development Expense We remain committed to deliver the best possible experiences for every patient, physician, and caregiver we serve; to create technologies that expand what's possible across the entire human body to transform lives; to turn data and insights  into  real  action  to  serve  real  patient  needs,  dramatically  improving  care;  and  to  expand  healthcare  access  and  deliver  positive outcomes that go far beyond our products. Research and development expense for fiscal year 2022 was $2.7 billion as compared to $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2021. Fiscal year 2022 included $101 million of acquisitions of, and license payments for, technology not approved by regulators, primarily in our Diabetes segment.\n\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense Our goal is to continue to leverage selling, general, and administrative expense initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages, other administrative costs, such as professional fees and marketing expenses, and certain acquisition and restructuring expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expense for fiscal year 2022 was $10.3 billion as compared to $10.1 billion for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of  net  sales  was  primarily  driven  by  net  sales  growth  as  a  result  of  the  recovery  of  procedural  volumes  partially  offset  by increases in employee travel as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year when travel was limited.",

      "question": "How do Abbott (ABT), Danaher (DHR), and Medtronic (MDT) each compare in terms of their 2024 cash paid for operating lease liabilities, and what does this suggest about their relative investment in leased assets and operational footprint expansion?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Abbott reported cash paid for operating lease liabilities at $300 million, Danaher at $245 million, and Medtronic at $232 million. Abbott\u2019s figure reflects a steady increase from $274 million in 2022, suggesting a consistent investment in leased assets. Danaher\u2019s $245 million in 2024 represents a significant jump from $214 million in 2023, indicating a recent uptick in leasing activity. Medtronic\u2019s $232 million in 2024, up from $174 million in 2022, shows a growing trend in lease commitments, particularly with a notable $417 million in right-of-use assets added in 2023. Collectively, these figures suggest that while all three companies are investing in leased assets, Abbott maintains the highest level of cash outflow for leases, potentially signaling a more aggressive expansion of its operational footprint compared to Danaher and Medtronic.",

      "answer": "In 2020, AbbVie experienced a decrease in discount rates, contributing to a $1.1 billion actuarial loss for its qualified pension plans and a $40 million loss for other post-employment plans, highlighting significant sensitivity to discount rate movements. Danaher also reported that the 2020 decrease in discount rates was the largest contributor to net losses affecting its U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Eli Lilly's benefit obligation increased by $2.13 billion in 2020 due to the drop in discount rates, indicating a similarly high exposure. In 2021, as discount rates increased, AbbVie recorded an $8 million actuarial gain for qualified pension plans, while Danaher noted net actuarial gains driven by higher discount rates. Eli Lilly saw its benefit obligation decrease by $750.4 million in 2021 due to the rising discount rate, showing a reversal of the prior year\u2019s trend. Collectively, this reveals that all three companies have substantial pension liabilities sensitive to discount rate fluctuations, but the magnitude and timing of the impact varied based on their respective plan structures and assumptions.",

The 2020 actuarial losses of $1.1 billion for qualified pension plans and $40 million for other post-employment plans were primarily driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate from 2019.\n\nAbbVie's U.S. pension plan was modified to close the plan to new entrants effective January 1, 2022. In addition, a change to AbbVie's U.S. retiree health benefit plan was approved in 2020 and communicated to employees and retirees in October 2020. Beginning in 2022, Medicare-eligible retirees and Medicare-eligible dependents will choose health care coverage from insurance providers through a private Medicare exchange. AbbVie will continue to provide financial support to Medicare-eligible retirees. This change to the U.S. retiree health benefit plan decreased AbbVie's post-employment benefit obligation and increased AbbVie's unrecognized prior service credit as of December 31, 2020 by $397 million.\n\nIn connection with the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie assumed certain post-employment benefit obligations which were recorded at fair value.

ABT explicitly discloses a consistent 8% assumed health care cost trend rate for 2024, gradually declining to 5% by 2031, indicating a structured long-term decline path for cost assumptions. MRK provides context that its health care cost trend rate assumptions are aligned with long-term portfolio performance expectations, with an expected return on U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of 7.70% in 2025, slightly down from 7.75% in 2024.

          "chunk_text": "\nThe expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2024 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2025. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2025 by $109 million.\n\nThe health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2024 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2025.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional i nformation. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a l ower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.\n\n## Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. In-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an\n\n## 47 | 2024 Form 10-K",

The expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid and is determined on a plan basis. The expected rate of return for each plan is developed considering long-term historical returns data, current market conditions, and actual returns on the plan assets. Using this reference information, the long-term return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected return for each plan's target portfolio is developed according to the allocation among those investment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate.

      "answer": "CVS utilizes long-term borrowings as part of a diversified funding strategy that includes cash flow from operations and short-term instruments, supporting its dual pharmacy and health care benefits business model. The company emphasizes flexibility in working capital, particularly due to the timing of CMS settlements in its Medicare Part D services, which affects cash flow predictability. Eli Lilly relies on long-term borrowings to fund a broad array of capital requirements, including R&D, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and milestone payments. The company explicitly notes its ability to access both short- and long-term debt markets as critical to financing its $1 billion+ investments in new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Ireland, as well as a $747.4 million acquisition in 2021. Thermo Fisher discloses that its long-term borrowings include both fixed and variable rate instruments, with interest rates incorporating stated interest, discount accretion, and debt issuance cost amortization. It also notes fair value considerations for its long-term debt, which implies a more structured and market-sensitive approach to debt financing. Together, these perspectives reveal that CVS uses debt for operational flexibility, Lilly for strategic growth and R&D funding, and Thermo Fisher for precision in capital structuring and fair value alignment.",

('Cardinal') each have a 50% ownership in Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ('Red Oak'), a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak. Red Oak does not own or hold inventory on behalf of either company.\n\n## Working Capital Practices\n\nThe Company funds the growth of its businesses through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and long-term borrowings. For additional information on the Company's working capital practices, see 'Liquidity and Capital Resources' in the MD&amp;A included in Item 7 of this 10-K. Employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, providers, governmental units, government-sponsored plans (with the exception of Medicare Part D services, which are described below), labor groups and expatriates, which represent the vast majority of Health Care Benefits segment revenues, typically settle in less than 30 days. As a provider of Medicare Part D services, the Company contracts annually with CMS. Utilization of services each plan year results in the accumulation of either a receivable from or a payable to CMS. The timing of settlement of the receivable or payable with CMS takes several quarters, which impacts working capital from year to year. The majority of the Retail/LTC segment non-pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards. Managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, government funded health care programs, commercial employers and other third party insurance programs, which represent the vast majority of the Company's consolidated pharmacy revenues, typically settle in less than 30 days. The remainder of the Company's consolidated pharmacy revenues are paid in cash, or with debit or credit cards.\n\n## Human Capital\n\n## Overview\n\nAt CVS Health, we share a single, clear purpose: bringing our heart to every moment of your health. We devote significant time and attention to the attraction, development and retention of talent to deliver high levels of service to our customers. Our commitment to them includes a competitive rewards package and programs that support our diverse range of colleagues in rewarding and fulfilling careers. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 300,000 colleagues primarily in the United States including in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, approximately 72% of whom were full-time.\n\nWe believe engaged colleagues produce stronger business results and are more likely to build a career with the Company. Each year we conduct an internal engagement survey that provides colleagues with an opportunity to share their opinions and experiences with respect to their role, their team and the enterprise to help our Board and our management identify areas where we can improve colleague experience. The survey covers a broad range of topics including development and opportunities, diversity management, recognition, performance, well-being, compliance and continuous improvement. In 2021, greater than 80% of our colleagues participated in the engagement survey, of which greater than 75% responded that they were actively engaged.\n\nThe Board and our chief executive officer ('CEO') provide oversight of our human capital strategy, which consists of the following categories: total rewards; diversity, equity and inclusion; colleague development; and health and safety.\n\n## Total Rewards\n\nWe recognize how vital our colleagues are to our success and strive to offer comprehensive and competitive wages and benefits to meet the varying needs of our colleagues and their families. The benefits and programs include annual bonuses, 401(k) plans, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, health care and insurance benefits, paid time off, flexible work schedules, family leave, dependent care resources, colleague assistance programs and tuition assistance, among many others, depending on eligibility.\n\nIn recognition of the critical role that the attraction and retention of talent plays in the success of our business, during 2021, we also announced a significant investment in our employees through an increase in the Company's minimum hourly wage to $15.00 an hour effective July 2022, with incremental increases to the Company's competitive hourly rates beginning in August 2021. The new wage structure also incorporates additional increases beyond the $15.00 minimum, with higher starting hourly rates for roles such as pharmacy technicians and call center representatives. In addition, during 2021 we awarded incremental",

As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital equipment expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act, leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see Notes 11, 4, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act contains a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations, if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress, we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period. See \"Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters -Tax Matters\" for additional information.\n\nWe plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices. We plan to invest more than 400 million euros over several years in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.82 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $3.66 billion at December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.26 billion in 2021, compared with $6.50 billion in 2020. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.30 billion and $2.99 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable CVR per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions.

      "answer": "BMY assumes a consistent 1.4% Rate of Compensation Increase in both 2024 and 2023, signaling conservative expectations for future employee cost growth. LLY uses a 4.3% Rate of Compensation Increase in 2024, up slightly from 4.0% in 2023, suggesting a more aggressive assumption about future salary growth. MDT projects a 3.90% Rate of Compensation Increase for U.S. pension benefits in 2024, down from 4.83% in 2022, indicating a moderating outlook on compensation growth over time.",

        "Hop 3: MDT \u2192 Rate of Compensation Increase: MDT reports a 3.90% rate for 2024, down from 4.83% in 2022, showing a declining trend in assumed compensation growth."

Johnson & Johnson reports acquiring $0.6 billion in IPR&D assets as part of its broader acquisition strategy, indicating a strategic approach to acquiring early-stage innovation. Pfizer, in contrast, reported a $1,873 million impairment specifically tied to its IPR&D portfolio, signaling higher risk and uncertainty in its early-stage development projects.

These figures highlight significant differences in their M&A intensity and strategic focus during the post-pandemic recovery. DHR's high acquisition spending suggests aggressive expansion, likely to diversify and grow its healthcare technology portfolio. LLY's relatively modest outflow indicates a more measured, targeted approach to inorganic growth, possibly focused on therapeutic innovation.

Danaher emphasizes its R&D as a key driver for product innovation and competitive positioning, with global R&D operations and collaborations with external institutions, signaling a broad and externally integrated innovation strategy. Pfizer highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of its R&D, noting the uncertainty of clinical outcomes and regulatory approvals, which reflects a more speculative and pipeline-driven model. Together, these perspectives reveal a spectrum of R&D strategies\u2014from Amgen\u2019s phased discipline, to Danaher\u2019s collaborative innovation, to Pfizer\u2019s high-risk therapeutic pipeline focus.",

          "chunk_text": "- performance goals aligned to our strategic priorities. Annual reviews under the program assess performance against these formal, annual objectives and against our leadership anchors.\n- Talent Development and Career Mobility. Our talent development program (which is generally structured to consist of 70% on-the-job learning, 20% coaching and mentoring and 10% formal training) strives to provide every associate with appropriate development opportunities. In particular, we make available to people leaders at every level training, coaching and developmental resources to help them be effective leaders and advance their careers. We further encourage internal promotion and mobility through our Danaher Go program, which makes open positions throughout the organization visible to associates and proactively encourages our associates to seek promotional opportunities. We assess our performance in this area using metrics including internal fill rate (which tracks the percentages of open roles at particular levels filled by our own associates) as well as the percentage of eligible associates with completed talent assessments/career plans.\n- Safety and Risk Management. Associate safety is deeply embedded in our culture. Our Environment, Health and Safety ('EHS') Policy establishes the core principles upon which our EHS management programs are built, and associates use our DBS-based '4E' toolkit to identify, assess and control hazards related to ergonomics, energetics, exposures and environment. In addition, we evaluate and manage risks relating to our human capital strategy as part of Danaher's enterprise risk management program. Key quantitative measures that we use to assess performance in this category include total recordable incident rate (defined as the number of work-related injuries or illness cases serious enough to require treatment beyond first aid, per 100 associates) and days away, restricted or transferred (defined as the number of work-related injuries or illness cases that result in an employee working with physical restrictions, being away from work or unable to do their job or transferring to other work, per 100 associates).\n\nThe health and well-being of our associates has been a key area of focus in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We launched a global Employee Assistance Program in March 2020 to ensure a consistent support structure for mental health and well-being across the Company and have since expanded the program to provide enhanced support with respect to childcare, eldercare and tutoring, among other areas. In the United States, we have provided benefits beyond the requirements of the Families First Act, for example by extending our leave policy to cover elder care and providing for voluntary leaves even in certain circumstances not required by the law. We have also implemented safety precautions on a facility-specific basis. The results of our 2021 Associate Engagement Survey questions relating to the pandemic validate the impact of these efforts: 87% of surveyed associates believe that associate well-being and safety is Danaher's priority, and 90% of surveyed associates feel supported by their direct supervisor in adapting to changes due to the pandemic.\n\n## Research and Development ('R&amp;D')\n\nThe Company conducts R&amp;D activities for the purpose of developing new products, enhancing the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of its existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of its products are appropriate. The Company's R&amp;D efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology, and we work with a number of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. The Company conducts R&amp;D activities primarily in North America, Europe and Asia and generally on a business-by-business basis. The Company anticipates that it will continue to make significant expenditures for R&amp;D as it seeks to provide a continuing flow of innovative products and services to maintain and improve its competitive position. For a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Government Contracts\n\nAlthough the substantial majority of the Company's revenue in 2021 was from customers other than governmental entities, each of Danaher's segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities. As a result, the Company is subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments. For a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.' No material portion of Danaher's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government entity.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nThe Company faces extensive government regulation both within and outside the United States relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of its products and services. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that the Company is subject to. These are not the only regulations that the Company's businesses must comply",

We also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public, as well as public oral statements. Given their forward-looking nature, these statements involve substantial risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions.\n\nWe have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as 'will,' 'may,' 'could,' 'likely,' 'ongoing,' 'anticipate,' 'estimate,' 'expect,' 'project,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'believe,' 'assume,' 'target,' 'forecast,' 'guidance,' 'goal,' 'objective,' 'aim,' 'seek,' 'potential' and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates.\n\nWe include forward-looking information in our discussion of the following, among other topics:\n\n- our anticipated operating and financial performance, reorganizations, business plans, strategy and prospects;\n- expectations for our product pipeline, in-line products and product candidates, including anticipated regulatory submissions, data read-outs, study starts, approvals, clinical trial results and other developing data, revenue contribution, growth, performance, timing of exclusivity and potential benefits;\n- strategic reviews, capital allocation objectives, dividends and share repurchases;\n- plans for and prospects of our acquisitions, dispositions and other business development activities, and our ability to successfully capitalize on these opportunities;\n- sales, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings;\n- expectations for impact of or changes to existing or new government regulations or laws;\n- our ability to anticipate and respond to macroeconomic, geopolitical, health and industry trends, pandemics, acts of war and other large-scale crises; and\n- manufacturing and product supply.\n\nIn particular, forward-looking information in this Form 10-K includes statements relating to specific future actions and effects, including, among others, our efforts to respond to COVID-19, including our development of a vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 and an oral COVID-19 treatment, the forecasted revenue contribution of Comirnaty and the potential number of doses that we and BioNTech believe can be manufactured and/or delivered; the forecasted revenue contribution of Paxlovid and the potential number of treatment courses that we believe can be manufactured; our expectations regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business; the expected patent term for Comirnaty and Paxlovid; the expectations for ongoing revenue streams from Comirnaty and Paxlovid; the expected impact of patent expiries and competition from generic manufacturers; the expected pricing pressures on our products and the anticipated impact to our business; the availability of raw materials for 2022; the expected charges and/or costs in connection with the spin-off of the Upjohn Business and its combination with Mylan; the benefits expected from our business development transactions; our anticipated liquidity position; the anticipated costs and savings from certain of our initiatives, including our Transforming to a More Focused Company program; our planned capital spending; and the expected benefit payments and employer contributions for our benefit plans.\n\nGiven their nature, we cannot assure that any outcome expressed in these forward-looking statements will be realized in whole or in part. Actual outcomes may vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated, implied or projected. These forward-looking statements may be affected by underlying assumptions that may prove inaccurate or incomplete, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those described in this section and in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section in this Form 10-K.\n\nTherefore, you are cautioned not to unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities law. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects.\n\nSome of the factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified below, as well as those discussed in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section in this Form 10-K and within MD&amp;A. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The occurrence of any of the risks identified below or in the Item 1A.

      "question": "How do JNJ, LLY, and MRK each account for upfront payments in their financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to recognizing revenue and expenses from collaborative agreements?",
      "answer": "JNJ explicitly categorizes upfront payments and milestones paid to collaborative partners (pre-regulatory approval) as Research and Development (R&D) expenses, indicating a clear policy of expensing such payments during the development phase. LLY recognizes upfront payments as part of revenue from collaborations and other arrangements, suggesting a focus on recognizing such inflows as earned under collaboration agreements. MRK, in contrast, expensed a $4.0 billion upfront payment related to a collaboration in 2023 as part of R&D expenses, aligning with JNJ\u2019s treatment of upfront payments as development costs rather than deferrable assets. This comparative view shows that while JNJ and MRK treat upfront payments as immediate R&D costs, LLY focuses on the revenue side, indicating differing financial strategies in managing collaborative partnerships.",

      "answer": "AbbVie recognizes chargebacks as part of variable consideration in revenue recognition, estimating them based on current pricing, contracts, and historical data. Gilead emphasizes a complex estimation process involving significant management judgment due to time lags between sales and claim settlements, using factors like product mix, payer mix, and channel inventory data. Pfizer provides concrete figures, reporting $12,698 million in chargebacks for 2024, reflecting a growing liability compared to prior years. Together, these approaches show that while all three companies face similar regulatory and contractual obligations, they differ in transparency and methodological rigor, with Pfizer offering the most quantitatively explicit disclosure.",

Certain products (i ncluding aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on reimbursement terms.\n\nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.\n\nAbbVie completed its previously announced acquisitions of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen) on February 12, 2024 and Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel Therapeutics) on August 1, 2024. See Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\n\n## Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling i nterest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, i nvoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less.\n\nCash discounts, rebates and chargebacks, sales incentives, product returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by",

Commitments  and Contingencies).\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nSee Note 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our significant accounting policies and how estimates are involved in the preparation of our financial statements. We believe the following reflect the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Rebates and Chargebacks\n\nRebates and chargebacks are determined using a complex estimation process which requires significant judgment by management in part due to the lag between the date of the product sales and the date the related rebates or chargeback claims are settled. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements and include amounts due to payers and healthcare providers under various programs.  These amounts may vary by product, payer and individual plans. Rebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, and expected payer mix and discount rates, which require significant estimates and judgment. In developing our estimates of rebates and chargebacks, we consider the following:\n\n- product sales, including product mix and pricing;\n- historical and estimated payer mix;\n- statutory discount requirements and contractual terms;\n- historical claims ex perience and processing time lags;\n- estimated patient population;\n- known market events or trends;\n- market research;\n- channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers; and\n- other pertinent internal or ex ternal information.\n\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our rebates and chargebacks accounts, including adjustments made relating to previous years' sales as a result of changes in estimates:\n\n",

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nAbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. (1)\n\nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.\n\n## Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. As COVID-19 continues to have an impact worldwide, AbbVie is focused on the health and safety of its employees, health care professionals and patients and communities. In the continued operation of its business, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from relevant health authorities, managed manufacturing and supply chain resources and monitored closely its clinical trial sites. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\"\n\n## Segments\n\nAbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. See Note 16, \"Segment and Geographic Area Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products and geographies included under Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n(1) As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the terms \"AbbVie\" or \"the company\" refer to AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation, or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\n\n## PART I",

Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information\n\n## A. Segment Information\n\nWe regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the completion of the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. Biopharma is a science-based medicines business that includes six therapeutic areas - Oncology, Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Rare Disease, Hospital, Vaccines and Internal Medicine. The Hospital therapeutic area commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines.\n\nEach operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&amp;D services from GPD and WRDM. These services include IPR&amp;D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. We have revised prior-period information (Revenues and Earnings, as defined by management) to conform to the current management structure.\n\n## Other Costs and Business Activities\n\nCertain pre-tax costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the following:\n\n- WRDM--the R&amp;D and Medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our Biopharma portfolio until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&amp;D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRDM organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to the various R&amp;D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders--including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities--with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizer's medicines.\n- GPD--the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including late-stage portfolio spend. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&amp;D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies.\n- Corporate and Other Unallocated--the costs associated with (i) corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement, among others), all strategy, business development, portfolio management and valuation capabilities, patient advocacy activities and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments; (ii) overhead expenses primarily associated with our manufacturing (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs; and (iii) our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV.\n- Certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and PP&amp;E; (ii) acquisition-related items, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the acquired operations and restructuring the combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items (such as pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses, gains on the completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or net gains and losses on investments in equity securities) that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Such items can include, but are not limited to, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset impairments and disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.\n\nThe operating results of PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization, and through July 31, 2019 our former Consumer Healthcare business are included in Other business activities.\n\n## Segment Assets\n\nWe manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $181 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $154 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n101",

PFE provides key metrics such as an expected rate of return of 8.0% and an actual return of 10.4% in 2023, along with a consistent 5.4% discount rate for measuring obligations.

Danaher estimates product returns and allowances based on historical experience and known trends, reducing revenue at the time of sale. Johnson & Johnson records sales returns allowances at full sales value, estimating returns based on historical sales and return patterns, and maintains a reserve of approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales for returns. While all three companies recognize returns as a reduction in revenue, AbbVie emphasizes contractual and legislative factors, Danaher focuses on historical and trend-based modeling, and Johnson & Johnson provides a quantified reserve figure with segment-specific resale considerations.

          "chunk_text": "## AbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1 Background\n\n## Background\n\nThe principal business of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (i ncluding aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on reimbursement terms.\n\nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.\n\nAbbVie completed its previously announced acquisitions of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen) on February 12, 2024 and Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel Therapeutics) on August 1, 2024. See Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information regarding these acquisitions.\n\n## Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling i nterest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, i nvoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less.\n\nCash discounts, rebates and chargebacks, sales incentives, product returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by",

Additionally, the Company is a limited partner in partnerships that inv est in start-up companies. While the partnerships record these inv estments at fair v alue, the Company's inv estment in the partnerships is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company made minority inv estments in equity method inv estments and non-marketable equity securities totaling $331 million, $172 million and $523 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely, including inv estments in partnerships of $174 million, $71 million and $283 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely. The Company recorded net realized and unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair v alue of these inv estments, as well as impairments to equity-method inv estments in other income (expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Refer to Notes 8 and 11 for additional information about the Company's inv estments.\n\nOther Assets-Other assets principally include operating lease right-of-use ('ROU') assets, noncurrent deferred tax assets and other inv estments.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments-The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equiv alents, trade accounts receiv able, inv estments in equity securities, av ailable-for-sale debt securities and cross-currency swaps, obligations under trade accounts payable and short and long-term debt. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying v alues for cash and cash equiv alents, trade accounts receiv able and trade accounts payable approximate fair v alue. Refer to Note 11 for the fair v alues of the Company's inv estments in equity securities, av ailable-for-sale debt securities and crosscurrency swaps and other obligations.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets-Goodwill and other intangible assets result from the Company's acquisition of existing businesses. In accordance with accounting standards related to business combinations, goodwill is not amortized; howev er, certain finite-liv ed identifiable intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and acquired technology, are amortized ov er their estimated useful liv es. Intangible assets with indefinite liv es are not amortized. In-process research and dev elopment ('IPR&amp;D') is initially capitalized at fair v alue and when the IPR&amp;D project is complete, the asset is considered a finite-liv ed intangible asset and amortized ov er its estimated useful life. If an IPR&amp;D project is abandoned, an impairment loss equal to the value of the intangible asset is recorded in the period of abandonment. The Company rev iews identified intangible assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recov erable. The Company also tests intangible assets with indefinite liv es and goodwill for impairment at least annually. Refer to Notes 2 and 10 for additional information about the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\nRevenue Recognition-The Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of life sciences research, biopharmaceutical drug production and medical diagnostic products and serv ices. Rev enue is recognized when control of the promised products or serv ices is transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or serv ices (the transaction price). A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or serv ice to a customer and is the unit of account under Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC') 606, Revenue from Contracts w ith Customers . The Company recognizes rev enue when the obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied; generally, this occurs when the customer obtains control of the underlying product or serv ice. For equipment and consumables sold by the Company, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. To indicate the transfer of control, the Company must hav e a present right to payment, legal title must hav e passed to the customer, the customer must hav e the significant risks and rewards of ownership, and where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must hav e accepted the product or serv ice. Returns for products sold are estimated and recorded as a reduction of rev enue at the time of sale. Customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of v olume discounts and other short-term incentiv e programs, are recorded as a reduction of rev enue at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the transaction price. Product returns, customer allowances and rebates are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. For extended warranty and serv ice, control transfers to the customer ov er the term of the arrangement and rev enue is recognized based upon the period of time elapsed under the arrangement. Rev enue for other long-term contracts is generally recognized based upon the cost-to-cost measure of progress, prov ided that the Company meets the criteria associated with transferring control of the good or serv ice ov er time.\n\nCertain of the Company's rev enues relate to operating-type lease ('OTL') arrangements. Leases are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases . Equipment lease rev enue for OTL agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the life of the lease, and the cost of customer-leased equipment is recorded within property, plant and equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated ov er the equipment's estimated useful life. Depreciation expense associated with the leased equipment under OTL arrangements is reflected in cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The OTLs are generally not cancellable until after an initial term and may or may not require the customer to purchase a minimum number of consumables or tests throughout the contract term. The Company also enters into sales-type lease ('STL') arrangements with customers which result in earlier recognition of equipment lease rev enue as compared to an OTL.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other information\n\n## Critical accounting policies and estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GA A P). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. A ctual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company's operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\n\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\n\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates and discounts are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\n\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that have lost patent exclusivity, or that otherwise exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\n\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. In accordance with the Company's accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GA A P guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales v alue. Sales returns in the Innovativ e M edicine segment are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the M edTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and include volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total rev enues in fiscal y ear 2024 and 2023, respectively, and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in the fiscal year 2022 and are included in sales to customers.\n\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. A mounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.\n\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n37",

      "question": "How do Abbott (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and Pfizer (PFE) each estimate and manage the financial impact of cash discounts on their gross sales, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to revenue recognition and customer payment terms in the healthcare sector?",
      "answer": "Abbott (ABT) reports that cash discounts in 2023, 2022, and 2021 were approximately $263 million, $280 million, and $268 million respectively, and notes that these discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, allowing for reliable estimation. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) indicates that cash discounts and chargebacks are reflected as a reduction to receivables and are typically settled within one month through customer credits. Pfizer (PFE) includes cash discounts as part of its broader sales allowances and accruals, estimating them based on historical experience and customer behavior. These differences in approach reflect ABT\u2019s short-cycle estimation reliability, BMY\u2019s structured receivables adjustment, and PFE\u2019s experience-based accrual methodology, highlighting varied strategies in managing cash discount liabilities and recognizing net revenues.",

        "Hop 1: ABT \u2192 Cash Discounts: ABT discloses specific dollar amounts for cash discounts across three years and notes the short window (15\u201330 days) for reliable estimation.",
        "Hop 2: BMY \u2192 Cash Discounts: BMY explains that cash discounts are treated as a reduction to receivables and settled within one month via customer credits, indicating a structured and short-term liability management process.",
        "Hop 3: PFE \u2192 Cash Discounts: PFE includes cash discounts within broader sales allowances and estimates them based on historical experience and customer behavior, showing a more generalized accrual approach."

      "answer": "AMGN categorizes its R&D activities into three distinct buckets: research and early pipeline, later-stage clinical programs, and marketed products, indicating a structured investment model aligned with product lifecycle stages. BMY highlights the financial risks tied to integrating R&D functions post-acquisition, particularly from the Celgene and MyoKardia deals, noting potential cost overruns, delays, and the impact of increased debt on innovation capacity. LLY discloses obligations to perform R&D activities as part of performance-based contracts, signaling a partnership-driven innovation model with future performance-linked R&D spending. Together, these disclosures reveal AMGN\u2019s internally focused lifecycle-driven R&D strategy, BMY\u2019s acquisition-dependent but risk-laden innovation path, and LLY\u2019s collaborative, obligation-tied R&D commitments.",

Pretax income generated from royalties was approximately $1.9 billion in 2021. Our pretax income could be adversely affected if the royalty streams decline in future periods.\n\nFailure  to  effectively  manage  acquisitions,  divestitures,  alliances,  joint  ventures  and  other  portfolio  actions  could adversely  impact  our  future  results.  In  addition,  any  businesses  or  assets  that  we  acquire  in  the  future  may underperform, we may not be able to successfully integrate them into our existing business and the occurrence of a number of unexpected factors could prevent or substantially delay the consummation of an anticipated acquisition, divestiture or merger.\n\nWe have acquired, or in-licensed, a number of assets and we expect to continue to support our pipeline with compounds or products obtained through licensing and acquisitions. Future revenues, profits and cash flows of an acquired company's products, technologies and pipeline candidates may not materialize due to low product uptake, delayed or missed pipeline opportunities,  the  inability  to  capture  expected  synergies  resulting  from  cost  savings  and  avoidance,  increased competition, safety concerns, regulatory issues, supply chain problems or other factors beyond our control. Substantial difficulties,  costs  and  delays  could  result  from  integrating  our  acquisitions,  including  for  (i)  R&amp;D,  manufacturing, distribution,  sales,  marketing,  promotion  and  information  technology  activities;  (ii)  policies,  procedures,  processes, controls and compliance; and (iii) tax considerations. Where we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities, such as in connection with a joint venture or acquisition, the value of those  securities  will  fluctuate  and  may  depreciate  in  value.  We  may  not  control  the  company  in  which  we  acquire securities,  such  as  in  connection  with  a  collaborative  arrangement,  and  as  a  result,  we  will  have  limited  ability  to determine its management, operational decisions, internal controls and compliance and other policies, which can result in additional financial and reputational risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets, and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. Our divestitures also may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, continued supply and services arrangements, or potential litigation, following the transaction. Under these arrangements, nonperformance by us could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition or reputation. In particular, we divested Otezla* in connection with obtaining regulatory approval for our acquisition of Celgene. If the FTC determines that we violated the consent order that we agreed to in connection with the divestiture, the FTC may seek a civil penalty and our reputation may be adversely affected.\n\nWe might also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our earnings. The value allocated to certain of our assets could be substantially impaired due to a number of factors beyond our control. New or revised accounting standards, rules and interpretations could result in changes to the recognition of income and expense that may materially and adversely affect our financial results.\n\nIf the execution or implementation of acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful, it could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Moreover, due to the substantial amount of debt that we incurred to finance the cash portion of the Celgene and MyoKardia acquisitions, there can be no assurance of when we will be able to expand our business development capacity. Although we are committed to reducing our debt, pursuing strategic transaction opportunities in future may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, and could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings.\n\n## Failure  to  attract  and  retain  highly  qualified  workforce  could  affect  our  ability  to  successfully  develop  and commercialize products.\n\nOur success is largely dependent on our continued ability to (i) attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management workforce, including people with expertise in clinical R&amp;D, governmental regulation and commercialization, and  (ii)  in  connection  with  our  Celgene  acquisition,  integrate  two  unique  corporate  cultures  and  maintain  employee morale. We are facing increasing competition for a limited pool of qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and  biotechnology  companies,  universities,  government  entities,  research  institutions,  companies  seeking  to  enter  the healthcare space, and companies in other industries. We cannot be sure that we will be able to retain quality talent or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.\n\n## Market, Liquidity and Credit Risks\n\nOur significant additional indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the Celgene and MyoKardia acquisitions could have negative consequences.\n\nOur acquisitions of Celgene and MyoKardia increased the amount of our debt resulting in additional interest expense. This  could  reduce  our  financial  flexibility  to  continue  capital  investments,  develop  new  products  and  declare  future dividends.",

These figures suggest that Pfizer is engaging in significantly larger acquisition activities compared to Amgen and Johnson & Johnson, potentially signaling a more aggressive expansion strategy.

AMGN increases its deferred financing costs by $264 million in connection with the issuance of new notes, which are being accreted over the term of the debt, showing a strategic use of debt modifications to manage interest expenses. CVS actively writes off unamortized deferred financing costs during early debt extinguishments, with specific write-offs of $8 million, $26 million, $45 million, and $47 million in different redemption periods, reflecting a more dynamic and transactional approach to debt restructuring.

The senior notes purchased included the following: $1.3 billion of its 3.125% senior notes due 2020, $723 million of its floating rate notes due 2020, $328 million of its 4.125% senior notes due 2021, $297 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 issued by Aetna, $413 million of 5.45% senior notes due 2021 issued by Coventry Health Care, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aetna, and $962 million of its 3.35% senior notes due 2021. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company paid a premium of $76 million in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were purchased, incurred $8 million in fees and recognized a net gain of $5 million on the write-off of net unamortized deferred financing premiums, for a net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $79 million.\n\nSee Note 8 ''Borrowings and Credit Agreements'' and Note 12 ''Shareholders' Equity'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about debt issuances, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company's use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps.\n\n## Debt Covenants\n\nThe Company's back-up revolving credit facilities, unsecured senior notes and unsecured floating rate notes (see Note 8 ''Borrowings and Credit Agreements'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. These covenants do not include an acceleration of the Company's debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in the Company's credit ratings. The Company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect its financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.\n\n## Debt Ratings\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's long-term debt was rated 'Baa2' by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ('Moody's') and 'BBB' by Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services LLC ('S&amp;P'), and its commercial paper program was rated 'P-2' by Moody's and 'A-2' by S&amp;P. The outlook on the Company's long-term debt is 'Stable' by Moody's and 'Positive' by S&amp;P. In assessing the Company's credit strength, the Company believes that both Moody's and S&amp;P considered, among other things, the Company's capital structure and financial policies as well as its consolidated balance sheet, its historical acquisition activity",

      "question": "How do AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Johnson & Johnson differ in their accounting treatment of milestone payments tied to collaboration agreements, and what does this reveal about their respective financial strategies in managing partnership risks and rewards?",
      "answer": "AbbVie highlights that its collaboration with Janssen includes potential future development, regulatory, and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million, which are tied to the Imbruvica collaboration and influence profit and cost-sharing dynamics. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) outlines a comprehensive framework for handling milestone payments, including deferring and amortizing upfront and contingent development and regulatory approval milestones over the expected period of its development and co-promotion obligation. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) states that milestone payments made to third parties in connection with R&D collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval, and capitalized and amortized thereafter. These differences reveal that AbbVie focuses on milestone-linked profit sharing, BMY emphasizes long-term amortization aligned with strategic obligations, and JNJ differentiates treatment based on regulatory milestones, reflecting a phased financial risk management approach.",

      "answer": "BMY actively hedges its foreign currency exposure using forward contracts and a 'zero-cost collar' strategy, with a notional amount of $3.5 billion in euros and $1.2 billion in Japanese yen as of December 31, 2021. DHR primarily translates its foreign currency exposure through balance sheet adjustments and uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to hedge net investments, indicating a more passive approach. MDT employs a dual strategy using both freestanding derivatives ($4.9 billion at April 29, 2022) and cash flow hedges ($8.8 billion at the same date), with a significant portion of Euro-denominated debt ($17.0 billion) designated as a net investment hedge. These approaches reflect BMY's tactical hedging, DHR's structural translation-based risk management, and MDT's comprehensive and layered hedging strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BMY \u2192 Foreign Currency Transactions: BMY uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany transactions and employs a 'zero-cost collar' strategy involving put and call options.

(a)\n\nA termination fee related to our Europe and Asia partnership with Sanofi of $80 million was included in 2019. (b)\n\n## Qualifying Hedges and Non-Qualifying Derivatives\n\nCash Flow Hedges Foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge certain forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and  sales  transactions  and  certain  foreign  currency  transactions.  The  fair  value  for  contracts  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  is temporarily reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. The net gain or loss on foreign currency forward contracts is expected to be reclassified to net earnings (primarily included in Cost of products sold and Other (income)/expense, net) within the next 12 months. The notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was primarily attributed to the euro of $3.5 billion and Japanese yen of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021.\n\nThe  earnings  impact  related  to  discontinued  cash  flow  hedges  and  hedge  ineffectiveness  was  not  material  during  all  periods presented. Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring within 60 days after the originally forecasted date or when the hedge is no longer effective. Assessments to determine whether derivatives designated  as  qualifying  hedges  are  highly  effective  in  offsetting  changes  in  the  cash  flows  of  hedged  items  are  performed  at inception and on a quarterly basis. Foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to offset exposures in certain foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings as they occur.\n\nBMS may hedge a portion of its  future  foreign  currency  exposure  by  utilizing  a  strategy  that  involves  both  a  purchased  local currency put option and a written local currency call option that are accounted for as hedges of future sales denominated in that local currency. Specifically, BMS sells (or writes) a local currency call option and purchases a local currency put option with the same expiration dates and local currency notional amounts but with different strike prices. The premium collected from the sale of the call option is equal to the premium paid for the purchased put option, resulting in no net premium being paid. This combination of transactions is generally referred to as a 'zero-cost collar.' The expiration dates and notional amounts correspond to the amount and timing of forecasted foreign currency sales. If the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the  purchased  put  option  value  reduces  to  zero  and  BMS  benefits  from  the  increase  in  the  U.S.  dollar  equivalent  value  of  our anticipated foreign currency cash flows; however, this benefit would be capped at the strike level of the written call, which forms the upper end of the collar.\n\nIn 2020, Treasury lock hedge contracts were entered into with a total notional value of $2.1 billion to hedge future interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of long-term debt to fund the MyoKardia acquisition. The Treasury lock contracts were terminated  upon  the  issuance  of  the  2020  unsecured  senior  notes  and  the  $51  million  proceeds  were  included  in  Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss).\n\nNet Investment Hedges Non-U.S. dollar borrowings of \u20ac950 million ($1.1 billion) at December 31, 2021 are designated as net investment hedges to hedge euro currency exposures of the net investment in certain foreign affiliates and are recognized in longterm debt. The effective portion of foreign exchange gain on the remeasurement of euro debt was included in the foreign currency translation component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss with the related offset in long-term debt.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nCertain of the Company's revenues relate to operating-type lease ('OTL') arrangements. Leases are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (or ASC 840, Leases ('ASC 840') prior to January 1, 2019). Equipment lease revenue for OTL agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease, and the cost of customer-leased equipment is recorded within property, plant and equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over the equipment's estimated useful life. Depreciation expense associated with the leased equipment under OTL arrangements is reflected in cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The OTLs are generally not cancellable until after an initial term and may or may not require the customer to purchase a minimum number of consumables or tests throughout the contract term. The Company also enters into sales-type lease ('STL') arrangements with customers which result in earlier recognition of equipment lease revenue as compared to an OTL.\n\nFor a contract with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis using the Company's best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct product or service in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers. Allocation of the transaction price is determined at the contracts' inception.\n\nShipping and Handling-Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. Revenue derived from shipping and handling costs billed to customers is included in sales.\n\nAdvertising-Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nResearch and Development-The Company conducts research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products, enhancing the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of the Company's existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of the Company's products are appropriate. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIncome Taxes-The Company's income tax expense represents the tax liability for the current year, the tax benefit or expense for the net change in deferred tax liabilities and assets during the year, as well as reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and return to provision adjustments. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the Company's tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on the Company's tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is 'more likely than not' that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination.  Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions.  The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions in income tax expense. Refer to Note 7 for additional information.\n\nProductivity Improvement and Restructuring-The Company periodically initiates productivity improvement and restructuring activities to appropriately position the Company's cost base relative to prevailing economic conditions and associated customer demand as well as in connection with certain acquisitions. Costs associated with productivity improvement and restructuring actions can include one-time termination benefits and related charges in addition to facility closure, contract termination and other related activities. The Company records the cost of the productivity improvement and restructuring activities when the associated liability is incurred.\n\nForeign Currency Translation-Exchange rate adjustments resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized in net earnings, whereas effects resulting from the translation of financial statements are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using year end exchange rates and income statement accounts are translated at weighted average rates. Net foreign currency transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the years presented. As discussed below, the Company uses its foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swap arrangements whereby existing U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings are effectively converted to foreign currency borrowings to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.",

These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. Currencies of our derivative instruments include the Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, and others. The Company does not enter into currency exchange rate  derivative  contracts  for  speculative  purposes.  The  gross  notional  amount  of  all  currency  exchange  rate  derivative  instruments outstanding was $13.8 billion and $14.7 billion at April 29, 2022 and April 30, 2021, respectively.\n\nThe  Company  also  uses  derivative  and  non-derivative  instruments  to  manage  the  impact  of  currency  exchange  rate  changes  on  net investments  in  foreign  currency-denominated  operations.  The  information  that  follows  explains  the  various  types  of  derivatives  and financial instruments used by the Company, reasons the Company uses such instruments, and the impact such instruments have on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and statements of income.\n\n## Freestanding Derivative Contracts\n\nFreestanding derivative contracts are primarily used to offset the Company's exposure to the change in value of specific foreign-currencydenominated assets and liabilities, and to offset variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The gross notional amount of the Company's freestanding currency exchange rate contracts outstanding at April 29, 2022 and April  30,  2021  was  $4.9  billion  and  $5.7  billion,  respectively.  The  Company's  freestanding  currency  exchange  rate  contracts  are  not designated  as  hedges,  and  therefore,  changes  in  the  value  of  these  contracts  are  recognized  in  earnings,  thereby  offsetting  the  current earnings effect of the related change in value of foreign-currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows.\n\nThe Company also uses total return swaps to hedge the liability of a non-qualified, deferred compensation plan. The gross notional amount of the Company's total return swaps outstanding at April 29, 2022 and April 30, 2021 was $226 million and $243 million, respectively. The Company's total return swaps are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these instruments are recognized in earnings.  The  cash  flows  related  to  the  Company's  freestanding  derivative  contracts  are  reported  as  operating  or  financing  activities, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged item, in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nForward  contracts  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  are  designed  to  hedge  the  variability  of  cash  flows  associated  with  forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. The gross notional amount of these contracts, designated as  cash  flow  hedges, outstanding at April 29, 2022 and April 30, 2021 was $8.8 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, and will mature within the subsequent three-year period. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the  derivative  instrument  is  reported  as  a  component  of accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss .  The  gain  or  loss  on  the  derivative instrument  is  reclassified  into  earnings  and  is  included  in other  operating  expense,  net or cost  of  products  sold in  the  consolidated statements of income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts excluded from the measurement  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  recognized  in  earnings  in  the  current  period.  The  cash  flows  related  to  all  of  the  Company's derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. No components of the hedge contracts were excluded in the measurement of hedge effectiveness, and no forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges were derecognized or discontinued during fiscal years 2022, 2021, or 2020.\n\nAt April 29, 2022 and April 30, 2021, the Company had $474 million in after-tax unrealized gains and $253 million in after-tax unrealized losses,  respectively,  associated  with  cash  flow  hedging  instruments  recorded  in accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss .  The  Company expects that $368 million of after-tax net unrealized gains at April 29, 2022 will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the next 12 months.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges\n\nThe  Company  has  designated  Euro-denominated  debt  as  a  net  investment  hedge  of  certain  of  its  European  operations  to  manage  the exposure to currency and exchange rate movements for foreign currency-denominated net investments in foreign operations. At April 29, 2022, the Company had \u20ac16.0 billion, or $17.0 billion, of outstanding Euro-denominated debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in certain of its European operations, which will mature in fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2051.\n\nIn  February  2021,  the  Company  de-designated  \u00a5300  billion  of  outstanding  Yen-denominated  debt  previously  designated  as  a  net investment hedge and concurrently entered into freestanding forward derivative contracts with a total notional value of \u00a5300 billion, or approximately $2.9 billion. These forward contracts were not designated as hedges. The Company used the proceeds from these forward derivative  contracts  to  repay  the  \u00a5300  billion  of Yen-denominated  debt  in  conjunction  with  the  maturity  of  these  forward  contracts  in March and April of 2021.\n\nFor instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss . The gains or losses are reclassified into earnings upon a liquidation event or deconsolidation of the foreign",

TMO, while not disclosing a direct dollar value for machinery and equipment, provides detailed depreciation policies, applying straight-line depreciation over 3 to 10 years, which reflects a structured and asset lifecycle-focused approach to managing its equipment. Together, these perspectives show that BMY maintains a moderate and consistent approach, JNJ emphasizes scale and expansion in equipment investment, and TMO prioritizes asset lifecycle management and depreciation discipline.",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nContract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings where the company's right to bill includes something other than the passage of time. Such amounts are recorded net of estimated losses resulting from the inability to invoice customers, which is primarily due to risk associated with the company's performance. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the amount of time expected to lapse until the company's right to consideration becomes unconditional.\n\nContract liabilities include billings in ex cess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenues on service contracts. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the periods over which remaining performance obligations are expected to be transferred to customers. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet if they arise from different performance obligations in the same contract.\n\nNoncurrent contract assets and noncurrent contract liabilities are included within other assets and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet, respectively (see Note 2).\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The company generally provides for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the property as follows: buildings and improvements, 25 to 40 years; machinery and equipment (including software), 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying statement of income.\n\n## Acquisition-related Intangible Assets\n\nAcquisition-related intangible assets include the costs of acquired customer relationships, product technology, tradenames, backlog and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, and are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 20 years. The company reviews these intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. When impairment indicators exist, the company determines whether the carrying value of its intangible assets exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows. In these situations, the carrying value is written down to fair value.\n\nIn addition, the company has tradenames that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired. The company may perform an optional qualitative assessment. If the company determines that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, no additional testing is necessary. If not, or if the company bypasses the optional qualitative assessment, it writes the carrying value down to the fair value, if applicable.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments include marketable securities, such as marketable equity securities, available for sale debt securities, and bank time deposits with maturities greater than three months, equity method investments, and non-marketable equity investments. The company classifies investments as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. Noncurrent investments are included in other assets.\n\nMarketable securities are stated at fair value with all realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable equity securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities recognized in other income/(expense).\n\nThe company accounts for investments in businesses using the equity method when it has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control (generally between 20% and 50% ownership), is not the primary beneficiary and has not elected the fair value option. The company has elected the fair value option of accounting for certain of its investments with readily determinable fair values that would otherwise be accounted for under the equity method (see Note 2). The company's share of gains and losses in, and impairments of, equity method investments are recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and are not eligible for the net asset value (NAV) practical ex pedient are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The company performs qualitative assessments to identify impairments of these investments. All gains and losses on non-equity method investments are recognized in other income/(expense).\n\n## Other Assets\n\nOther assets in the accompanying balance sheet include operating lease right-of-use assets, investments, deferred tax assets, pension assets, insurance recovery receivables related to product liability matters, certain intangible assets and other assets.",

      "question": "How do AbbVie, Eli Lilly, and Pfizer each account for advance payments in their financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to revenue recognition and contract liabilities?",
      "answer": "AbbVie reports a decrease in advance payments from $547 million in 2022 to $298 million in 2023, indicating a reduction in deferred inflows, possibly due to fulfillment of obligations or recognition of revenue. Eli Lilly discloses that contract liabilities arise from advance payments received before performance under the contract, and changes in these liabilities are driven by either receipt of new payments or performance against contracts. Pfizer specifically ties advance payments to Comirnaty-related deferred revenues, showing a decline from $2.5 billion in 2022 to $1.7 billion in 2023, with revenue recognition occurring as product control transfers to customers. Together, these disclosures highlight different focal points: AbbVie emphasizes tax asset treatment, Eli Lilly focuses on contract liability recognition and performance obligations, and Pfizer ties advance payments directly to product delivery schedules and contract fulfillment timelines.",

Gilead records allowances for estimated sales returns by analyzing historical return patterns, industry data for similar products, and contractual terms, and allows returns for damaged, defective, or near-expiration products, primarily in the U.S. Johnson & Johnson records sales returns based on historical sales and returns data, with its sales returns reserve consistently at approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales over the past three years, and specifically investigates products that have lost patent exclusivity or show unusual return patterns. Collectively, these approaches show that while all three companies rely on historical data, their methodologies and risk exposure vary based on product lifecycle, market dynamics, and contractual return policies.",

          "chunk_text": "## 1. Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Business\n\nAmgen Inc. (including its consolidated subsidiaries, referred to as 'Amgen,' 'the Company,' 'we,' 'our' or 'us') is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. We operate our business in one operating segment: human therapeutics. See Note 2, Segment and other information.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of Amgen  as  well  as  its  majority-owned  subsidiaries.  In  determining  whether  we  are  the  primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we consider whether we have both the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. We do not have any significant interests in any variable interest entities of which we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Product sales and sales deductions\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.\n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that an adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given period, can be affected by the mix of products sold. Included in sales deductions are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-period sales due to changes in estimates.\n\nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data with their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-period sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.\n\nOur payment terms vary by types and locations of customers and by products or services offered. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment is generally required in a term ranging from 30 to 120 days from date of shipment or satisfaction of the performance obligation. For certain products or services and certain customer types, we may require payment before products are delivered or services are rendered to customers.\n\nIndirect tax es collected from customers and remitted to government authorities that are related to sales of the Company's products, primarily in Europe, are excluded from revenues.\n\nAs a practical expedient, sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in SG&amp;A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## AMGEN INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## December 31, 2024",

          "chunk_text": "## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Product Sales\n\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when control of the product transfers to the customer, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, or in certain cases, upon the corresponding sales by our customer to a third party. Revenues are recognized net of estimated rebates and chargebacks, patient co-pay assistance, prompt pay discounts, distributor fees, sales return provisions and other related deductions. These deductions to product sales are referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. Our payment terms to customers generally range from 30 to 90 days; however, payment terms differ by jurisdiction, by customer and, in some instances, by type of product. Revenues from product sales, net of gross-to-net deductions, are recorded only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized is not probable of occurring when the uncertainty associated with gross-to-net deductions is subsequently resolved. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers are excluded from product sales. If we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of control and corresponding payment from the customer will be one year or less,  we  do  not  adjust  the  amount  of  consideration  for  the  effects  of  a  financing  component.  Shipping  and  handling  activities  are  considered  to  be  fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\n## Rebates and Chargebacks\n\nRebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements and include amounts due to payers and healthcare providers under various programs. These amounts may vary by product, payer and individual plans. Providers qualified under certain programs can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a discount. The wholesalers or distributors then charge the discount back to us.\n\nRebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, including product mix and pricing, historical and estimated payer mix and discount rates, among other inputs, which require significant estimates and judgment. We assess and update our estimates each reporting period to reflect actual claims and other current information.\n\nChargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are generally classified as reductions of Accounts receivable on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets. Rebates that are payable to third party payers and healthcare providers are recorded in Accrued rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Patient Co-Pay Assistance\n\nCo-pay assistance represents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them with prescription drug co-payments required by insurance. Our accrual for co-pay is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end.\n\n## Cash Discounts\n\nWe estimate  cash  discounts  based  on  contractual  terms,  historical  customer  payment  patterns  and  our  ex pectations  regarding  future  customer  payment patterns.\n\n## Distributor Fees\n\nUnder  our  inventory  management  agreements  with  our  significant  U.S.  wholesalers,  we  pay  the  wholesalers  a  fee  primarily  for  compliance  with  certain contractually-determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed-upon inventory levels. These distributor fees are based on a contractually-determined fixed percentage of sales.\n\n## Allowance for Sales Returns\n\nAllowances are made for estimated sales returns by our customers and are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. We typically permit returns if the product is damaged, defective, or otherwise cannot be used by the customer. In the U.S., we typically permit returns six months prior to and up to one year after the product expiration date. Outside the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\n\nOur estimates of sales returns are based primarily on analysis of our historical product return patterns, industry information reporting the return rates for similar products and contractual agreement terms. We also take into consideration known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product.\n\n## Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues\n\nRoyalty revenue is recognized in the period in which the obligation is satisfied and the corresponding sales by our corporate partners occur. Contract and other revenues are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other information\n\n## Critical accounting policies and estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GA A P). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. A ctual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company's operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\n\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\n\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates and discounts are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\n\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that have lost patent exclusivity, or that otherwise exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\n\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. In accordance with the Company's accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GA A P guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales v alue. Sales returns in the Innovativ e M edicine segment are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the M edTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and include volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total rev enues in fiscal y ear 2024 and 2023, respectively, and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in the fiscal year 2022 and are included in sales to customers.\n\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. A mounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.\n\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n37",

      "answer": "Amgen receives royalty income from third-party sales of licensed products, which is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends, indicating a proactive licensing model that monetizes intellectual property. Eli Lilly discloses that it both receives royalty payments from collaborations and may make royalty payments based on product sales if regulatory approvals are obtained, showing a balanced approach where royalty flows are contingent on developmental success. Pfizer, in contrast, highlights that royalty payments can be imposed on it due to third-party intellectual property claims, particularly in the context of patent disputes and biosimilar development, suggesting a more risk-exposed position where royalty obligations arise from litigation and market entry strategies. Together, these perspectives reveal that Amgen leverages IP for revenue, Eli Lilly manages a two-way royalty model tied to development milestones, and Pfizer faces royalty liabilities as a cost of competitive market entry.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues consist primarily of royalty income and corporate partner revenues. Royalties from licensees are based on third-party sales of licensed products and are recorded when the related third-party product sale occurs. Royalty income is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends. Corporate partner revenues are  composed  mainly  of  license  fees  and  milestones  earned  and  our  share  of  commercial  profits  generated  from  collaborations.  See Arrangements  with  multipleperformance obligations, discussed below.\n\n## Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into arrangements for the R&amp;D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and product candidates. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or goods, including intellectual property rights/licenses, R&amp;D services, manufacturing services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to Amgen in the form of nonrefundable, upfront license fees; development and commercial-performance milestone payments; royalty payments; and/or profit sharing.\n\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or by using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\n\nThe  consideration  allocated  to  each  distinct  performance  obligation  is  recognized  as  revenue  when  control  of  the  related  goods  or  services  is  transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will  not  occur.  We  utilize  the  sales-  and  usage-based  royalty  ex ception  in  arrangements  that  resulted  from  the  license  of  intellectual  property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nR&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical  manufacturing  costs;  contract  services  and  other  outside  costs;  information  systems'  costs;  and  amortization  of  acquired  technology  used  in  R&amp;D  with alternative future uses. R&amp;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with third-party R&amp;D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&amp;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSG&amp;A costs are primarily composed of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel;  facilities  and  overhead  costs;  outside  marketing,  advertising  and  legal  ex penses;  the  U.S.  healthcare  reform  federal  ex cise  fee  on  Branded  Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $987 million, $647 million and $841  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  SG &amp;A  ex penses  also  include  costs  and  cost  recoveries  associated  with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG &amp;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract,  we  determine  whether  an  arrangement  is  or  contains  a  lease.  For  all  leases,  we  determine  the  classification  as  either  operating  or financing. Operating leases are included in Other noncurrent assets, Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Lease recognition occurs at the commencement date, and lease liability amounts are based on the present value of lease payments made during the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Because most of our leases do not provide information to determine an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of",

We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in dev elopment and enter into research and dev elopment arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future ev ents linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achiev ement of an important point in the dev elopment life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approv al for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achiev ement of certain sales lev els). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the ev ent that regulatory approv al for marketing is obtained.\n\nIndiv idually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. Howev er, if milestones for multiple products cov ered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectiv ely, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often giv e us the discretion to unilaterally terminate dev elopment of the product, which would allow us to av oid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease dev elopment if the compound successfully achiev es milestone objectiv es. We v iew these payments as positiv e because they signify that the product is successfully mov ing through dev elopment and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.\n\n## APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjectiv e and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any giv en indiv idual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could dev elop different estimates. We believ e that, giv en current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adv erse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates hav e been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\n\n## Background and Uncertainties\n\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product rev enue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, prov isions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on rev enue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\n\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receiv e under these types of contracts.",

W e rely and expect to continue to rely on a com bination of intellectual property, including patent, tradem ark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and dom ain nam e protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreem ents, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. I f we fail to obtain and m aintain adequate intellectual property protection, we m ay not be able to prevent third parties from  launching generic or biosim ilar versions of our branded products, from  using our proprietary technologies or from  m arketing products that are very sim ilar or identical to ours. O ur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a tim ely basis. Sim ilarly, any term  extensions that we seek m ay not be granted on a tim ely basis, if at all, and any term  adjustm ents related to patent office delays in obtaining a patent m ay be reduced or elim inated entirely due to risks associated with changes in law relating to patent term s. In addition, our issued patents m ay not contain claim s sufficiently broad to protect us against claim s regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term  m ade by parties with sim ilar technologies or products or provide us with any com petitive advantage, including patent-based exclusivity in a particular technology or product area.\n\nFurther, legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governm ents could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from  enforcing intellectual property related to our products. F or exam ple, the W T O 's June 2022 M inisterial D ecision on the Agreem ent on T rade-R elated Aspects of I ntellectual P roperty R ights seeks to m ake it easier for certain W T O  m em bers to issue a com pulsory license on C O VID -19 vaccines.\n\nThe scope of our patent claim s also m ay vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country, its enforcem ent practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country's intellectual property fram ework (e.g., laws or regulations that prom ote or provide broad discretion to issue a com pulsory license). In countries that provide som e form  of regulatory exclusivity, m echanism s exist perm itting som e form  of challenge to our patents by com petitors or generic drug m arketers prior to or im m ediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic com panies are employing aggressive strategies, such as 'at-risk' launches that challenge our patent rights. M ost of the suits involve claim s by generic drug m anufacturers that patents covering our products, uses, processes or dosage form s are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosim ilar drug m anufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attem pts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair com petition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claim s m ay also be brought as counterclaim s to actions we bring to enforce our patents. W e are also party to other patent dam ages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payors, governm ents or other parties are seeking dam ages from  us for alleged delay of generic entry. W e also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-exam ination or opposition proceedings, before the U .S. P atent and T radem ark O ffice, the E uropean P atent O ffice, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents or a com petitors' patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosim ilar products could be introduced into the m arket resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. F or additional inform ation, including inform ation regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16A1 . F urther, if we are unable to m aintain our existing license agreem ents or other agreem ents pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold tradem ark registrations and have tradem ark applications pending in m any jurisdictions, any of which m ay be the subject of a governm ental or third-party objection, which could prevent the m aintenance or issuance of the tradem ark. As our products m ature, our reliance on our tradem arks and trade dress to differentiate us from  our com petitors increases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from  adopting, registering or using tradem arks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. W e seek to protect our proprietary inform ation, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our em ployees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary inform ation and confidentiality agreem ents upon the com m encem ent of their relationship with us. D espite these efforts and precautions, we m ay be unable to prevent a third-party from  copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal rem edies m ay not adequately com pensate us for the dam ages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others m ay independently and lawfully develop substantially sim ilar or identical products that circum vent our intellectual property by m eans of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\n\n## THIRD-PARTY INTE LLE CTU AL PR OPE R TY CLAIMS\n\nA properly functioning intellectual property regim e is essential to our business m odel. W e are com m itted to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other com panies, but the patent granting process is im perfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities m ay require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were im properly granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges m ay not always be successful.\n\nPart of our business depends upon identifying biosim ilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which m ay involve litigation, associated costs and tim e delays, and m ay ultim ately not be successful. T hese opportunities m ay arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In som e circum stances we m ay take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a 'first-to-m arket' or early m arket position for our products.\n\nThird parties m ay claim  that our products infringe one or m ore patents owned or controlled by them . C laim s of intellectual property infringem ent can be costly and tim e-consum ing to resolve, m ay delay or prevent product launches, and m ay result in significant royalty paym ents or dam ages or potential licensing agreem ents. F or exam ple, our R &amp;D  in a therapeutic area m ay not be first and another com pany or entity m ay have obtained relevant patents before us. W e are involved in patent-related disputes with third parties over our attem pts to market pharm aceutical products, including related to Abrysvo, C om irnaty and P axlovid. As we expand our m R N A portfolio, patent-related disputes m ay increase. O nce we have final regulatory approval of the related products, we m ay decide to com m ercially m arket these products even though associated legal proceedings (including any appeals) have not been resolved (i.e., 'at-risk' launch). I f one of our m arketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-prom otion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party m ay be awarded significant dam ages or royalty paym ents, or we m ay be prevented from  further sales of that product. Such dam ages m ay be enhanced as m uch as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n21",

The acquired definite-lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately 12 years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable i ntangible assets were determined using the \"income approach\" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends i mpacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.\n\nOther noncurrent assets primarily consist of $250 million of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe current portion of long-term debt assumed by AbbVie was repaid concurrent with the acquisition at the fair value of $99 million. See Note 10 for additional information.\n\nGoodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of ImmunoGen represents expected synergies including, the ability to: (i) expand AbbVie's product portfolio as well as the potential to increase revenue from future growth platforms, (ii) accelerate AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in the solid tumor space within oncology, (iii) leverage the respective strengths of each company, and (iv) enhance AbbVie's existing ADC development efforts. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nFollowing the acquisition date, the operating results of ImmunoGen have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2024, net revenues attributable to ImmunoGen were $578 million and operating losses attributable to ImmunoGen were $682 million, inclusive of $349 million of cash-settled, post-closing expense for ImmunoGen employee incentive awards, $179 million of inventory fair value stepup amortization and $157 million of intangible asset amortization. AbbVie also issued 0.3 million RSUs to holders of ImmunoGen equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Stock compensation expense related to RSUs issued at the acquisition date was not significant.\n\nAcquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were included in SG&amp;A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Pro Forma Financial Information\n\nThe following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie, ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics for 2024 and 2023 as if the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics had occurred on January 1, 2023:\n\n",

The year-ov er-year change in operating cash flows from 2023 to 2024 was primarily attributable to the following factors:\n\n- 2024 operating cash flows from continuing operations reflected a decrease of $322 million in net earnings from continuing operations in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n- Net earnings from continuing operations for 2024 also included $248 million higher noncash charges for impairments, intangible asset amortization, depreciation and amortization of an acquisition-related inv entory step-up compared to 2023, net of a decrease in unrealized inv estment gains/losses and stock compensation expense in 2024 as compared to 2023. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inv entory fair v alue adjustments. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease ('OTL') arrangements. Depreciation, amortization, impairments and stock compensation are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. Unrealized inv estment gains/losses impact net earnings from continuing operations without immediately impacting cash flows as the cash flow impact from inv estments occurs when the inv ested capital is returned to the Company.",

      "question": "How do the actual and projected returns on pension plan assets for CVS, MDT, and PFE in 2023 compare, and what does this reveal about their respective investment strategies and financial risk exposure?",
      "answer": "CVS reported an actual return on plan assets of -$23 million in 2023, indicating a loss. PFE\u2019s international pension plans also experienced negative returns, with an actual loss of $96 million on plan assets held at the end of the year. In contrast, MDT projected expected returns on plan assets ranging from 5.30% to 7.20% for U.S. pension benefits and 4.07% for non-U.S. plans, suggesting a more optimistic outlook compared to the realized losses at CVS and PFE. These differences suggest that MDT may be employing a more aggressive or diversified investment strategy, while CVS and PFE experienced adverse market impacts, potentially increasing their pension-related liabilities and affecting earnings stability.",

These  items  are  adjusted  after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, (ii) unwind of inventory purchase price adjustments, (iii) acquisition and integration  expenses,  (iv)  restructuring  costs,  (v)  accelerated  depreciation  and  impairment  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible assets, (vi) R&amp;D charges or other income resulting from up-front or contingent milestone payments in connection with the  acquisition  or  licensing  of  third-party  intellectual  property  rights,  (vii)  divestiture  gains  or  losses,  (viii)  stock  compensation resulting from accelerated vesting of Celgene awards and certain retention-related employee compensation charges related to the Celgene transaction, (ix) pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, (x) equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments, including adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments and (xi) amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from internal transfers of intangible and other assets to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the Celgene acquisition and the GILTI tax charge upon finalization of the Otezla* divestiture in 2020. We also provide international revenues for our priority products excluding the impact  of  foreign  exchange.  We  calculate  foreign  exchange  impacts  by  converting  our  current-period  local  currency  financial results  using  the  prior  period  average  currency  rates  and  comparing  these  adjusted  amounts  to  our  current-period  results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in Exhibit 99.2 to our Form 8K filed on February 4, 2022 and are incorporated herein by reference.\n\nNon-GAAP  information  is  intended  to  portray  the  results  of  our  baseline  performance,  supplement  or  enhance  management, analysts and investors' overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items  that  are  considered  by  us  to  not  be  reflective  of  our  ongoing  results.  In  addition,  this  information  is  among  the  primary indicators  that  we  use  as  a  basis  for  evaluating  performance,  allocating  resources,  setting  incentive  compensation  targets  and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(1) Associated costs include costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses.\n\n(2) The charges primarily include business combination costs, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, specifically for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, changes in amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a past acquisition.\n\n(3) We exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on our minority investments as we do not believe that these components of income or expense have a direct correlation to our ongoing or future business operations.\n\n(4) The charges represent estimated incremental costs of complying with the new European Union medical device regulations for previously registered products  and  primarily  include  charges  for  contractors  supporting  the  project  and  other  direct  third-party  expenses,  which  are  expected  to  be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2023.\n\n(5) The charges relate to the Company's June 2021 decision to stop the distribution and sale of the Medtronic HVAD System within the Mechanical Circulatory  Support  Operating  Unit  (MCS).  The  charges  included  $515  million  of  non-cash  impairments,  primarily  related  to  $409  million  of intangible asset impairments, as well as $366 million for commitments and obligations in connection with the decision, including patient support obligations,  restructuring,  and  other  associated  costs.  Medtronic  is  committed  to  serving  the  needs  of  the  approximately  3,500  patients  currently implanted with the HVAD System.\n\n(6) The net benefit primarily relates to the deferred tax impact associated with a step up in tax basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes and a change in tax rates  on  deferred  taxes  associated  with  intellectual  property,  which  are  partially  offset  by  the  amortization  on  previously  established  deferred  tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions and a charge related to a change in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion on certain historical earnings.\n\n(7) The charges relate to the abandonment of certain intangible assets in our Neuroscience segment.\n\n(8) The charges relate to the early redemption of approximately $6.0 billion of debt.\n\n(9) The net benefit primarily relates to the finalization of an audit at the IRS Appellate level for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and the capitalization of certain research and development costs for U.S. income tax purposes, which are partially offset by the impact of an intercompany sale of assets, and a tax basis adjustment and amortization of previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n\n## Free Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting additions to property, plant, and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. Free cash flow should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) and free cash flow are as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## L. Research and Development Expenses\n\nR&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&amp;D efforts, as well as costs incurred in connection with certain licensing arrangements. Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments we make to third parties under licensing arrangements as expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives regulatory approval, we record any milestone payments in Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we typically amortize the payments on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter.\n\n## M. Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets\n\nLong-lived assets include:\n\n- Property, plant and equipment , less accumulated depreciation-These assets are recorded at cost, including any significant improvements after purchase, less accumulated depreciation. Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual assets. Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.\n- Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization -These assets are recorded at fair value at acquisition. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized until a useful life can be determined.\n- Goodwill -Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized.\n\nAmortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization of intangible assets that are for a single function and depreciation of property, plant and equipment are included in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.\n\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record impairments of longlived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.\n\n## Specifically:\n\n- For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows for the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount is greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.\n- For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as brands and IPR&amp;D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review other than for IPR&amp;D assets, we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite-lived is appropriate.\n- For goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of the reporting unit over the implied fair value.\n\n## N. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\n\nWe may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives.\n\n- In connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and\n- In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges for site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.\n\nIncluded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired business. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of an asset, that incremental impact is classified in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate. Employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination. Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other similar costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred .\n\nOur business and platform functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&amp;D, as well as our corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement).\n\n## O. Cash Equivalents and Statement of Cash Flows\n\nCash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. If items meeting this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as Short-term investments .",

      "question": "How do AbbVie, Gilead, and Johnson & Johnson differ in the way they disclose and quantify their exposure to stock-based compensation costs, and what does this reveal about their respective equity incentive strategies?",
      "answer": "AbbVie reports a total expense for defined contribution and stock-based compensation plans, with $398 million in defined contribution plan expense in 2023 and a detailed equity incentive program under its Amended Plan, reserving 144 million shares for issuance. Gilead discloses $27 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance stock units (PSUs), indicating a more limited scope of future equity compensation obligations. Johnson & Johnson reports $1,087 million in stock-based compensation costs for 2023, with $907 million in unrecognized costs expected to be recognized over 1.8 years, and maintains a significantly larger equity compensation plan with 130 million shares available for future grants. These differences suggest that JNJ has a more expansive and ongoing equity incentive strategy, while ABBV and GILD show more constrained or mature approaches.",

      "answer": "CVS's basic EPS declined from $3.29 in 2022 to $3.67 in 2024, showing a slight improvement but still below the 2023 level of $6.49. LLY's basic EPS significantly increased from $6.93 in 2022 to $11.76 in 2024, indicating strong earnings growth. TMO's basic EPS also grew steadily, rising from $17.75 in 2022 to $16.58 in 2024, with a low point of $15.52 in 2023. Collectively, these trends suggest that LLY experienced the most substantial earnings growth, while TMO maintained relatively high and stable EPS, and CVS showed modest improvement with volatility in recent years.",

      "answer": "JNJ manages its exposure to international subsidiaries by deferring tax liabilities on undistributed earnings after 2017 and estimating a $0.5 billion tax impact if those earnings are repatriated. MRK administers pension benefits across its U.S. and international subsidiaries, with a total pretax unrecognized compensation expense of $1.1 billion related to stock-based awards. TMO actively hedges currency risk through financial instruments and estimates a $2.05 billion impact on equity from a 10% depreciation in the value of currencies tied to its international subsidiaries. These approaches reflect JNJ focusing on tax deferral, MRK on employee benefit alignment, and TMO on currency exposure mitigation.",

M anagement believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax  effect of this repatriation would be approx imately  $0.5 billion under currently  enacted tax  laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.\n\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A  liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n39",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fix ed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Swedish krona, Singapore dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Swiss franc. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company's debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024, the company's debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company's fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. G enerally, the fair market value of fix ed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company's debt at December 31, 2024 was $28.53 billion (Note 4). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's debt at December 31, 2024 would increase by approximately $1.98 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's debt at December 31, 2024 would decrease by approximately $1.76 billion.\n\nIn addition, the fair value of the company's cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements is subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's cross-currency interest rate swaps at December 31, 2024 would decrease by approximately $0.27 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company's cross-currency interest rate swaps at December 31, 2024 would increase by approximately $0.40 billion.\n\n## Currency Exchange Rates\n\nThe company views its investments in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company's investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency ex change rates. The functional currencies of the company's international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, euro, Swedish krona, Canadian dollars, Norwegian kroner and Swiss franc. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company's net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2024 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders' equity of approximately $2.05 billion.\n\nThe fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2024 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company's contracts would result in an unrealized loss on forward currencyexchange contracts of $32 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2024 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company's contracts would result in an additional unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $37 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.\n\nCertain of the company's cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2024 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $16 million on the company's net income.",

      "answer": "In 2021, BMY paid $189 million in cash for operating lease liabilities, MDT paid $216 million, and MRK paid $340 million. These figures indicate that MRK had the highest leasing activity and financial commitment among the three companies in 2021, followed by MDT and then BMY. The differences in cash outflows suggest varying degrees of reliance on leased assets, with MRK showing a more aggressive leasing posture, potentially tied to its broader operational footprint in manufacturing and R&D facilities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nEffective as of November 3, 2009, the Company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp. (MSD) and MSD executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the Company (excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. These guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  borrowings  require  that  Merck  comply  with  covenants  and,  at  December  31,  2021,  the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\n\nThe aggregate maturities of long-term debt for each of the next five years are as follows: 2022, $2.3 billion; 2023, $1.7 billion; 2024, $1.3 billion; 2025, $2.5 billion; 2026, $2.3 billion. Interest payments related to these debt obligations are as follows: 2022, $910 million; 2023, $875 million; 2024, $838 million; 2025, $771 million; 2026, $743 million.\n\nThe Company has a $6.0 billion credit facility that matures in June 2026. The facility provides backup liquidity for the Company's commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has not drawn funding from this facility.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company has operating leases primarily for manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, corporate offices,  employee  housing,  vehicles  and  certain  equipment. The  Company  determines  if  an  arrangement  is  a  lease  at  inception. When evaluating contracts for embedded leases, the Company exercises judgment to determine if there is an explicit or implicit identified  asset  in  the  contract  and  if  Merck  controls  the  use  of  that  asset.  Embedded  leases,  primarily  associated  with  contract manufacturing organizations, are immaterial. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that Merck will exercise that option. Real estate leases for facilities have an average remaining lease term of seven years, which include options to extend the leases for up to four years where applicable. Vehicle leases are generally in effect for four years. The  Company does not record short-term leases (leases with an initial  term  of  12  months  or  less)  on  the  balance  sheet; however, Merck currently has no short-term leases.\n\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the Company's leases do not have a readily determinable implicit discount rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments by asset class. On a quarterly basis, an updated incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the average remaining lease term of each asset class and the Company's pretax cost of debt for that same term. The updated rates for each asset class are applied prospectively to new leases. The Company does not separate lease components (e.g. payments for rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) from non-lease components (e.g. common-area maintenance costs) in the event that the agreement contains both. Merck includes both the lease and non-lease components for purposes of calculating the right-of-use asset and related lease liability (if the non-lease components are fixed). For vehicle leases and employee housing, the Company applies a portfolio approach to account for the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n\nCertain of the Company's lease agreements contain variable lease payments that are adjusted periodically for inflation or for actual operating expense true-ups compared with estimated amounts; however, these amounts are immaterial. Sublease income and  activity  related  to  sale  and  leaseback  transactions  are  immaterial.  Merck's  lease  agreements  do  not  contain  any  material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nOperating lease cost was $343 million in 2021, $340 million in 2020 and $333 million in 2019. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $340 million in 2021, $334 million in 2020 and $275 million in 2019. Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations were $117 million in 2021, $473 million in 2020 and $125 million in 2019.",

      "answer": "DHR emphasizes a structured, business-by-business R&D approach aimed at maintaining and improving its competitive position through continuous innovation, with a global footprint across North America, Europe, and Asia. GILD manages R&D expenses by evaluating scientific data, probability of regulatory approval, and market potential, and does not track R&D costs by product or phase, indicating a more flexible, portfolio-based strategy. PFE underscores the necessity of high-risk, high-cost R&D to replenish product lines and drive growth, highlighting the importance of regulatory approval success and commercial viability. Together, these approaches reveal that DHR focuses on operational consistency and global execution, GILD prioritizes dynamic resource allocation based on development likelihood and market opportunity, and PFE accepts high levels of risk and cost in pursuit of major innovation and long-term growth.",

      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) reports a 2023 lease payment of $176 million, Eli Lilly (LLY) discloses $117.6 million for the same year, and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) indicates a significantly higher 2023 lease obligation of $763 million. This comparison highlights that UNH has a much larger lease footprint relative to BMY and LLY, potentially reflecting a greater reliance on leased facilities across its healthcare services operations. BMY and LLY, being more R&D and manufacturing-focused, show more moderate lease commitments. The disparity suggests differing capital structures and operational footprints among these healthcare leaders.",

During  the  fiscal  year ended April 26, 2024, the Company recognized $324 million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of April 28, 2023. During the fiscal year ended April 28, 2023, the Company recognized $240 million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue at April 29, 2022.\n\nRemaining performance obligations include goods and services that have not yet been delivered or provided under existing, noncancellable contracts with minimum purchase commitments. At April 26, 2024, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to unsatisfied performance obligations for executed contracts with an original duration of one year or more was approximately $0.5 billion. The Company expects to recognize revenue on the majority of these remaining performance obligations over the next two years.\n\n## 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions\n\n## Acquisition Activity\n\nThe Company had acquisitions during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 that were accounted for as business combinations.  The assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were recorded and consolidated on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. G oodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to future, yet to be defined technologies, new customer relationships, existing workforce of the acquired businesses, and synergies expected to arise after the Company's acquisition of these businesses. The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of income since the date each business was acquired. The results of operations of acquired businesses and the pro forma impact of the acquisitions during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was not significant, either individually or in the aggregate, to the consolidated results of the Company. Purchase price allocation adjustments for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 business combinations were not significant.\n\n## Fiscal Year 2024\n\nThe acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired during the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024 was $335 million. Based on preliminary valuations, assets acquired were primarily comprised of $131 million of goodwill, $150 million of IPR&amp;D, and $29 million of technology-based intangible assets with estimated useful lives of 10 years. For tax  purposes, $51 million of goodwill is deductible while $80 million is not deductible.  The  Company recognized $30  million  of  non-cash  contingent  consideration liabilities  in  connection  with  these  business  combinations  during  the  fiscal  year  ended April  26,  2024,  which  are  comprised  of  revenue  and  product  development milestone-based payments.\n\n## Fiscal Year 2023\n\n## Intersect ENT\n\nOn May 13, 2022, the Company acquired Intersect ENT, a global ear, nose, and throat (ENT) medical technology leader. The acquisition expands the Neuroscience segment portfolio of products used during ENT procedures, and combined with the Company's navigation, powered instruments, and existing tissue health products, offers a broader suite of solutions to assist surgeons treating patients who suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Total consideration, net of cash acquired, for the transaction, in which the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Intersect ENT for $28.25 per share, was $1.2 billion consisting of $1.1 billion of cash and $98 million previously held investments in  Intersect  ENT.  The  Company acquired $615  million  of  goodwill,  $635  million  of  technology-based  intangible  assets,  $35  million  of customer-related intangible assets, and $13 million of tradenames with estimated useful lives of 20 years. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Revenue and net loss attributable to Intersect ENT since the date of acquisition as well as costs incurred in connection with the acquisition included in the consolidated statements of income were not significant for fiscal year 2023.\n\n## Affera, Inc.\n\nOn August 30, 2022, the Company acquired Affera, Inc. (Affera) a privately-held company focused on the development of cardiac mapping and navigation systems and catheter-based  cardiac  ablation  technologies.  The  acquisition  ex pands  the  Cardiovascular  segment  suite  of  advanced  cardiac  ablation  products  and  accessories, including its first cardiac mapping and navigation platform. Total consideration, net of cash acquired for the transaction, was $904 million. The Company acquired $660 million of goodwill and $300 million of IPR&amp;D, which was capitalized into intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. The goodwill is not deductible for tax  purposes. The Company recognized $201 million of non-cash contingent consideration liabilities in connection with the acquisition, which are comprised of product development milestone-based payments. Revenue and net loss attributable to Affera since the date of acquisition as well as costs incurred in connection with the acquisition included in the consolidated statements of income were not significant for fiscal year 2023.",

      "question": "How do AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Pfizer differ in their upfront payment strategies for in-licensing oncology-related assets, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to innovation and partnership risk?",
      "answer": "AbbVie made a $750 million upfront payment to Genmab in 2020 for access to three early-stage bispecific antibody programs, including epcoritamab, reflecting a high-risk, high-reward strategy focused on early-stage oncology innovation. Bristol-Myers Squibb paid $150 million to Immatics and $200 million to Agenus in 2021 for global exclusive licenses to their TCR and bispecific antibody programs, indicating a more diversified upfront investment approach across multiple modalities. Pfizer, in contrast, made a relatively smaller $75 million upfront payment to Biogen in 2020 for the sale of its CK1 assets, suggesting a more conservative or opportunistic approach to upfront payments, possibly focused on divesting rather than acquiring early-stage oncology assets. Collectively, these strategies highlight differing philosophies: AbbVie and BMS are more aggressive in acquiring early-stage innovation through substantial upfront payments, while Pfizer appears more focused on monetizing its internal pipeline through asset sales.",

Under the terms of the agreement, Genmab granted to AbbVie an exclusive license to its epcoritamab (DuoBody-CD3xCD20), DuoHexaBody-CD37 and DuoBody-CD3x5T4 programs. For epcoritamab, the companies will share commercial responsibilities in the U.S. and Japan, with AbbVie responsible for further global commercialization. Genmab will record net revenues in the U.S. and Japan, and the parties will share equally in pre-tax profits from these sales. Genmab will receive tiered royalties on remaining global sales. For the discovery research partnership, Genmab will conduct Phase 1 studies for these programs and AbbVie retains the right to opt-in to program development. During 2020, AbbVie made an upfront payment of $750 million, which was recorded to IPR&amp;D in the consolidated statement of earnings. AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $3.2 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones for all programs.\n\n## Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nIn October 2019, AbbVie and Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Reata) entered into an amended and restated license agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Reata reacquired exclusive development, manufacturing and commercialization rights concerning its proprietary Nrf2 activator product platform originally licensed to AbbVie for territories outside of the United States with respect to bardoxolone methyl and worldwide with respect to omaveloxolone and other next-generation Nrf2 activators. As consideration for the rights reacquired by Reata, AbbVie received a total of $250 million as of December 31, 2020 and $80 million in cash in 2021. Total consideration of $330 million was recognized in other operating (income) expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in 2019. In addition, AbbVie will receive low single-digit, tiered royalties from worldwide sales of omaveloxolone and certain nextgeneration Nrf2 activators.\n\n## Other Arrangements\n\nIn addition to the significant arrangements described above, AbbVie entered into several other arrangements resulting in charges to IPR&amp;D of $192 million in 2021, $248 million in 2020 and $385 million in 2019. In connection with the other individually insignificant early-stage arrangements entered into in 2021, AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $5.5 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\n## Note 6 Collaborations\n\nThe company has ongoing transactions with other entities through collaboration agreements. The following represent the significant collaboration agreements impacting 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.\n\nIn December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of Imbruvica, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and certain compounds structurally related to Imbruvica, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States.\n\nThe collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize Imbruvica outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs.",

      "question": "How do Abbott (ABT), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and Merck (MRK) each characterize their exposure to cost of goods sold (COGS) pressures in 2021, and what does this reveal about the differing impacts of supply chain disruptions and manufacturing challenges across the healthcare sector?",
      "answer": "In 2021, Abbott reported a decline in gross profit margins from 52.2% in 2020 to 50.5%, citing increases in various manufacturing costs and restructuring charges. Bristol-Myers Squibb highlighted significant dependence on COGS efficiency, noting that supply chain disruptions, including raw material sourcing and manufacturing delays, could materially affect profitability, particularly for complex products like CAR T cell therapies. Merck disclosed a reduction in cost of sales from $247 million in 2020 to $167 million in 2021, indicating improved cost control in manufacturing, especially under its alliance agreements such as with Lynparza. These differences suggest that while all three companies faced COGS-related pressures, Abbott was most directly impacted by internal restructuring and pandemic-related volatility, BMY emphasized external supply chain risks, and MRK demonstrated relative cost optimization in its alliance-based operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABT \u2192 COGS: Abbott's gross profit margin dropped to 50.5% in 2021 due to increased manufacturing costs and restructuring charges, including a $499 million restructuring cost in the Diagnostic Products segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating Earnings\n\nGross profit margins were 52.2 percent of net sales in 2021, 50.5 percent in 2020 and 52.5 percent in 2019. In 2021,  the  increase  primarily  reflects  the  effects  of  higher  sales  volume,  higher  manufacturing  utilization,  and  the nonrecurrence of the 2020 impairment of intangible assets, partially offset by increases in various manufacturing costs and the impact of higher restructuring charges. In 2020, the decrease primarily reflects the mix of sales across Abbott's various businesses and operational inefficiencies due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as the increase in intangible asset amortization, the impairment of intangible assets and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on gross margin.\n\nResearch and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $2.7 billion in 2021, and $2.4 billion in both 2020 and 2019. The increase in 2021 R&amp;D spending was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development. R&amp;D spending in 2020 was relatively flat compared to 2019 as the impact of the immediate expensing in 2019 of an R&amp;D asset valued at $102 million that was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. was partially offset by the $55 million impairment of an in-process R&amp;D intangible asset in 2020. R&amp;D expense in 2020 also reflects lower integration and restructuring costs in 2020 related to R&amp;D, partially offset by higher spending on various projects.\n\nSelling,  general  and  administrative  (SG&amp;A)  expenses  increased  16.8  percent  in  2021  due  primarily  to  higher selling  and  marketing  spending  to  drive  growth  across  various  businesses  and  the  nonrecurrence  of  $100  million  of income in 2020 from a litigation settlement. The increase in 2021 also includes charges related to certain litigation. SG&amp;A expenses  were  basically  flat  in  2020  compared  to  2019.  In  2020,  the  favorable  effect  of  foreign  exchange, income of approximately $100 million from a litigation settlement in 2020, lower spending due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, and the impact of various cost saving initiatives were offset by higher spending to drive growth in various businesses.\n\n## Restructurings\n\nOn May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter in projected testing demand  driven  by  several  factors,  including  significant  reductions  in  cases  in  the  U.S.  and  other  major  developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority's updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset write-downs of $80 million,  inventory-related  charges  of  $248  million,  and  other  exit  costs,  which  included  contract  cancellations  and employee-related costs of $171 million.\n\nIn  the  second  half  of  2021,  as  the  Delta  and  Omicron  variants  of  COVID-19  spread  and  the  number  of  new COVID-19  cases  increased  significantly,  particularly  in  the  U.S.,  demand  for  rapid  COVID-19  tests  increased significantly. As  a  result,  in  the  second  half  of  2021, Abbott  sold  approximately  $181  million  of  inventory  that  was previously  estimated  to  have  no  net  realizable  value  under  the  second  quarter  restructuring  action.  In  addition,  the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $58 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the second half of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $23 million and primarily represent severance obligations.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2021, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of  St.  Jude  Medical,  Inc.  (St.  Jude  Medical)  into  the  Medical  Devices  segment,  and  Alere  Inc.  (Alere)  into  the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2018, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $41 million. From 2019 to 2021, Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges totaling approximately $95 million, comprised of $10 million in 2021, $13 million in 2020, and $72 million in 2019. Approximately $31 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $5 million was  recorded  in  Research  and  development,  and  approximately  $59  million  was  recorded  in  Selling,  general  and administrative  expense  over  the  last  three  years. As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  accrued  liabilities  remaining  in  the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $9 million.\n\nFrom  2017  to  2020, Abbott  management  approved  plans  to  streamline  operations  in  order  to  reduce  costs  and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. As of December 31, 2018, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $70 million. From 2019 to 2020, Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges totaling approximately $102 million, comprised of $36  million  in  2020  and  $66  million  in  2019.  Approximately  $22  million  was  recorded  in  Cost  of  products  sold, approximately $30 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $50 million was recorded in Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  over  the  two  years.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  accrued  liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $24 million.",

If we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors' products in the marketplace, this could have a material negative impact on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## We could experience difficulties, delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.\n\nOur product supply and related patient access has been, and could in the future be, negatively impacted by difficulties, delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products. Some of the difficulties, delays and disruptions  include:  (i)  product  seizures  or  recalls  or  forced  closings  of  manufacturing  plants;  (ii)  our  failure,  or  the failure of any of our vendors or suppliers, to comply with cGMP and other applicable regulations or quality assurance guidelines  that  could  lead  to  manufacturing  shutdowns,  product  shortages  or  delays  in  product  manufacturing;  (iii) manufacturing, quality assurance/quality control, supply problems or governmental approval delays; (iv) the failure of a supplier,  including  sole  source  or  single  source  suppliers,  to  provide  us  with  the  necessary  raw  materials,  supplies  or finished goods within a reasonable timeframe and with required quality; (v) the failure of a third-party manufacturer to supply us with bulk active or finished product on time; (vi) construction or regulatory approval delays for new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for our biologics products, such as Opdivo;  (vii)  the  failure  to  meet  new  and  emerging  regulations  requiring  products  to  be  tracked  throughout  the distribution channels using unique identifiers to verify their authenticity in the supply chain; (viii) other manufacturing or distribution  issues,  including  limits  to  manufacturing  capacity  and  changes  in  the  types  of  products  produced,  such  as biologics, physical limitations or other business interruptions; and (ix) disruptions in supply chain continuity, including from market forces (such as the recent stress on global logistics), natural disasters (such as hurricanes), global disease outbreaks (such as COVID-19), acts of war or terrorism or other unforeseeable or unavoidable events that materially impact one or more of our facilities or a critical supplier.\n\nIn addition, manufacturing processes for novel cell-based therapies, such as CAR T cell therapies, are still evolving, and our  processes  may  be  more  complicated  or  more  expensive  than  the  approaches  taken  by  our  current  and  future competitors.  Our  ability  to  source  raw  materials  and  supplies  used  to  manufacture  our  CAR  T  cell  therapies  and  to develop consistent and reliable manufacturing processes and distribution networks with an attractive cost of goods could impact future anticipated revenue and gross profit for our CAR T cell therapies. Furthermore, we may face challenges with  sourcing  raw  materials  and  supplies  for  clinical  and,  if  approved,  commercial  manufacturing.  Logistical  and shipment delays and other factors not in our control could prevent or delay the delivery of our product candidates and marketed products to patients. Additionally, we are required to maintain a complex chain of identity and custody with respect to patient material as such material enters into and moves through the manufacturing process. As a result, even slight deviations at any point in the production process for our CAR T cell therapies or in material used in our CAR T cell therapies could result in loss of product or regulatory remedial action, which could adversely affect our future anticipated revenues and/or profitability related to our CAR T cell therapies.\n\n## We may encounter difficulties integrating ours and Celgene's businesses and operations and, therefore, may not fully realize the projected benefits from our acquisition of Celgene.\n\nThe ultimate success of our acquisition of Celgene and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition, including the expected cost savings and avoidance from synergies, innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies, depends on, among other things, how effective we are in integrating the Bristol Myers Squibb and Celgene operations, products and employees.\n\nWe are in the process of integrating a large number of manufacturing, operational and administrative systems to achieve consistency  throughout  the  combined  company,  including  with  respect  to  human  capital  management,  portfolio rationalization,  finance  and  accounting  systems,  sales  operations  and  product  distribution,  pricing  systems  and methodologies,  cybersecurity  systems,  compliance  programs  and  internal  controls  processes.  This  integration  is  a complex, costly and time-consuming process. If any difficulties in the integration of our operations were to occur, they could adversely affect our business, including, among other ways, causing a failure to meet demand for our products, or adversely affect our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, alliance partners, creditors, clinical trial investigators and managers of our clinical trials.\n\nEvents outside our control, including changes in regulation and laws as well as economic trends, also could adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from this acquisition.\n\n## Regulatory, Intellectual Property, Litigation, Tax and Legal Compliance Risks\n\n## Litigation  claiming  infringement  of  intellectual  property  may  adversely  affect  our  future  revenues  and  operating earnings.\n\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are, and in the future may be, involved in various legal proceedings, including patent litigation, such as claims that our patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer or where third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of their",

This indicates a strong emphasis on expanding its pharmaceutical portfolio through both internal development and external innovation. DHR disclosed a more modest increase in R&D expense, rising from $441 million in 2023 to $584 million in 2024, suggesting a measured approach to R&D investment, possibly focused on sustaining innovation in its core medical technology or water infrastructure businesses. MDT maintained a relatively stable R&D expense of $2.735 billion in 2024 compared to $2.696 billion in 2023, signaling a steady commitment to innovation in its medical device segment. Together, these figures reveal differing innovation strategies: BMY is aggressively scaling R&D to support a broader and more dynamic drug portfolio, DHR is increasing R&D moderately likely to support incremental innovation, and MDT is maintaining consistent investment to sustain leadership in its device markets.",

          "chunk_text": "\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our contingent consideration obligations are primarily the result of our acquisition of Teneobio in October 2021, which obligates us to make payments to the former shareholders upon achievement of separate development and regulatory milestones with regard to various R&amp;D programs. In 2023, the development  of AMG  340  was  terminated,  resulting  in  a  decrease  of  the  related  contingent  consideration  liability.  During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability of $165 million, which was primarily related to the termination of AMG  340, was recognized in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and included in Other items, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 13, G oodwill and other intangible assets, for the impact on the related IPR&amp;D asset.\n\n## Summary of the fair values of other financial instruments\n\n## Cash equivalents\n\nThe fair values of cash equivalents are approximated at their carrying values due to the short-term nature of such financial instruments.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nWe estimate the fair values of our fix ed-rate notes by using Level 2 inputs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate fair values of our fixed-rate notes were $54.9 billion and $59.2 billion, respectively, and the carrying values of our fix ed-rate notes were $58.3 billion and $60.6 billion, respectively. The estimates of the fair values of our term loans approximate their carrying values as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 as these debt instruments bear interest at floating rates.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between fair value measurement levels, and except with respect to the IPR&amp;D intangible impairment of AMG 340 in 2023 as disclosed in Note 13, G oodwill and other intangible assets, there were no material remeasurements to the fair values of assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n\n## 19. Derivative instruments\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. To reduce our risks related to such exposures, we use or have used certain derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward, foreign currency option, cross-currency swap, forward interest rate and interest rate swap contracts. We have designated certain of our derivatives as cash flow and fair value hedges; we also have derivatives not designated as hedges. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nWe are exposed to possible changes in the values of certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily associated with our euro-denominated international product sales. The foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure associated with cash inflows from our international product sales is partially offset by corresponding cash outflows from our international operating expenses. To further reduce this exposure, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our projected international product sales up to a maximum of three years into the future; and at any given point in time, a higher percentage of nearer-term projected product sales is being hedged than in successive periods.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $7.2 billion, $6.6 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. We have designated these foreign currency forward contracts, which are primarily euro based, as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, we record unrealized gains and losses on these contracts in AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and we reclassify them to Product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.",

The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate the fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs.\n\n## Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts\n\nOur foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of 18 months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Level 3 Inputs\n\n## Contingent Consideration Liability\n\nIn connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR G mbH ('MYR'), we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to \u20ac300 million, subject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.\n\nThe following table summarizes the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liability:\n\n",

In connection with this decision, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $881 million, including $58 million recognized in costs of products sold and $823 million recognized within other operating expense (income), net in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income  in  fiscal  year  2022 . The charges  included  $515  million  of  non-cash  impairments  and  write-downs  primarily  related  to $409  million  of intangible  asset  impairments and $58  million  of  inventory  write-downs.  The  Company  also  recorded  charges  of  $366  million  for  commitments  and obligations associated with the decision, which included charges for patient support obligations, restructuring, and other associated costs.\n\n## Contingent Consideration\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  potential  payment  of  future  consideration  that  is  contingent  upon  the  achievement  of  certain  product development milestones and/or contingent on the acquired business reaching certain performance milestones. A liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period, and the change in fair value is recognized within other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe fair value of contingent consideration liabilities at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 was $149 million and $206 million, respectively. At April 26, 2024, $ 96 million was recorded in other accrued expenses , and $53 million was recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

      "question": "How do Abbott, Thermo Fisher, and UnitedHealth each disclose product revenues in their 2023 filings, and what does this reveal about their distinct revenue risk profiles in the healthcare sector?",
      "answer": "Abbott highlights regulatory risks that could delay product approvals or disrupt existing product revenues, citing the impact of its February 2022 infant formula recall and consent decree with the FDA. Thermo Fisher quantitatively reports declining product revenues from $30,361 million in 2021 to $25,243 million in 2023, indicating potential market pressures. UnitedHealth specifies that its product revenues are primarily tied to pharmacy networks, including the cost of pharmaceuticals net of rebates, dispensing fees, and co-payments, with revenue recognized upon prescription dispensing. These disclosures reflect Abbott's operational and regulatory risk exposure, Thermo Fisher's declining revenue trend, and UnitedHealth's dependency on pharmacy network dynamics.",

      "question": "How do the 'Other assets and liabilities, net' positions of DHR ($49M liability), GILD ($187M liability), and LLY ($19.3M liability) reflect different approaches to acquisition accounting, and what might this indicate about their respective post-M&A liquidity profiles and balance sheet flexibility?",
      "answer": "DHR reports a $49M net liability for 'Other assets and liabilities, net' as part of a larger acquisition with $5,735M in net assets acquired, suggesting significant restructuring or contingent liabilities that could constrain near-term liquidity. GILD shows a much larger $187M net liability within a smaller overall acquisition framework ($1,561M total consideration), indicating more complex post-deal obligations that may affect financial ratios like debt-to-equity. LLY's relatively minor $19.3M net liability in the context of a $1,338.5M acquisition suggests fewer post-closing balance sheet adjustments, potentially preserving greater short-term financial flexibility. Together, these figures reveal divergent M&A execution strategies\u2014DHR managing large-scale integration risks, GILD facing proportionally greater post-acquisition liabilities, and LLY maintaining cleaner balance sheet transitions.",

      "answer": "AbbVie reports rebate and chargeback accruals totaling $56.8 billion in 2023, using internal and external data to estimate inventory levels and rebate claims processing lag times. Abbott estimates rebates based on historical trends and current changes, with settlement generally occurring one to six months after sale, and notes that rebate accrual adjustments have not been material to net income. Pfizer applies an experience ratio based on prior rebate payments and prescriptions to estimate accruals, with U.S. chargebacks settled within two to five weeks and European rebates estimated using third-party data and invoiced sales. These approaches reflect differences in scale, data reliance, and timing of rebate settlements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABBV \u2192 Rebates: AbbVie recorded $56.8 billion in rebate and chargeback accruals in 2023. The company uses internal and external data to estimate inventory levels and rebate claims processing lag times, which can be significant.",

          "chunk_text": "\nIf recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $4.3 billion in 2024 and $5.6 billion in 2023. The \"Increase due to current year tax positions\" and \"Increase due to prior year tax positions\" in the table above include amounts related to federal, state and i nternational tax items.\n\nAbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized a gross income tax benefit of $179 million in 2024 and gross income tax expense of $430 million in 2023 and $339 million in 2022 for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and penalties of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024, $1.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible that the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by up to $40 million in connection with statute of limitation expirations. The company has various federal, state and foreign examinations ongoing. Finalizing examinations with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and as a result, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of resolution for certain unrecognized tax benefits. All significant federal, state and international tax matters have been concluded for years before 2009. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties.\n\n## Note 15 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies\n\nAbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. For litigation matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, beyond the amounts accrued. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any l i a bi l i ty a ri s i ng out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.\n\n## Antitrust Litigation\n\nLawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violated federal and state antitrust l a ws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of six individual plaintiff lawsuits and a certified class action by Niaspan direct purchasers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated\n\n## 95 | 2024 Form 10-K",

In most of these agreements, howev er, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. In addition, we obtain or receiv e the benefits of representations and warranties insurance in connection with certain acquisitions.

Ov er the last sev eral years, Danaher has separated and disposed of multiple businesses using a combination of sale, spin-off, split-off, initial public offering and other transactions (collectiv ely, the 'Dispositions'). The Dispositions and any future, similar transactions pose risks and challenges that could negativ ely impact our business and financial statements. For example, div estitures or other dispositions can dilute the Company's earnings per share, hav e other adv erse financial, tax and accounting impacts and distract management, disputes can arise with the new owners of the div ested/disposed business, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the transaction and the transaction may not yield greater net benefits to Danaher and its shareholders than if it had not occurred. In addition, we hav e retained responsibility for and/or hav e agreed to prov ide indemnification against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to the businesses that were subject to the Dispositions and other businesses we or our predecessors hav e sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our business or financial statements but there can be no assurance that this fav orable pattern will continue.\n\nIn addition, with respect to the liabilities for which other parties hav e agreed to indemnify us in connection with the Dispositions, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we hav e against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities, or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy their respectiv e indemnification obligations. It is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between Danaher and such other parties and require Danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties. Each of these risks could negativ ely affect our business and financial statements.\n\n## We could incur significant liability if our dispositions of any of Fortive Corporation, Envista Holdings Corporation or Veralto Corporation is determined to be a taxable transaction.\n\nWe have receiv ed opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that the dispositions of Fortiv e Corporation in 2016, Env ista Holdings Corporation in 2019 and Veralto Corporation in 2023 each qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Rev enue Code. These opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respectiv e businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respectiv e opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Rev enue Serv ice ('IRS') could determine on audit that any such transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or hav e been v iolated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respectiv e opinion.

The Company continues to be a target of cyber-attacks that could lead to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations.\n\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications, complex information technology systems, computing infrastructure, and cloud service providers (collectively , IT systems) to conduct critical operations and financial reporting. Certain of these systems are managed, hosted, provided  or  used  by  third  parties  to  assist  in  conducting  the  Company's  business.  Disruption,  degradation,  or  manipulation  of  these  IT  systems  through intentional or accidental means by the Company's employees, third parties with authorized access or unauthorized third parties could adversely affect key business processes. Cyber-attacks against the Company's IT systems or third-party providers' IT systems, such as cloud-based systems, could result in exposure of confidential information, the modification of critical data, and/or the failure of critical operations. M isuse of any of these IT systems could result in the disclosure of sensitive personal information or the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property , or other confidential business information. The Company continues to leverage new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to replace outmoded technology and improve the efficacy and efficiency of its business processes, including data acquisition, the use of which can create new risks. In addition, the Company's A nimal Health business sells technology products that, when deployed, could potentially be compromised by a third party and cause disruption both internally and externally.\n\nAlthough the aggregate impact of cyber-attacks and network disruptions on the Company's operations and financial condition has not been material to date, the Company continues to be a target of events of this nature and expects them to continue. The Company monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of Company IT systems to identify and attempt to reduce these risks and continues to do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that the Company's efforts to protect its data and IT systems or the efforts of third-party providers to protect their IT systems will be successful in preventing disruptions to the Company's operations, including its manufacturing, research, and sales operations. Such disruptions have in the past and could in the future result in loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from the Company's or the Company's third-party providers' databases or IT systems and have in the past and could in the future also result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to the Company and substantial remediation costs.\n\n## The Company is increasing its use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to automate processes, analyze data, and support decision-making which poses inherent risks.\n\nThe Company's growing use of artificial intelligence (A I) systems to automate processes, analyze data, and support decision-making poses inherent risks. Flaws, biases, or malfunctions in these systems could lead to operational disruptions, data loss, or erroneous decision-making, impacting the Company's business operations,  financial  condition,  and  reputation.  Ethical  and  legal  challenges  may  arise,  including  biases  or  discrimination  in A I  outcomes,  noncompliance  with  data  protection  regulations  and  laws  specifically  governing  the  use  of A I  systems  and  tools,  and  lack  of  transparency .  Furthermore,  the deployment of AI systems could expose the Company to increased cybersecurity threats, such as data breaches and unauthorized access leading to financial losses, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. The Company also faces competitive risks if it fails to adopt A I or other machine learning technologies in a timely fashion.\n\n## Social media and mobile messaging platforms present risks and challenges.\n\nThe inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain social media and mobile messaging channels could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications, including from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information. In addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about the Company or its products on any social networking platforms could damage the Company's reputation, brand image and goodwill. Further, the disclosure of non-public Company-sensitive information by the Company's workforce or others through external media channels could lead to information loss. A lthough there are internal Company Social M edia and M obile M essaging Policies that guide employees on appropriate personal and professional use of these platforms for communication about the Company, the processes in place may not completely secure and protect information. Identifying potential new points of unauthorized entry as new communication tools expand also presents new challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "In addition, critics of the 12-year ex clusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law may continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law's provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. In 2019, the Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12-year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as 'umbrella exclusivity').  If  the  FDA  were  to  decide  that  umbrella  ex clusivity  does  not  apply  to  biological  reference  products  or  were  to  make  other  changes  to  the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, eliminate the standard for interchangeability and declare by law that all biosimilars are de facto interchangeable with their reference products, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and pass new laws requiring more disclosure in the FDA's Orange Book and Purple Book. For example, in 2021 the FDA sent a letter to the USPTO describing ways to strengthen coordination between the two  agencies,  offering  training  to  help  identify  prior  art,  and  seeking  USPTO's  views  on  practices  that  ex tend  market  ex clusivities,  whether  pharmaceutical  patent examiners need additional resources, and the effect of post-grant challenges at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board on drug patents. The USPTO responded in July 2022 with a letter to the FDA stating that it is prepared to create formal mechanisms to collaborate with the FDA on patent issues that may affect the timing of generic and biosimilar entry. In January 2023, the USPTO held a joint listening session with the FDA on USPTO-FDA collaboration efforts.\n\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. See Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products-Competition. Additionally, if one of our products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends unexpired regulatory exclusivity for the product (and existing patents for a small molecule product) by an additional six months. Further, in 2023, the FDA released draft guidance that contemplates that the agency may no longer grant pediatric exclusivity for studies conducted solely to fulfill  Pediatric  Research  Equity Act (PREA) requirements.\n\nWhile we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had, and could increasingly have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. State laws may also have an impact on our business. For example, California is the first state to have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against 'pay for delay' settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement agreements are presumptively anticompetitive. The law may result in prolonged litigation and fewer settlements. Similar legislation based on California's law continues to be introduced in other states, including Connecticut and New Y ork. Efforts to target such settlements are also active at the federal level, including legislation introduced such as the Preserving Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act that adopts California's anticompetitive presumption approach.\n\nConcentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors, and consolidation of private payers, such as insurers, and PBMs has negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, our business.\n\nCertain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: McKesson Corporation, Cencora, Inc.

These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics,  dialysis  centers,  hospitals  and  pharmacies.  Similarly,  as  discussed  above,  there  has  been  significant  consolidation  in  the  health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. For example, the six largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers, and nationally account for 94% of prescription drug claims. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities has, and may continue to, put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to ex tract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competing products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations.

Ev en when we successfully innov ate and dev elop new and enhanced products and serv ices, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceiv ed efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achiev e positiv e clinical outcomes, uncertainty ov er third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market serv ices and parts for our products which may detract from our sales.\n\nThe healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, which can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nThe healthcare industry and related industries that we serv e hav e undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, including the following:\n\n- Many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on gov ernment funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and serv ices and research activ ities. The PPACA, healthcare austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and gov ernment austerity measures hav e reduced and may further reduce the amount of gov ernment funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and serv ices and/or the v olume of medical procedures using our products and serv ices. For example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 ('PAMA') introduced a multi-year pricing program for serv ices payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule ('CLFS') that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by priv ate payors. It is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect ov erall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing serv ices, but to the extent our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these serv ices is inadequate, it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains v arious drug price negotiation, inflationary rebate and gov ernment-established pricing prov isions with v arying implementation dates and subjects manufacturers who fail to adhere to the gov ernment's interpretation of the law to penalties. The recent change in U.S. administration may also result in changes that unfav orably impact the healthcare industry and our business.\n- Other countries, as well as some priv ate payors, also control the price of healthcare products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or cov erage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of gov ernmental entities) through compulsory licensing or limiting of intellectual property protections. For example, China has introduced programs designed to lower prices for medical products and reduce healthcare costs (including a v olume-based procurement program) that hav e unfav orably impacted our rev enues and may continue to adv ersely affect our business and financial statements. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adv ersely impact government funding and reimbursement.\n- Governmental and priv ate healthcare prov iders and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the deliv ery of healthcare serv ices, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of v endors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations, strategic alliances and integrated health deliv ery networks and pursuing consolidation to improv e their purchasing lev erage, using competitiv e bid processes to procure healthcare products and serv ices and inv esting in healthcare practices to increase their control ov er healthcare spending. Payors are also seeking to improv e price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increases.\n\nThese changes as well as other impacts from market demand, gov ernment regulations, third-party cov erage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is deliv ered, reimbursed and funded and hav e in the past and could in the future cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serv e to purchase fewer of our products and serv ices, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or serv ices, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding av ailable for our products and serv ices from gov ernmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the v olume of medical procedures that use our products and serv ices, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and ev en if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negativ ely affect our current or future profitability.

Our products compete with other available products based primarily on efficacy, safety, tolerability, acceptance by doctors, ease of patient compliance, ease of use, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, distribution and marketing. A number of companies are pursuing the development of products and technologies that may be competitive with our existing products or research programs. These competing companies include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialized pharmaceutical firms acting either independently or together with other such companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection or may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs. We may be adversely impacted if any of these competitors gain market share as a result of new technologies, commercialization strategies or otherwise.\n\n## Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.\n\nSuccessful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability and amount of third-party payer reimbursement for our products and related treatments and medical services in the markets where we sell our products. As our products mature, pricing pressures from private insurers and government payers often result in a reduction of the net product prices.\n\nLegislative and regulatory actions affecting government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently. We may be adversely impacted by any such legislative and regulatory actions, though it is difficult to predict the impact, if any, on the use and reimbursement of our products.\n\nIn the U.S., the European Union ('EU') and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services. The volume of drug pricing-related legislation has dramatically increased in recent years, including:\n\n- U.S. Congress has enacted laws requiring manufacturer refunds on certain amounts of discarded drug from single-use vials and eliminating the existing cap on Medicaid rebate amounts beginning in 2024.\n- U.S. Congress has enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the 'IRA'), which, among other changes, (1) requires the Department of Health and Human Services to 'negotiate' Medicare prices for certain drugs (starting with 10 drugs in 2026, adding 15 drugs in 2027 and 2028, and adding 20 drugs in 2029 and subsequent years), which could also affect the Medicaid rebate obligations and the ceiling prices charged to covered entities under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act ('340B') if such prices are lower than the Medicaid Best Price; (2) imposes an inflation-based rebate on Medicare Part B utilization starting in 2023 and Part D utilization beginning October 1, 2022; and (3) restructures the Medicare Part D benefit to cap out-of-pocket expenses for Part D beneficiaries  beginning in 2024 and, effective  January 1, 2025, increases  Part  D plans' contributions in the catastrophic coverage phase and increases manufacturers' discount contributions across coverage phases such that manufacturers must pay a 10% discount in the initial coverage phase and a 20% discount in the catastrophic phase on drugs utilized by all Part D beneficiaries, including low income subsidy patients. Although none of our products were selected by the Department of Health and Human Services for 'negotiation' in 2026 or 2027, there is no assurance that our products will not be selected in the future. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the IRA on our business. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ('CMS') has issued a number of guidance documents, but it remains unclear how certain provisions of the IRA will be implemented. Additional guidance, legislation or rulemaking may be issued that could change the scope or implementation of the IRA. In addition, multiple manufacturers and trade organizations have challenged the Medicare 'negotiation' provisions of the IRA, and additional legal challenges may be filed in the future. While the full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain at this time, we anticipate that the IRA will increase our payment obligations under the redesigned Part D discount program, limit the prices we can charge for our products, and increase the rebates we must provide government programs for our products, thereby reducing our profitability and negatively impacting our financial results.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\n## Note 3 - Revenue (Continued)\n\nAbbott recognizes revenue from product sales upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract.  For maintenance agreements that provide service beyond Abbott's standard warranty and other service agreements, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. A time-based measure of progress appropriately reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Payment terms between Abbott and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant.\n\nManagement exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Abbott provides rebates to government agencies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other private entities.\n\nRebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott  regularly  analyzes  the  historical  rebate  trends  and  makes  adjustments  to  reserves  for  changes  in  trends  and  terms  of  rebate  programs.  Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income.\n\nOther allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott's historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant.\n\nAbbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott uses an expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $5.5 billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and approximately $440 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 56 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter.\n\nThese performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above.\n\n## Assets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\n\nAbbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining or renewing contracts with customers are incremental to obtaining the contract. Abbott capitalizes these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from two to ten years. The amounts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not significant.",

At April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, $ 352 million and $314 million was  included  in other  accrued  expenses ,  respectively,  and  $101  million  and  $91  million  was  included  in other  liabilities ,  respectively.  During  the  fiscal  year ended April 26, 2024, the Company recognized $324 million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of April 28, 2023. During the fiscal year ended April 28, 2023, the Company recognized $240 million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue at April 29, 2022.\n\nRemaining performance obligations include goods and services that have not yet been delivered or provided under existing, noncancellable contracts with minimum purchase commitments. At April 26, 2024, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to unsatisfied performance obligations for executed contracts with an original duration of one year or more was approximately $0.5 billion. The Company expects to recognize revenue on the majority of these remaining performance obligations over the next two years.\n\n## 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions\n\n## Acquisition Activity\n\nThe Company had acquisitions during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 that were accounted for as business combinations.  The assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were recorded and consolidated on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. G oodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to future, yet to be defined technologies, new customer relationships, existing workforce of the acquired businesses, and synergies expected to arise after the Company's acquisition of these businesses. The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of income since the date each business was acquired. The results of operations of acquired businesses and the pro forma impact of the acquisitions during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was not significant, either individually or in the aggregate, to the consolidated results of the Company. Purchase price allocation adjustments for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 business combinations were not significant.\n\n## Fiscal Year 2024\n\nThe acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired during the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024 was $335 million. Based on preliminary valuations, assets acquired were primarily comprised of $131 million of goodwill, $150 million of IPR&amp;D, and $29 million of technology-based intangible assets with estimated useful lives of 10 years. For tax  purposes, $51 million of goodwill is deductible while $80 million is not deductible.  The  Company recognized $30  million  of  non-cash  contingent  consideration liabilities  in  connection  with  these  business  combinations  during  the  fiscal  year  ended April  26,  2024,  which  are  comprised  of  revenue  and  product  development milestone-based payments.\n\n## Fiscal Year 2023\n\n## Intersect ENT\n\nOn May 13, 2022, the Company acquired Intersect ENT, a global ear, nose, and throat (ENT) medical technology leader. The acquisition expands the Neuroscience segment portfolio of products used during ENT procedures, and combined with the Company's navigation, powered instruments, and existing tissue health products, offers a broader suite of solutions to assist surgeons treating patients who suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Total consideration, net of cash acquired, for the transaction, in which the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Intersect ENT for $28.25 per share, was $1.2 billion consisting of $1.1 billion of cash and $98 million previously held investments in  Intersect  ENT.  The  Company acquired $615  million  of  goodwill,  $635  million  of  technology-based  intangible  assets,  $35  million  of customer-related intangible assets, and $13 million of tradenames with estimated useful lives of 20 years. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Revenue and net loss attributable to Intersect ENT since the date of acquisition as well as costs incurred in connection with the acquisition included in the consolidated statements of income were not significant for fiscal year 2023.\n\n## Affera, Inc.\n\nOn August 30, 2022, the Company acquired Affera, Inc. (Affera) a privately-held company focused on the development of cardiac mapping and navigation systems and catheter-based  cardiac  ablation  technologies.  The  acquisition  ex pands  the  Cardiovascular  segment  suite  of  advanced  cardiac  ablation  products  and  accessories, including its first cardiac mapping and navigation platform. Total consideration, net of cash acquired for the transaction, was $904 million. The Company acquired $660 million of goodwill and $300 million of IPR&amp;D, which was capitalized into intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. The goodwill is not deductible for tax  purposes. The Company recognized $201 million of non-cash contingent consideration liabilities in connection with the acquisition, which are comprised of product development milestone-based payments. Revenue and net loss attributable to Affera since the date of acquisition as well as costs incurred in connection with the acquisition included in the consolidated statements of income were not significant for fiscal year 2023.",

      "question": "How do Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Medtronic each incorporate regulatory milestones into their financial planning and valuation models, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to managing regulatory risk in drug and device development?",
      "answer": "Amgen uses regulatory milestones as key inputs in the valuation of contingent consideration obligations and intangible assets, particularly in the context of acquisitions. They apply discounted cash flow models that factor in the probability and timing of FDA and other regulatory approvals, which directly affects the fair value of these obligations. Bristol-Myers Squibb incorporates regulatory milestones as performance-based triggers in alliance agreements, which influence payments and revenue sharing with partners. These milestones are part of a broader framework of alliance management that affects how BMS shares risk and reward in drug development. Medtronic, in contrast, ties regulatory milestones to contingent consideration receivables, particularly in the context of divestitures such as the sale of its RCS business. The company records the fair value of these contingent payments as assets, with values fluctuating based on the likelihood of achieving those milestones. Collectively, this shows that while all three companies rely on regulatory milestones, Amgen focuses on internal valuation impacts, BMY emphasizes external partnership dynamics, and Medtronic centers on post-divestiture performance-linked compensation.",

        "Hop 1: AMGN \u2192 Regulatory Milestones: Amgen incorporates regulatory milestones into discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and intangible assets, particularly in acquisitions, with significant emphasis on FDA approval timing and probability.",
        "Hop 2: BMY \u2192 Regulatory Milestones: Bristol-Myers Squibb includes regulatory milestones as performance triggers in alliance agreements, which influence payments and profit sharing with development and commercialization partners, reflecting a collaborative risk-sharing model.",
        "Hop 3: MDT \u2192 Regulatory Milestones: Medtronic ties regulatory milestones to contingent consideration receivables following the sale of its RCS business, with potential payouts dependent on future regulatory achievements, and records these as fair-valued assets on the balance sheet."

      "answer": "Amgen discloses that it pays significant double-digit royalties to Kyowa Kirin on global sales (excluding Japan) as part of a collaboration, and also mentions potential future royalty obligations tied to product approvals. Johnson & Johnson categorizes royalty-related payments in its financial statements, showing that royalties paid to partners are recorded under 'Cost of products sold,' while royalties received are classified under 'Other income (expense), net.' Pfizer indicates that it earns royalties from collaboration partners, specifically noting that these are a component of its alliance revenue, which decreased in 2023 primarily due to lower Comirnaty sales. Together, these disclosures reveal that while all three companies engage in royalty arrangements through collaborations, they differ in how they structure and report these payments, with Amgen emphasizing future contingent liabilities, JNJ providing a clear categorization framework, and Pfizer focusing on realized royalty income.",

      "answer": "Amgen uses a multi-period excess earnings income approach to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, such as the TEPEZZA asset acquired from Horizon, with sensitivity to assumptions like revenue projections and discount rates. Danaher applies a variety of valuation methods including discounted cash flows, market multiples, and third-party appraisals for its venture and private investments, acknowledging that different methodologies could yield materially different fair value estimates. Gilead utilizes a probability-weighted income approach with Level 3 fair value inputs, particularly for IPR&D assets like Trodelvy, where changes in assumptions around clinical outcomes and competitive dynamics can significantly impact fair value estimates and result in impairment charges. Together, these approaches highlight varying degrees of exposure to market volatility, clinical risk, and strategic decision-making in valuing intangible assets.",

          "chunk_text": "| Description of the Matter                | As described in Note 3 to the financial statements, on October 6, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc ('Horizon') ('Horizon acquisition'). The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition date fair values of acquired intangible assets, primarily consisted of finite-lived developed-product- technology rights, inclusive of the TEPEZZA intangible asset. The finite-lived intangible assets were valued using a multi-period excess earnings income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value. Auditing the acquisition date fair values of the TEPEZZA finite-lived developed-product-technology rights intangible asset acquired from Horizon was complex due to the significant judgment required in estimating the fair value. In particular, the fair value estimate required the use of a valuation methodology that was sensitive to changes in significant assumptions (e.g., revenue projections and discount rate), which were affected by expected future market or economic conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over the determination of the estimated fair value of the intangible assets. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the valuation methodologies and the significant assumptions used to develop the fair value estimate of the TEPEZZA intangible asset. We also tested management's controls to validate that the data used in the fair value estimate was complete and accurate. To test the Company's estimated fair value of the TEPEZZA intangible asset, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology and the significant assumptions, with the assistance of a valuation specialist. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data utilized in the valuation. For example, we compared the TEPEZZA revenue projections to analyst reports, current industry and market trends, historical results of the acquired business and to other relevant factors. We also performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the impact that changes in significant assumptions would have on the fair value of the TEPEZZA acquired intangible asset. In addition, we tested the estimated discount rate applied to the TEPEZZA intangible asset value. |\n",

      "question": "How do Amgen, Eli Lilly, and Merck each quantify or characterize their financial exposure to Medicaid rebate obligations, and what does this reveal about their differing risk profiles in the U.S. pharmaceutical pricing environment?",
      "answer": "Amgen notes that Medicaid rebates are a key metric in determining drug pricing and rebate obligations, and highlights that seven U.S. states have enacted laws establishing Prescription Drug Affordability Boards (PDABs) that could set upper payment limits on certain drugs. Eli Lilly states that it is required to provide a minimum Medicaid rebate of 23.1% plus adjustments for price increases above the consumer price index, and warns that changes to Medicaid rebate calculations could materially impact its revenue. Merck specifically notes that beginning in 2024, the elimination of the Medicaid rebate cap means manufacturers may pay more than 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) in rebates, presenting a significant risk for drugs with high Medicaid utilization. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies face Medicaid rebate pressures, Merck faces a newly heightened exposure due to the rebate cap removal, Eli Lilly emphasizes structural rebate obligations and sensitivity to program changes, and Amgen highlights the growing influence of state-level pricing controls that compound federal rebate pressures.",

      "question": "How do Abbott, Amgen, and CVS each treat or reflect the impact of intangible asset amortization in their 2023 financial reporting, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to post-acquisition financial management?",
      "answer": "Abbott does not allocate intangible asset amortization to its operating segments, keeping it separate in corporate-level reporting. Amgen records $479 million of intangible asset amortization related to its Horizon acquisition, directly reflecting it in cost of sales. CVS discloses $106 million of intangible asset amortization tied to its acquisition of Signify Health, which is included in its consolidated operating results. This reveals differing levels of transparency and integration of amortization impacts, with Amgen and CVS incorporating the expense directly into operating performance metrics, while Abbott isolates it from segment reporting.",

        "Hop 1: ABT \u2192 Intangible Asset Amortization: Abbott explicitly states that intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are excluded from segment asset measures.",

      "answer": "CVS faces potential damages from PBM-related litigation and investigations, including a multi-district case and an FTC administrative complaint alleging anti-competitive practices in insulin pricing. Pfizer is exposed to patent-related damages suits in various jurisdictions, particularly concerning products like Abrysvo, Comirnaty, and Paxlovid, with risks of enhanced damages if willful infringement is found. UnitedHealth faces potential damages from government investigations and audits, particularly related to Medicare risk adjustment data validation and PBM practices, which could lead to civil penalties or corporate integrity agreements.

The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings, however, do sometimes occur, which could result in judgments against the Company, entry into settlements or a revision to its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions including possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or exclusion from participating in government programs. The outcome of such governmental investigations of proceedings could be material to the Company.\n\n## Usual and Customary Pricing Litigation\n\nThe Company is named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Company's retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process. These actions are brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs, including plan members, private payors and government payors, and are based on different legal theories. Some of these cases are brought as putative class actions, and in some instances, classes have been certified. The Company is defending itself against these claims.\n\n## PBM Litigation and Investigations\n\nThe Company is named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is subject to a number of investigations concerning its PBM practices.\n\nThe Company is facing multiple lawsuits, including by the FTC, state Attorneys General, governmental subdivisions, private parties and several putative class actions, regarding drug pricing and its rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers. These complaints, brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs under a variety of legal theories, generally allege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products. The majority of these cases have now been transferred into a multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company is defending itself against these claims. The Company has also received subpoenas, civil investigative demands ('CIDs'), and other requests for documents and information from, and is being investigated by, the DOJ, the HHS, the FTC and Attorneys General of several states and the District of Columbia regarding its PBM practices, including pharmacy contracting practices and reimbursement, pricing and rebates. While the FTC has released a number of interim staff reports related to its studies of PBM practices under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, which allows the FTC to conduct studies, among other activities, it has not yet released a final report. The Company has been providing documents and information in response to these subpoenas, CIDs, and requests for information. In September 2024, the FTC filed an administrative complaint against the three largest PBMs (the 'PBM Group') and their affiliated group purchasing organizations, including subsidiaries of the Company. The complaint alleged that the PBM Group and their affiliated group purchasing organizations engaged in anti-competitive and unfair practices that 'artificially' increased insulin costs. The Company is aggressively defending itself against the complaint. In November 2024, the PBM Group filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri challenging the constitutionality of the FTC's administrative complaint.\n\nUnited States ex rel. Behnke v. CVS Caremark Corporation, et al. (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). In April 2018, the Court unsealed a complaint filed in February 2014. The government has declined to intervene in this case. The relator alleges that the Company submitted, or caused to be submitted, to Part D of the Medicare program Prescription Drug Event data and/or Direct and Indirect Remuneration reports that misrepresented true prices paid by the Company's PBM to pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Part D beneficiaries with prescription benefits administered by the Company's PBM. The Company is defending itself against these claims.\n\n## Controlled Substances Litigation, Audits and Subpoenas\n\nForty-five states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories are participating in a settlement resolving substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by participating states and political subdivisions but not private plaintiffs. A high percentage of eligible subdivisions within the participating states also have elected to join the settlement. The settlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com.

W e rely and expect to continue to rely on a com bination of intellectual property, including patent, tradem ark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and dom ain nam e protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreem ents, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. I f we fail to obtain and m aintain adequate intellectual property protection, we m ay not be able to prevent third parties from  launching generic or biosim ilar versions of our branded products, from  using our proprietary technologies or from  m arketing products that are very sim ilar or identical to ours. O ur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a tim ely basis. Sim ilarly, any term  extensions that we seek m ay not be granted on a tim ely basis, if at all, and any term  adjustm ents related to patent office delays in obtaining a patent m ay be reduced or elim inated entirely due to risks associated with changes in law relating to patent term s. In addition, our issued patents m ay not contain claim s sufficiently broad to protect us against claim s regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term  m ade by parties with sim ilar technologies or products or provide us with any com petitive advantage, including patent-based exclusivity in a particular technology or product area.\n\nFurther, legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governm ents could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from  enforcing intellectual property related to our products. F or exam ple, the W T O 's June 2022 M inisterial D ecision on the Agreem ent on T rade-R elated Aspects of I ntellectual P roperty R ights seeks to m ake it easier for certain W T O  m em bers to issue a com pulsory license on C O VID -19 vaccines.\n\nThe scope of our patent claim s also m ay vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country, its enforcem ent practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country's intellectual property fram ework (e.g., laws or regulations that prom ote or provide broad discretion to issue a com pulsory license). In countries that provide som e form  of regulatory exclusivity, m echanism s exist perm itting som e form  of challenge to our patents by com petitors or generic drug m arketers prior to or im m ediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic com panies are employing aggressive strategies, such as 'at-risk' launches that challenge our patent rights. M ost of the suits involve claim s by generic drug m anufacturers that patents covering our products, uses, processes or dosage form s are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosim ilar drug m anufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attem pts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair com petition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claim s m ay also be brought as counterclaim s to actions we bring to enforce our patents. W e are also party to other patent dam ages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payors, governm ents or other parties are seeking dam ages from  us for alleged delay of generic entry. W e also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-exam ination or opposition proceedings, before the U .S. P atent and T radem ark O ffice, the E uropean P atent O ffice, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents or a com petitors' patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosim ilar products could be introduced into the m arket resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. F or additional inform ation, including inform ation regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16A1 . F urther, if we are unable to m aintain our existing license agreem ents or other agreem ents pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold tradem ark registrations and have tradem ark applications pending in m any jurisdictions, any of which m ay be the subject of a governm ental or third-party objection, which could prevent the m aintenance or issuance of the tradem ark. As our products m ature, our reliance on our tradem arks and trade dress to differentiate us from  our com petitors increases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from  adopting, registering or using tradem arks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. W e seek to protect our proprietary inform ation, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our em ployees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary inform ation and confidentiality agreem ents upon the com m encem ent of their relationship with us. D espite these efforts and precautions, we m ay be unable to prevent a third-party from  copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal rem edies m ay not adequately com pensate us for the dam ages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others m ay independently and lawfully develop substantially sim ilar or identical products that circum vent our intellectual property by m eans of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\n\n## THIRD-PARTY INTE LLE CTU AL PR OPE R TY CLAIMS\n\nA properly functioning intellectual property regim e is essential to our business m odel. W e are com m itted to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other com panies, but the patent granting process is im perfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities m ay require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were im properly granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges m ay not always be successful.\n\nPart of our business depends upon identifying biosim ilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which m ay involve litigation, associated costs and tim e delays, and m ay ultim ately not be successful. T hese opportunities m ay arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In som e circum stances we m ay take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a 'first-to-m arket' or early m arket position for our products.\n\nThird parties m ay claim  that our products infringe one or m ore patents owned or controlled by them . C laim s of intellectual property infringem ent can be costly and tim e-consum ing to resolve, m ay delay or prevent product launches, and m ay result in significant royalty paym ents or dam ages or potential licensing agreem ents. F or exam ple, our R &amp;D  in a therapeutic area m ay not be first and another com pany or entity m ay have obtained relevant patents before us. W e are involved in patent-related disputes with third parties over our attem pts to market pharm aceutical products, including related to Abrysvo, C om irnaty and P axlovid. As we expand our m R N A portfolio, patent-related disputes m ay increase. O nce we have final regulatory approval of the related products, we m ay decide to com m ercially m arket these products even though associated legal proceedings (including any appeals) have not been resolved (i.e., 'at-risk' launch). I f one of our m arketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-prom otion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party m ay be awarded significant dam ages or royalty paym ents, or we m ay be prevented from  further sales of that product. Such dam ages m ay be enhanced as m uch as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n21",

CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Some of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which in the past have resulted and in future periods could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS.\n\nWe have been and in the future may become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Such investigations, audits, reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers regarding, among other allegations, claims that we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Government investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which have resulted and in future periods could result in adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\n## Our pharmacy care services businesses face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses.\n\nWe provide pharmacy care services through our Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Further, various governmental agencies have conducted and continue to conduct investigations and studies into certain PBM practices, which have resulted and in future periods may result in PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements, or could materially and adversely impact the PBM business model. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, Optum Rx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards. Optum Rx conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and Drug Administration and Boards of Pharmacy.\n\nWe could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, as well as claims related to the inherent risks in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert that fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine such fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into prohibited transactions.\n\n## If we fail to comply w ith applicable priv acy, security, technology and data law s, regulations and standards, including w ith respect to third-party serv ice prov iders utilizing protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and addressed in requirements of our customer contracts. Additionally, legislative and regulatory action in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, as well as internationally, is emerging in the areas of AI/ML and automation. These laws, regulations and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy, security, technology and data laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations.\n\nInternationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, information security, and AI/ML and automation in the European Union, UK, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers.",

      "answer": "AMGN reports a 'Less: Imputed Interest' of $161 million against total lease payments of $941 million, reducing its lease liabilities to $780 million. BMY shows a larger imputed interest deduction of $370 million from total lease payments of $1,921 million, resulting in a lease liability of $1,551 million. TMO, on the other hand, deducts $357 million in imputed interest from $1,858 million in total lease payments, yielding a lease liability of $1,501 million. This comparison suggests that BMY and TMO have significantly larger lease obligations than AMGN, with BMY bearing the highest imputed interest cost, potentially reflecting longer-term or higher-cost lease arrangements. TMO's imputed interest is nearly equal to BMY\u2019s despite lower total lease payments, indicating a higher proportion of interest relative to lease value, possibly due to different lease terms or credit profiles.",

The estimated fair value of both definite-lived Acquired marketed product rights and indefinite-lived IPRD assets was determined using an income approach valuation method. Goodwill resulted primarily from the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe results of operations and cash flows for Karuna, RayzeBio and Mirati were included in the consolidated financial statements commencing on their respective acquisition dates and were not material. Historical financial results of the acquired entities were not significant.\n\n## Orum\n\nIn 2023, BMS acquired the rights to Orum's ORM-6151 program, which is currently in Phase I clinical development. ORM-6151 is an anti-CD33 antibody-enabled GSPT1 degrader for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. The consideration included an upfront payment of $100 million, as well as contingent development milestone payments up to $80 million. The upfront payment was expensed to Acquired IPRD.\n\n## Turning Point\n\nIn 2022, BMS acquired Turning Point for $4.1 billion of cash or $3.3 billion net of cash acquired. Turning Point was a clinical-stage precision oncology company with a pipeline of investigational medicines designed to target the common mutations and alterations that drive cancer growth. The acquisition provided BMS rights to Turning Point's lead asset, repotrectinib, and other clinical and pre-clinical stage assets. Repotrectinib was approved by the FDA in November 2023 and is marketed under the brand name Augtyro.\n\nThe transaction was accounted for as a business combination in which all assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.\n\nThe results of Turning Point's operations were included in the consolidated financial statements commencing August 18, 2022, and were not material.

          "chunk_text": "## Arcellx\n\nIn January 2023, we closed an agreement to enter into a global strategic collaboration with Arcellx, a public company, to co-develop and co-commercialize Arcellx's lead late-stage product candidate, CART-ddBCMA, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and potential future nextgeneration  autologous  and  non-autologous  products.  In  December  2023,  we  amended  the  agreement  and  expanded  the  scope  of  the  collaboration  to  include lymphomas and exercised our option to negotiate a license for Arcellx's ARC-SparX program, ACLX-001, in multiple myeloma. In conjunction with the collaboration, we recorded a combined $313 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2023, primarily related to upfront payments. We also recorded a combined equity investment of $299 million. Our equity investment is subject to lock-up provisions until June 2025 and is included in Prepaid and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024. The companies will share development, clinical  trial  and  commercialization  costs  for  CART-ddBCMA  and  will  jointly  commercialize  the  product  and  split  U.S.  profits 50/50.  Outside  the  U.S.,  we  will commercialize  the  product  and Arcellx  will  receive  royalties  on  sales.  Under  the  agreement, Arcellx   is  eligible  to  receive  performance-based  development  and regulatory milestone payments of up to $1.5 billion related to CART-ddBCMA, a potential future next-generation autologous product and a potential future nonautologous product, with further commercial milestone payments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of worldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-promote the future products. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid $68 million for development milestones met, which was charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If additional future products are developed, Arcellx would be eligible to receive additional milestone payments, profit split payments on co-promoted products and royalties on at least a portion of worldwide net sales, depending on whether Arcellx opts in to co-promote these additional future products as well.\n\n## Dragonfly\n\nIn April  2022,  we  entered  into  a  strategic  research  collaboration  agreement  (the  'Dragonfly  Collaboration Agreement')  with  Dragonfly  Therapeutics,  Inc. ('Dragonfly') to develop natural killer ('NK') cell engager-based immunotherapies for oncology and inflammation indications. Under the terms of the Dragonfly Collaboration Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide license from Dragonfly for the 5T4-targeting investigational immunotherapy program, DF7001, as well as  options,  after  the  completion  of  certain  preclinical  activities,  to  license  ex clusive,  worldwide  rights  to  develop  and  commercialize  additional  NK  cell  engager programs using the  Dragonfly  Tri-specific  NK  Engager  platform.  Upon  the  closing  of  the  Dragonfly  Collaboration Agreement,  we  made  a  $300  million  upfront payment to Dragonfly, and we made an additional $15 million payment related to a target selection in connection with an August 2022 amendment to the agreement, which were recorded in Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. In July 2023, we mutually agreed to terminate the DF7001 program. If we exercise our options on additional NK cell engager programs, Dragonfly would be eligible to receive opt-in payments and performance-based development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties on worldwide net sales on these optioned programs.\n\n## Merck\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. ('Merck') to jointly develop  and  commercialize  long-acting  investigational  treatments  in  HIV   that  combine  G ilead's  investigational  capsid  inhibitor,  lenacapavir,  and  Merck's investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as mutually agreed. The collaboration is initially focused on long-acting oral and injectable formulations.\n\nUnder  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  as  amended,  G ilead  and  Merck  will  mostly  share  global  development  and  commercialization  costs  at 60%  and 40%, respectively, across the oral and injectable formulation programs. For long-acting oral products, if approved, G ilead would lead commercialization in the U.S., and Merck would lead  commercialization  in  the  European  Union  ('EU')  and  rest  of  the  world.  For  long-acting  injectable  products,  if  approved,  Merck  would  lead commercialization in the U.S. and G ilead would lead commercialization in the EU and rest of the world. Under the terms of the agreement, G ilead and Merck would jointly promote the combination products in the U.S. and certain other major markets. If successful, we would share global product revenues with Merck equally until product revenues surpass certain pre-determined per formulation revenue tiers. Upon passing $2.0 billion in net product sales for the oral combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue would increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Upon passing $3.5 billion in net product sales for the injectable combination in a given calendar year, our share of revenue will increase to 65% for any revenues above the threshold for such calendar year. Reimbursements of R&amp;D costs to or from Merck are recorded within Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Expenses recognized under the agreement were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. No revenues have been recognized under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

M ilestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense when the milestone event occurs.\n\nThe fiscal year 2024 asset acquisitions expensed as research and development included V-Wave Ltd. and the global rights to the NM 26 bispecific antibody (Yellow Jersey acquisition). The remaining activity was not material.\n\nOn October 8, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of V-Wave Ltd, a privately-held company focused on developing innovative treatment options for patients with heart failure, for an upfront payment of $0.6 billion, with the potential for additional regulatory and commercial milestone payments up to approximately $1.1 billion. The Company recorded an IPR&amp;D charge of approximately $0.5 billion, net of a gain recorded on the Company's existing investment in V-Wave and the results of operations are included in the M edTech segment as of the acquisition date.\n\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Y ellow Jersey, a demerged subsidiary of Numab Therapeutics A G, to secure the global rights to NM26, a novel, investigational first-in-class bispecific antibody targeting two clinically proven pathways in atopic dermatitis (A D), in an all-cash transaction for approximately $1.25 billion. The Company recorded an IPR&amp;D charge of approximately $1.25 billion, and the results of operations are included in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date.\n\nThe fiscal year 2023 asset acquisitions expensed as research and development included Laminar Inc. The remaining activity was not material.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Laminar Inc., a privately-held medical device company focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (A Fib), for an upfront payment of $0.4 billion. The Company recorded an IPR&amp;D charge of approximately $0.4 billion and the results of operations are included in the M edTech segment as of the acquisition date.\n\nThere were no significant asset acquisitions in 2022.\n\n## Divestitures\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of A cclarent resulting in approximately $0.3 billion in proceeds and the divestiture of Ponvory outside of the U.S. resulting in approximately $0.2 billion in proceeds. A ll other divestitures were not material.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company executed divestitures resulting in approximately $0.2 billion in proceeds resulting in gains or losses that were not material. A t fiscal y ear end 2023, the Company held assets, primarily intangibles, on its Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $0.3 billion, primarily related to A cclarent and Ponvory, that were subsequently divested in fiscal 2024.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures.\n\n## 19. Legal proceedings\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\n\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. A s of December 29, 2024, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n93",

Medtronic (MDT) takes a more traditional approach, focusing on historical experience and customer-specific information to assess credit risk, with uncollectible accounts written off when deemed uncollectible. Amgen (AMGN), however, notes that its Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is not material and reveals a high customer concentration, with three customers accounting for 70% of net trade receivables in 2024, including a 26% exposure to international markets, primarily Europe. This suggests that while ABT and MDT take a more risk-aware, analytical approach to credit management, AMGN's low allowance may reflect either strong creditworthiness of its concentrated customer base or a more conservative revenue recognition policy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Medtronic plc\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNature of Operations Medtronic plc (Medtronic or the Company) is the leading global healthcare technology company- alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. The Company provides innovative products and therapies to serve healthcare systems, physicians, clinicians, and patients. Medtronic was founded in 1949 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Medtronic plc, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest, and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances have been fully eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year. Amounts reported in millions within this annual report are computed based on the amounts in thousands, and therefore, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Additionally, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding.\n\nUse of E stimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used when accounting for items such as income taxes, contingencies, goodwill, intangible asset, equity investment, and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\n\nFiscal Year-E nd The Company utilizes a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending the last Friday in April, for the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 and for each of the three fiscal years ended April 26, 2024 (fiscal year 2024), April 28, 2023 (fiscal year 2023), and April 29, 2022 (fiscal year 2022).\n\nCash Equivalents The Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\nInvestments The Company invests in marketable debt and equity securities, investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option, investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, and investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nMarketable debt securities are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These investments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value for available-for-sale securities is recorded, net of tax es, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets.  The  Company  determines  the  appropriate  classification  of  its  investments  in  marketable  debt  securities  at  the  time  of  purchase  and  reevaluates  such determinations at each balance sheet date. The classification of marketable debt securities as current or long-term is based on the nature of the securities and the availability for use in current operations consistent with the Company's management of its capital structure and liquidity.\n\nCertain of the Company's investments in marketable equity securities and other securities are long-term, strategic investments in companies that are in various stages of development and are primarily included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value of marketable equity securities is recognized within other non-operating income, net in the consolidated statements of income. At each reporting period, the Company makes a qualitative assessment considering impairment indicators to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Equity method investments  for  which  the  Company  has  elected  the  fair  value  option  are  valued  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  methodology,  taking  into  consideration  various assumptions including discount rate and all pertinent financial information available related to the investees, including the timing of anticipated product launches, historical  financial  results,  and  projections  of  future  cash  flows.  Equity  investments  that  do  not  have  readily  determinable  fair  values  are  measured  using  the measurement alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Equity securities accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at the amount of the Company's investment and are adjusted each period for the Company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid. Securities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest other than temporary impairment has occurred.\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses The Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses. When evaluating allowances for doubtful accounts, the Company considers various factors, including historical  ex perience  and  customer-specific information.  Uncollectible accounts are written-off against the allowance when it is deemed that a customer account is uncollectible.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company reduces the carrying value of inventories for items that are potentially excess, obsolete, or slow-moving based on changes in customer demand, technology developments, or other economic factors.",

      "answer": "AbbVie highlights that the potential loss of patent protection for key products like Humira, which accounted for 37% of its 2021 revenues, poses a significant risk to its future revenues. The company faces challenges from generic drug manufacturers and biosimilars, and any major decline in Humira sales could materially impact its financial performance. Eli Lilly identifies pricing pressures and restrictive reimbursement policies from both public and private payers as key threats to its future revenues, particularly in light of proposed legislation that could allow government negotiation of drug prices, including for insulin, which is a major product line. Merck, in contrast, emphasizes collaborative ventures\u2014such as its joint development and revenue-sharing agreement with Gilead for long-acting HIV treatments\u2014as a strategic lever for future revenue growth. Under the agreement, Merck shares development costs and revenues with Gilead, with potential adjustments in revenue splits based on sales thresholds.

          "chunk_text": "## AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings.\n\nThird parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nAlthough most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.\n\nAbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced.\n\n## A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition.\n\nThird parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.\n\n## Any significant event that adversely affects Humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows.\n\nHumira accounted for approximately 37% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2021. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for Humira (as described further in 'The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings ' above), the commercialization of biosimilars of Humira, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of Humira for any reason.\n\n## AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline.\n\nTo remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care,",

          "chunk_text": "products and indications and the very long lead times necessary for the expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity from time to time result in difficulty meeting demand for, or disruptions, shortages, and higher costs in the supply of, our products. See Item 1, \"Business - Raw Materials and Product Supply,\" for more details.\n\n- Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe rely on third parties, including suppliers, distributors, alliances, and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product and clinical development, manufacturing, commercialization, hosting of, and support for, information technology systems, product distribution, and certain financial transactional processes. As examples, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of some of our clinical trials to contract research organizations and the distribution of our products through logistics providers. Outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements; may not produce reliable results; may not perform in a timely manner; may not maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of confidential and proprietary information relating to us, our clinical trial subjects, or patients; may experience disruption or fail to perform due to information technology system vulnerabilities, breaches, cyber-attacks, or inadequate controls or procedures; may be unable to satisfy their commitments to us in which case we may not be able to achieve acceptable alternative sourcing; or may fail to perform at all. The foregoing risks may be heightened in jurisdictions outside the U.S., where we may face additional costs, uncertainties, and risks. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, privacy, security, or other obligations to us, our clinical trial subjects, and our patients could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Government Regulation\n\n- Our business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business.\n\nPublic and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and reimbursement for, and patient access to, our medicines. These pressures could continue to negatively affect our future revenues and net income. Governments and private payers worldwide have intensified their scrutiny of, and actions intended to address, pricing, reimbursement, and access to pharmaceutical products. Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including as a result of the regulatory priorities of the current U.S. presidential administration and other regulatory authorities worldwide, could adversely impact our business and revenue. For example, pending legislation in the U.S. could result in government negotiation of the price of some of our medicines, including insulin. Furthermore, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, or private payers, such as the recently proposed Alzheimer's Monoclonal Antibody NCD, may adversely impact our business and financial results. However, we cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of current and future health care reform efforts. We also may continue to experience potential additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems around the world.\n\nFor more details, see Item 1, \"Business - Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access,\" Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access,\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16: Contingencies.\"\n\n- Changes in foreign currency rates, interest rate risks, or inflation could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nAs a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, interest rate risk from our exposure to floating and variable interest rates, and inflation risk from existing and expected rates of inflation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates, interest rates, and inflation can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets related to sotatercept and Reblozyl were determined using an income approach, specifically the multi-period  excess  earnings  method.  The  future  probability-weighted  net  cash  flows  were  discounted  to  present  value  utilizing  a  discount  rate  of  7.5%  for sotatercept and 6.0% for Reblozyl . Actual cash flows are likely to be different than those assumed. (1)\n\nThe goodwill recognized is largely attributable to anticipated synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and was allocated to the Pharmaceutical segment. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. (2)\n\nIn  April  2021,  Merck  acquired  Pandion  Therapeutics,  Inc.  (Pandion),  a  clinical-stage  biotechnology  company developing  novel  therapeutics  designed  to  address  the  unmet  needs  of  patients  living  with  autoimmune  diseases.  Pandion  is advancing a pipeline of precision immune modulators targeting critical immune control nodes. Total consideration paid of $1.9 billion  included  $147  million  of  costs  primarily  comprised  of  share-based  compensation  payments  to  settle  equity  awards. The transaction  was  accounted  for  as  an  acquisition  of  an  asset.  Merck  recorded  net  assets  of  $156  million  (primarily  cash)  and Research and development expenses of $1.7 billion in 2021 related to the transaction. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition.\n\nIn  March  2021,  Merck  and  Gilead  Sciences,  Inc.  (Gilead)  entered  into  an  agreement  to  jointly  develop  and commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV that combine Merck's investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir, and Gilead's investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir. The collaboration will initially focus on long-acting oral formulations and long-acting injectable formulations of these combination products, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as mutually agreed. There was no upfront payment made by either party upon entering into the agreement.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Merck and Gilead will share operational responsibilities, as well as development, commercialization and marketing costs, and any future revenues. Global development and commercialization costs will be shared 60% Gilead and 40% Merck across the oral and injectable formulation programs. For long-acting oral products, Gilead will lead commercialization  in  the  U.S.  and  Merck  will  lead  commercialization  in  the  EU  and  the  rest  of  the  world.  For  long-acting injectable products, Merck will lead commercialization in the U.S. and Gilead will lead commercialization in the EU and the rest of the  world.  Gilead  and  Merck will co-promote in the U.S. and certain other major markets. Merck and Gilead will share global product revenues equally until product revenues surpass certain pre-agreed per formulation revenue tiers. Upon passing $2.0 billion a year in net product sales for the oral combination, the revenue split will adjust to 65% Gilead and 35% Merck for any revenues above the threshold. Upon passing $3.5 billion a year in net product sales for the injectable combination, the revenue split will adjust to 65% Gilead and 35% Merck for any revenues above the threshold.\n\nBeyond  the  potential  combinations  of  investigational  lenacapavir  and  investigational  islatravir,  Gilead  will  have  the option  to  license  certain  of  Merck's  investigational  oral  integrase  inhibitors  to  develop  in  combination  with  lenacapavir. Reciprocally,  Merck  will  have  the  option  to  license  certain  of  Gilead's  investigational  oral  integrase  inhibitors  to  develop  in combination  with  islatravir.  Each  company  may  exercise  its  option  for  an  investigational  oral  integrase  inhibitor  of  the  other company  following  completion  of  the  first  Phase  1  clinical  trial  of  that  integrase  inhibitor.  Upon  exercise  of  an  option,  the companies will split development costs and revenues, unless the non-exercising company decides to opt-out.\n\nIn December 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed full or partial clinical holds on investigational new drug applications for certain oral, implant and injectable formulations of islatravir based on",

      "answer": "CVS highlights that integration of recent acquisitions like Oak Street Health and Signify Health is complex, expensive, and time-consuming, with risks including operational inefficiencies, distraction of management, and failure to realize anticipated synergies. DHR emphasizes that integration of acquisitions can lead to financial volatility, including pre- and post-closing charges, assumed liabilities, and challenges in achieving expected cost savings or synergies, with additional risks from regulatory scrutiny and competitive bidding. PFE quantifies integration and acquisition-related costs at $614 million pre-tax, including inventory adjustments, amortization, and depreciation expenses tied to the Seagen acquisition, indicating a measurable short-term financial impact. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face integration challenges, CVS and DHR emphasize strategic and operational risks, whereas PFE provides concrete financial figures that illustrate the immediate cost burden of integration.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2024 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2025. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2025 by $109 million.\n\nThe health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2024 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2025.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional i nformation. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a l ower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.\n\n## Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset.

There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company's estimate of IBNR in 2024.\n\nThe Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to estimate 'completion factors.' The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all claims are paid within six  months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid. These historically-derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents the Company's estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company's health care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser ex tent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership and changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using the Company's completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.\n\nBecause claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derived completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarial judgment and places a greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced by seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix.\n\nThe Company's health care cost trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such services. Many factors influence the health care cost trend rate, including the Company's ability to manage benefit costs through product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs, as well as the mix of the Company's business. The health status of the Company's Insured members, aging of the population and other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per member utilization and unit costs. Changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies, increases in the cost of prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs), direct-toconsumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies, clusters of high-cost cases, claim intensity, changes in the regulatory environment, health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors also contribute to the cost of health care and the Company's health care cost trend rate.\n\nFor each reporting period, the Company uses an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating its health care costs payable. As a result, considerable variability and uncertainty is inherent in such estimates, particularly with respect to claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date; and the adequacy of such estimates is highly sensitive to changes in assumed completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rates. For each reporting period the Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable considering the potential volatility in assumed completion factors and health care cost trend rates, as well as other factors. The Company believes its estimate of health care costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover its obligations at December 31, 2024; however, actual claim payments may differ from the Company's estimates. A worsening (or improvement) of the Company's health care cost trend rates or changes in completion factors from those that the Company assumed in estimating health care costs payable at December 31, 2024 would cause these estimates to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.\n\nEach quarter, the Company re-examines previously established health care costs payable estimates based on actual claim payments for prior periods and other changes in facts and circumstances. Given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate, it is possible that the Company's estimates of health care costs payable could develop either favorably (that is, its actual health care costs for the period were less than estimated) or unfavorably. The changes in the Company's estimate of health care costs payable may relate to a prior quarter, prior year or earlier periods. For a roll forward of the Company's health care costs payable, see Note 8 ''Health Care Costs Payable.'' The Company's reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of its ultimate liability for health care costs payable.",

We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in dev elopment and enter into research and dev elopment arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future ev ents linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achiev ement of an important point in the dev elopment life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approv al for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achiev ement of certain sales lev els). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the ev ent that regulatory approv al for marketing is obtained.\n\nIndiv idually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period.

Some of those judgments can be subjectiv e and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates.

We believ e that, giv en current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adv erse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates hav e been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\n\n## Background and Uncertainties\n\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product rev enue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, prov isions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on rev enue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\n\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receiv e under these types of contracts.",

      "question": "How do Abbott, Gilead, and Merck each account for contingent milestone payments in their research and development strategies, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to external innovation partnerships?",
      "answer": "Abbott expenses milestone payments when the milestone results are achieved, reflecting a policy of recognizing R&D obligations only upon achievement of defined outcomes. Gilead records upfront and pre-commercialization milestone payments related to collaborations as acquired in-process R&D expenses, indicating a broader inclusion of contingent commitments in its R&D cost base. Merck, on the other hand, not only incurs milestone obligations but is also eligible to receive future contingent sales-based milestone payments of up to $80 million, showing a two-way exposure where it both pays and receives milestone-linked funds depending on partnership dynamics. Together, these approaches highlight distinct strategies: Abbott\u2019s conservative recognition policy, Gilead\u2019s emphasis on upfront commitments in collaborations, and Merck\u2019s dual role as both payer and recipient in milestone arrangements.",

From time to time, we enter into development and collaboration agreements in which we share expenses with a collaboration partner. We record payments received from our collaborative partners for their share of the development costs as a reduction of Research and development expenses.\n\nClinical study costs are a significant component of Research and development expenses. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs. We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with our CROs. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual services completed by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Payments we make for research and development ('R&amp;D') services prior to the services being rendered are recorded as prepaid assets within Prepaid and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are expensed as the services are provided.\n\n## Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\n\nAcquired  in-process  research  and  development  expenses  are  recorded  when  incurred  and  reflect  costs  of  ex ternally-developed  in-process  research  and development ('IPR&amp;D') projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use, including upfront and pre-commercialization milestone payments related to various collaborations and the costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are recorded when incurred and consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, and selling, marketing and advertising expenses, as well as other general and administrative costs related to finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities.\n\nAdvertising expenses within Selling, general and administrative expenses, including promotional expenses, are recorded when incurred and were $869 million, $826 million and $778 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe provide stock-based compensation in the form of various types of equity-based awards, including restricted stock units ('RSUs'), performance share units ('PSUs')  and  stock  options,  and  through  our  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  and  the  International  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (together,  as  amended,  the 'ESPP'). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date, or the first date of the ESPP purchase period, and recognized  over  the  requisite  service  periods  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  using  the  straight-line  ex pense  attribution  approach,  reduced  for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience. The requisite service period could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible or if an employee terminates due to death or disability.\n\nThe estimated fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. For PSUs, depending on the terms of the award, estimated fair value is based on either the Monte Carlo valuation methodology or the closing stock price on the grant date. For stock option and ESPP awards, estimated fair value is based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Estimated inputs to that model include (i) expected volatility, based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock price along with implied volatility for traded options on our common stock, (ii) expected term in years, based on the weighted-average period awards are expected to remain outstanding using historical cancellation and exercise data, contractual terms and vesting terms of the award, (iii) risk-free interest  rate,  based  on  observed  interest  rates  appropriate  for  the  term  of  the  stock-based  awards,  and  (iv)  ex pected  dividend  yield,  based  on  our  history  and expectation of dividend payments.\n\n## Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share attributable to G ilead is calculated based on Net income attributable to G ilead on our Consolidated Statements of Operations divided by the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share attributable to G ilead is calculated based on Net income attributable to G ilead on our Consolidated Statements of Operations divided by the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock and other dilutive securities outstanding during the period. The potentially dilutive shares of our common stock resulting from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and equivalents are determined under the treasury stock method.",

Reblozyl is approved in the U.S., Europe, and certain other markets for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders and is also being evaluated for additional indications for hematology therapies. BM S is the principal on sales transactions for Reblozyl; however, M erck co-promotes Reblozyl (and may co-promote any future products approved under this collaboration) in North A merica, which is reimbursed by BMS. Merck receives tiered royalties ranging from 20% to 24% based on sales levels. This royalty will be reduced by 50% upon the earlier of patent expiry or generic entry on an indication-by-indication basis in each market. A dditionally, M erck is eligible to receive future contingent sales-based milestone payments of up to $80 million. A lliance revenue related to this collaboration (recorded within Sales ) consists of royalties and, for 2022, also includes the receipt of a regulatory approval milestone payment of $20 million. M erck recorded alliance revenue related to this collaboration of $371 million in 2024, $212 million in 2023 and $166 million in 2022.\n\n## 5.    R estructuring\n\nIn  January 2024, the Company approved a new restructuring program (2024 Restructuring Program) intended to continue the optimization of the Company's  Human  Health  global  manufacturing  network  as  the  future  pipeline  shifts  to  new  modalities  and  also  optimize  the  A nimal  Health  global manufacturing network to improve supply reliability and increase efficiency . The actions contemplated under the 2024 Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially  completed  by  the  end  of  2031,  with  the  cumulative  pretax  costs  to  be  incurred  by   the  Company  to  implement  the  program  estimated  to  be approximately $4.0 billion. A pproximately 60% of the cumulative pretax costs will be non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. The remainder of the costs will result in cash outlays, relating primarily to facility shut-down costs. The Company recorded total pretax costs of $888 million and $190 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively , related to the 2024 Restructuring Program, bringing total cumulative pretax costs incurred through December 31, 2024 to $1.1 billion.\n\nIn 2019, M erck approved a global restructuring program (2019 Restructuring Program) as part of a worldwide initiative focused on optimizing the Company's manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate footprint. The Company recorded total pretax costs of $743 million in 2023 and $666 million in 2022 related to the 2019 Restructuring Program. The actions under the 2019 Restructuring Program were substantially complete at the end of 2023 and, as of January 1, 2024, any remaining activities are being accounted for as part of the 2024 Restructuring Program.\n\nFor segment reporting, restructuring charges are unallocated expenses.",

      "question": "How do BMY, GILD, and MDT each quantify their U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, and what do their disclosures reveal about the strategic implications of these tax assets given differing expiration timelines and utilization constraints?",
      "answer": "BMY reports U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $585 million as of December 31, 2021, acquired through acquisitions and subject to Section 382 limitations, with expiration dates beginning in 2022. GILD discloses $250 million in U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2021, also noting expiration timelines starting in 2022. MDT reports $222 million in U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards as of April 29, 2022, with $47 million having no expiration and the rest expiring between fiscal years 2023 and 2036. Each company faces constraints on utilization due to ownership changes or jurisdictional limitations, and all maintain valuation allowances reflecting uncertainty in realizing the full benefit of these carryforwards.

          "chunk_text": "## Income Taxes\n\nValuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including longrange  forecasts  of  future  taxable  income  and  evaluation  of  tax  planning  initiatives.  Adjustments  to  the  deferred  tax  valuation allowances  are  made  to  earnings  in  the  period  when  such  assessments  are  made.  Our  deferred  tax  assets  were  $2.7  billion  at December  31,  2021  (net  of  valuation  allowances  of  $1.1  billion)  and  $3.5  billion  at  December  31,  2020  (net  of  valuation allowances of $2.8 billion).\n\nThe U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $585 million at December 31, 2021. These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards  expire  in  varying  amounts  beginning  in  2022.  The  foreign  and  state  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  expire  in varying amounts beginning in 2021 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).\n\nPrior to the Mead Johnson split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of Mead Johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares; and (iii) conversion of Mead Johnson &amp; Company to a limited liability company. These transactions as well as the split-off of Mead Johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the Internal Revenue Code based upon a private letter ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service related to the conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares, and outside legal opinions.\n\nCertain assumptions, representations and covenants by Mead Johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and  other  matters  which  could  affect  the  tax  treatment  of  the  exchange.  For  example,  the  current  tax  law  generally  creates  a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if Mead Johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. If the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value.\n\nIn addition, a negative basis or excess loss account ('ELA') existed in our investment in stock of Mead Johnson prior to these transactions. We received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ELA as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ELA. The tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, the Internal Revenue Service could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ELA. We could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. Based upon our understanding of the Internal Revenue Code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of Mead Johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009.\n\nWe agreed to certain tax related indemnities with Mead Johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement, including certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the initial public offering and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the IPO. Mead Johnson has also agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of Mead Johnson's stock or assets.\n\nLiabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.\n\nFor discussions on income taxes, refer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards-Income Taxes' and '-Note 7. Income Taxes.'\n\n## Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that  cover  a  wide  range  of  matters,  including,  among  others,  government  investigations,  shareholder  lawsuits,  product  and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. We recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates.\n\nFor discussions on contingencies, refer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently  Issued  Accounting  Standards-Contingencies,'  '-Note  7.  Income  Taxes'  and  '-Note  19.  Legal  Proceedings  and Contingencies.'",

The increase of our  valuation  allowance  in  2020  was  primarily  related  to  acquired  attributes  related  to  Forty  Seven  and  Immunomedics acquisitions, and capital losses related to our equity method investments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $250 million and $8 million, respectively, which will start to expire in 2022, if not utilized. In addition, we had state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.8 billion and $768 million, respectively. The state net operating loss and state tax credit carryforwards will start to expire in 2022 if not utilized.\n\nUtilization of net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. This annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating losses and credits before utilization.\n\nWe file  federal,  state  and  foreign  income  tax  returns  in  the  United  States  and  in  many  foreign  jurisdictions.  For  federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2016 and onwards and 2013 and onwards for California income tax purposes. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years.\n\nOur income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service and Irish tax authorities for our 2016 to 2018 tax years. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions.",

Certain of the remaining non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $6.8 billion have a valuation  allowance  recorded  against  the  carryforwards,  as  management  does  not  believe  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  these  net operating losses will be utilized.\n\nAt  April  29,  2022,  the  Company  had  $222  million  of  U.S.  federal  net  operating  loss  carryforwards,  of  which  $47  million  have  no expiration.

The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal year 2022 is primarily related to the step up in tax  basis  for  Swiss  Cantonal  purposes,  the  generation  of  certain  net  operating  losses  and  the  effects  of  currency  fluctuations.  These valuation allowances would result in a reduction to the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income if they are ultimately not required.\n\nThe Company's effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as follows:\n\n",

TMO, in contrast, does not directly link legal or regulatory risks to product revenues but provides detailed financial data showing a decline in product revenues from $30,361 million in 2021 to $25,243 million in 2023, without specifying regulatory or legal causes.

      "answer": "Abbott disclosed its funding strategy for international pension plans, contributing $349 million in 2023 and projecting $350 million for 2024, indicating a proactive funding approach. Merck provided a detailed breakdown of its international pension plan assets, showing a total fair value of $9.56 billion in 2023, with significant allocations to developed markets equities ($3.87 billion) and government obligations ($3.52 billion), suggesting a diversified but equity-heavy asset strategy. Pfizer reported an expected annual rate of return of 5.1% for its international pension plans in 2023, up from 4.5% in 2022, signaling increased optimism in market performance despite a negative actual return of 4.6% in 2023. Together, these disclosures reveal differing risk appetites and funding philosophies: Abbott focuses on consistent contributions, Merck emphasizes asset diversification, and Pfizer adjusts return expectations in response to market conditions.",

      "question": "How do Amgen, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic differ in the trends of the intrinsic value of options exercised over the past three years, and what might these differences suggest about executive compensation dynamics or stock performance across these healthcare firms?",
      "answer": "Amgen reported intrinsic values of options exercised as $33 million in 2023, down from $67 million in 2022 and $56 million in 2021, showing a declining trend. Johnson & Johnson, in contrast, had significantly higher intrinsic values at $729 million in 2023, following $1,228 million in 2022 and $919 million in 2021, indicating a large but decreasing value of exercised options. Medtronic reported intrinsic values of $28 million in fiscal 2024, down from $42 million in fiscal 2023 and $174 million in fiscal 2022, reflecting the sharpest decline among the three. These differences suggest varying patterns in stock performance or executive exercise behavior, with JNJ showing the highest realized value but also the largest drop from 2022 to 2023, potentially signaling changes in stock price timing or executive decision-making around option exercises.",

        "Hop 1: AMGN \u2192 Intrinsic Value of Options Exercised: Amgen shows a decline from $67 million in 2022 to $33 million in 2023, with a relatively modest overall value.",
        "Hop 2: JNJ \u2192 Intrinsic Value of Options Exercised: JNJ reports much higher values, starting at $919 million in 2021, peaking at $1,228 million in 2022, and declining to $729 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 3: MDT \u2192 Intrinsic Value of Options Exercised: Medtronic shows a steep drop from $174 million in 2022 to $42 million in 2023 and further to $28 million in 2024."
