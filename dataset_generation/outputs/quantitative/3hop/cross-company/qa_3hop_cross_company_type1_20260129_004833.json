      "question": "How does the intercompany natural gas purchase volume reported by Progress Energy under NEE's ownership compare to Duke Energy Carolinas' intercompany natural gas purchases in 2021, and what might this suggest about their respective internal energy sourcing strategies?",
      "answer": "Under NEE's ownership, Progress Energy reported $75 million in intercompany natural gas purchases in 2021, while Duke Energy Carolinas reported only $11 million for the same category. This significant difference suggests that Progress Energy relied more heavily on internal natural gas sourcing from affiliated entities compared to Duke Energy Carolinas, potentially indicating divergent internal energy allocation or procurement strategies within the broader Duke Energy consolidated group.",

        "Hop 1: NEE \u2192 Progress Energy: NEE owns Progress Energy, as stated in NEE's 2022 10-K filing, indicating NEE has a stake in the segment.",

Georgia Power also faces potential annual assessments of up to $89 million under NEIL policies, which could compound financial risk if bond values decline or decommissioning costs rise unexpectedly.",

Progress Energy contributes significantly to the broader Duke Energy consolidated liability, which amounts to $12,129 million in total noncurrent obligations.

For a discussion of environmental regulation, see 'Environmental Matters' in this section. See 'Other Matters' section of Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke Energy's operations.\n\n## COMMERCIAL RENEWABLES\n\nCommercial Renewables primarily acquires, develops, builds, operates and owns wind and solar renewable generation throughout the continental U.S. Commercial Renewables also enters into strategic transactions including minority ownership and tax equity structures in wind and solar generation. The portfolio includes nonregulated renewable energy and energy storage businesses.\n\nCommercial Renewables' renewable energy includes utility-scale wind and solar generation assets, distributed solar generation assets, distributed fuel cell assets and battery storage projects, which total 3,554 MW across 22 states from 23 wind facilities, 178 solar projects, 71 fuel cell locations and two battery storage facilities. Revenues are primarily generated by selling the power produced from renewable generation through long-term contracts to utilities, electric cooperatives, municipalities and corporate customers. In most instances, these customers have obligations under statemandated renewable energy portfolio standards or similar state or local renewable energy goals. Energy and renewable energy credits generated by wind and solar projects are generally sold at contractual prices. The following map shows the locations of renewable generation facilities of which Commercial Renewables has an ownership interest as of December 31, 2021.\n\nAs eligible projects are placed in service, Commercial Renewables generally recognizes either PTCs as power is generated by wind projects over 10 years or ITCs over the useful life of solar or fuel cell projects. Benefits of the tax basis adjustment due to the ITC are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the project is placed in service. Under the current law, the ITC for solar and fuel cells is being phased down from a rate of 30% for projects that began construction before 2020 to a permanent 10% rate for solar, and no ITC is available for fuel cells if construction begins after 2023. The PTC for onshore wind is currently phased out for projects beginning construction after 2021, but remains available for projects that began construction in 2021 or earlier.\n\nCommercial Renewables has entered into agreements for certain of its generating assets that are held by LLCs whose members include a noncontrolling tax equity investor. The allocation of tax attributes and cash flows to the tax equity investor are governed by the provisions of the LLC agreements. The GAAP earnings allocations to the tax equity investors can result in variability in earnings to Duke Energy as a result of the application of the HLBV method in allocating income or loss to the owners. As part of its growth strategy, Commercial Renewables expects to enter into these arrangements for future generating assets.\n\nFor additional information on Commercial Renewables' generation facilities, see Item 2, 'Properties.'",

This is an approximate 3.3% average increase in the customer's total bill across all customer classes. The drivers for this case are capital invested since Duke Energy Ohio's last electric distribution base rate case in 2017. Duke Energy Ohio is also seeking to adjust the caps on its Distribution Capital Investment (DCI) Rider. Duke Energy Ohio anticipates the PUCO will rule on the request by the summer of 2022. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.",

Interim rate adjustments became effective as of November 1, 2020, subject to refund, based on Virginia Natural Gas' original request for an increase of approximately $50 million. Refunds to customers related to the difference between the approved rates and the interim rates were completed during the fourth quarter 2021.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase for Nicor Gas effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\nOn July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas affiliates completed the sale of Sequent to Williams Field Services Group for a total cash purchase price of $159 million, including final working capital adjustments. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was approximately $121 million ($92 million after tax). As a result of the sale, changes in state apportionment rates resulted in $85 million of additional tax expense. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\nDuring the second and third quarters of 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to its equity method investment in the PennEast Pipeline project. On September 27, 2021, PennEast Pipeline announced that further development of the project is no longer supported, and, as a result, all further development of the project has ceased. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nIn striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approximately 8.7 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company Gas - Operating Metrics\" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.\n\nThe financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate RSE\" and \"Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan\" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.\n\nSouthern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.",

      "question": "How does Alabama Power's 2023 increase in fuel cost recovery impact Southern Company's cash flow compared to Duke Energy's recovery of $1.5 billion in deferred fuel costs during the same period?",
      "answer": "Alabama Power contributed to Southern Company's increased cash flow from operations in 2023, with its own $440 million increase in operating cash flow primarily driven by fuel cost recovery. This aligns with Southern Company's overall $1.3 billion increase in operating cash flow, which was also attributed to fuel cost recovery and timing of receivables. Meanwhile, Duke Energy recovered $1.5 billion in deferred fuel costs in 2023, which was a significant factor in normalizing its fuel cost balances after the undercollection in 2022 due to rising commodity prices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO \u2192 Alabama Power: Southern Company's consolidated cash flow from operations increased by $1.3 billion in 2023, with Alabama Power contributing significantly due to a $440 million increase in its operating cash flow driven by fuel cost recovery.",
        "Hop 2: Alabama Power \u2192 Fuel Cost Recovery: Alabama Power's 2023 increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to increased fuel cost recovery, showing a direct dependency on this financial mechanism.",
        "Hop 3: Fuel Cost Recovery \u2190 DUK: Duke Energy recovered $1.5 billion of deferred fuel costs in 2023, which was a key part of its financial strategy to offset the undercollection from 2022 and stabilize cash flows."

NEE, as a whole, reported a $775 million increase in fuel cost recovery revenues for the same period, largely due to higher fuel and energy prices.

Reserve  amortization  is  recorded  as  either  an  increase  or  decrease  to  accrued  asset  removal  costs  which  is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets at December 31, 2021 and in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020 on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Retail Base\n\nThe FPL segment's retail base revenues for 2021 and 2020 reflect the 2016 rate agreement. In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order approving  the  2016  rate  agreement  which  became  effective  in  January  2017  and  remained  in  effect  until  December  2021.  The  2016  rate agreement established the FPL segment's allowed regulatory ROE at 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60%, and allowed for retail rate base increases in 2017, 2018, and upon commencement of commercial operations at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and certain solar projects. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021 for additional information on the 2016 rate agreement.\n\nRetail base revenues decreased $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and were impacted by a decrease of 2.6% in the average usage per retail customer, primarily related to unfavorable weather when compared to the prior year, partly offset by an increase of 1.5% in the average number of customer accounts. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation.\n\n## Cost Recovery Clauses\n\nRevenues  from  fuel  and  other  cost  recovery  clauses  and  pass-through  costs,  such  as  franchise  fees,  revenue  taxes  and  storm-related surcharges, are largely a pass-through of costs. Such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery  clauses  on  certain  assets,  primarily  related  to  certain  solar,  environmental  projects,  storm  protection  plan  investments  and  the unamortized balance of the regulatory asset associated with the FPL segment's acquisition of certain generation facilities. See Item 1. Business FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Cost Recovery Clauses. Underrecovery or overrecovery of cost recovery clause and other pass-through costs (deferred clause and franchise expenses and revenues) can significantly affect NEE's and FPL's operating cash flows. The 2021 net underrecovery impacting the FPL segment's operating cash flows was approximately $516 million, primarily related to the fuel cost recovery clause.\n\nFuel cost recovery revenues increased approximately $775 million in 2021 primarily as a result of higher fuel and energy prices. In 2021 and 2020, cost recovery clauses contributed approximately $124 million and $111 million, respectively, to the FPL segment's net income. FPL's fuel cost recovery clause revenues and expenses are expected to increase in 2022 as a result of the collection of underrecovered 2021 fuel costs and higher projected natural gas prices in 2022.\n\n## Other Items Impacting the FPL Segment's Consolidated Statements of Income\n\nFuel, Purchase Power and Interchange Expense\n\nFuel, purchased power and interchange expense increased $807 million in 2021 primarily related to higher fuel and energy prices.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization Expense\n\nThe major components of the FPL segment's depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How does the fair value of municipal bonds held by DUK compare to Alabama Power's exposure to municipal bonds in its nuclear decommissioning trusts, and what implications might this have on Southern Company's financial risk given Alabama Power's potential liability under NEIL policies?",
      "answer": "DUK reported the fair value of its municipal bonds at $77 million in 2023, while Alabama Power held $1 million in municipal bonds as part of its nuclear decommissioning trusts. Alabama Power is subject to maximum annual assessments of $54 million under NEIL policies, which could be triggered if losses exceed available funds. Given the relatively small exposure to municipal bonds, Alabama Power\u2019s trust portfolio appears conservatively structured, but the potential for large retrospective assessments under NEIL could still pose a significant financial risk to Southern Company if a major nuclear incident occurs.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Municipal bonds: DUK disclosed a fair value of $77 million in municipal bonds as part of its investment portfolio in 2023.",

      "answer": "DUK reported a combined fair value gain of $17 million in 2023 for its hedges maturing in June 2028 and June 2034, while Southern Company Gas reported fair value losses of $79 million for its hedge maturing in January 2031.

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Hedge Maturity Date: DUK disclosed fair value gains of $17 million in 2023 for hedges maturing in June 2028 and June 2034.",

        "Hop 3: Southern Company Gas \u2190 SO: SO's disclosures show that Southern Company Gas is responsible for this $79 million fair value loss, indicating its exposure to interest rate risk on long-term hedged debt."

      "question": "How did the increase in NEE's fuel cost recovery revenues in 2021 influence Gulf Power's operating revenues, and what does this imply about Southern Company's financial exposure through its stake in Gulf Power?",
      "answer": "NEE's fuel cost recovery revenues increased by approximately $775 million in 2021 due to higher fuel and energy prices. This directly contributed to a $105 million increase in Gulf Power's operating revenues during the same period. Since Southern Company (SO) holds a stake in Gulf Power, as evidenced by their intercompany agreements and operational integration, SO's financial exposure is indirectly affected by the volatility in fuel costs and the pass-through mechanism of fuel cost recovery revenues. This implies that SO's consolidated financial performance is sensitive to fluctuations in Gulf Power's cost recovery mechanisms.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Retail Base\n\nThe FPL segment's retail base revenues for 2021 and 2020 reflect the 2016 rate agreement. In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order approving  the  2016  rate  agreement  which  became  effective  in  January  2017  and  remained  in  effect  until  December  2021.  The  2016  rate agreement established the FPL segment's allowed regulatory ROE at 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60%, and allowed for retail rate base increases in 2017, 2018, and upon commencement of commercial operations at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and certain solar projects. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021 for additional information on the 2016 rate agreement.\n\nRetail base revenues decreased $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and were impacted by a decrease of 2.6% in the average usage per retail customer, primarily related to unfavorable weather when compared to the prior year, partly offset by an increase of 1.5% in the average number of customer accounts. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation.\n\n## Cost Recovery Clauses\n\nRevenues  from  fuel  and  other  cost  recovery  clauses  and  pass-through  costs,  such  as  franchise  fees,  revenue  taxes  and  storm-related surcharges, are largely a pass-through of costs. Such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery  clauses  on  certain  assets,  primarily  related  to  certain  solar,  environmental  projects,  storm  protection  plan  investments  and  the unamortized balance of the regulatory asset associated with the FPL segment's acquisition of certain generation facilities. See Item 1. Business FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Cost Recovery Clauses. Underrecovery or overrecovery of cost recovery clause and other pass-through costs (deferred clause and franchise expenses and revenues) can significantly affect NEE's and FPL's operating cash flows. The 2021 net underrecovery impacting the FPL segment's operating cash flows was approximately $516 million, primarily related to the fuel cost recovery clause.\n\nFuel cost recovery revenues increased approximately $775 million in 2021 primarily as a result of higher fuel and energy prices. In 2021 and 2020, cost recovery clauses contributed approximately $124 million and $111 million, respectively, to the FPL segment's net income. FPL's fuel cost recovery clause revenues and expenses are expected to increase in 2022 as a result of the collection of underrecovered 2021 fuel costs and higher projected natural gas prices in 2022.\n\n## Other Items Impacting the FPL Segment's Consolidated Statements of Income\n\nFuel, Purchase Power and Interchange Expense\n\nFuel, purchased power and interchange expense increased $807 million in 2021 primarily related to higher fuel and energy prices.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization Expense\n\nThe major components of the FPL segment's depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:\n\n",

Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2016 rate agreement in order to achieve the  targeted  regulatory  ROE.  Reserve  amortization  is  recorded  as  either  an  increase  or  decrease  to  accrued  asset  removal  costs  which  is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets at December 31, 2021 and in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020 on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 -Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 - and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization - for discussion of reserve amortization, including certain limitations on reserve amortization in 2022, and new unified depreciation rates under the 2021 rate agreement.\n\n## Gulf Power: Results of Operations\n\nGulf Power's net income increased $33 million in 2021. During 2021, operating revenues increased $105 million primarily related to higher fuel cost recovery revenues. Operating expenses - net increased $89 million in 2021 primarily related to increases in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, partly offset by lower O&amp;M expenses.",

      "answer": "Gulf Power reported an $89 million increase in operating expenses - net during 2021, primarily driven by increases in fuel, purchased power, and interchange expenses, partly offset by lower O&M expenses. In contrast, NEE reported an overall increase of $309 million in operating expenses - net during 2021, attributed to a $116 million rise in depreciation expense linked to new investments, a $98 million increase in fuel costs, and a $73 million rise in O&M expenses, mainly due to bad debt associated with the February 2021 weather event. While both entities experienced increases, the cost drivers differ in composition and magnitude, with Gulf Power\u2019s changes being more focused on fuel and purchased power, while NEE\u2019s were broader, including depreciation and weather-related bad debt.",

      "question": "How does the nuclear decommissioning obligation tied to Piedmont's operations influence Duke Energy's remaining performance obligations for Piedmont in 2022, considering Southern Company's exposure to nuclear decommissioning liabilities?",
      "answer": "Southern Company (SO) reported nuclear decommissioning liabilities, which are part of broader industry obligations reflected in Duke Energy's consolidated figures. Duke Energy's Piedmont segment specifically had $22 million in total asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2021, a small portion of Duke's overall $12,776 million system-wide asset retirement obligation. Despite this small direct liability, Piedmont's remaining performance obligations for 2022 were $71 million, indicating ongoing commitments that may be indirectly affected by long-term liabilities such as decommissioning. This suggests that while Piedmont's direct nuclear decommissioning exposure is minimal, its performance obligations still operate within the broader context of Duke's long-term energy infrastructure liabilities.",

T o m eet these goals, we are safely transform ing and readying our system  by investing in secure and innovative technologies, m odernizing our gas and electric infrastructure and integrating efficiency and dem and m anagem ent program s. As we transition our business to m eet anticipated increased long-term  dem and while delivering more efficient sources of energy, we are focused on creating sustainable value for our custom ers and shareholders by leveraging business transform ation to exceed custom er expectations, optim izing investm ents to drive attractive shareholder returns and providing new product offerings and solutions that deliver growth and custom er value. T o achieve these objectives, we are partnering with stakeholders, cham pioning public policy that advances innovation and continuing to leverage regulatory m odels that support the delivery of reliable energy, tim ely cost recovery and affordable custom er rates.\n\n## Matters Impacting Future R esults\n\nThe m atters discussed herein could m aterially im pact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the D uke E nergy R egistrants and Business Segm ents.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\n## Coal Ash Costs\n\nI n April 2024, the E P A issued the 2024 C C R  R ule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 C C R  R ule by establishing regulatory requirem ents for inactive surface im poundm ents at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. D uke E nergy is participating in legal challenges to the 2024 C C R  R ule. Cost recovery for future expenditures is anticipated and will be pursued through the norm al ratem aking process with federal and state utility com m issions, which perm it recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with D uke E nergy's regulated operations. For m ore inform ation, see 'O ther M atters' and N otes 4 and 10 to the C onsolidated Financial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters\" and \"Asset R etirem ent O bligations.\"\n\n## Storm Cost Recovery\n\nFrom  August through October 2024, a series of m ajor storm  events occurred that resulted in significant dam age to utility infrastructure within our service territories and prim arily im pacted D uke E nergy C arolinas', D uke E nergy P rogress' and D uke E nergy F lorida's electric utility operations. H urricanes D ebby, H elene and M ilton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented dam age to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western N orth C arolina and upstate South Carolina. Appropriate storm  cost recovery m echanism s are in place to track and recover increm ental costs from  such events. F unding restoration activities and, in som e cases, the complete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this m agnitude has resulted in increm ental financing needs until cost recovery occurs and m ay im pact the near-term  results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the im pacted registrants.

D uke E nergy is analyzing the potential im pacts the rules could have on the C om pany, which could be m aterial and m ay influence the tim ing, nature, and m agnitude of future generation investm ents in our service territories. C ost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the norm al ratem aking process with federal and state utility commissions, which perm it recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with D uke E nergy's regulated operations. D uke E nergy is participating in legal challenges to the final rules. F or m ore inform ation, see \"O ther M atters.\"\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nThe Com pany continues to m onitor the ongoing stability of m arkets for key m aterials and public policy outcom es, including the potential im pacts from  possible new tariffs or other actions from  the new presidential adm inistration that could disrupt or im pact D uke E nergy's supply chain, future financial results, capital plan execution or the achievem ent of its energy transition.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants perform ed their annual goodwill im pairm ent tests as of August 31, 2024, as described in N ote 12 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"G oodwill and I ntangible Assets.\" As of this date, all of the D uke E nergy R egistrants' reporting units' estim ated fair values m aterially exceeded the carrying values except for the G U &amp;I reporting unit of D uke E nergy O hio. W hile no goodwill im pairm ent charges have been recorded in the accom panying C onsolidated Statem ents of O perations, the potential for deteriorating econom ic conditions im pacting G U &amp;I's future cash flows or equity valuations of peer com panies could im pact the estim ated fair value of G U &amp;I, and goodwill im pairm ent charges could be recorded in the future.\n\n## Other\n\nDuke E nergy continues to m onitor general m arket conditions, including the potential for interest rate pressures on the C om pany's cost of capital, which m ay im pact D uke E nergy's execution of its capital plan, future financial results, or the achievem ent of its energy transition.",

A t December 31, 2024 , NEER operates facilities, in which it has partial or full ownership interests, with a total generating capacity of approximately 41,500 MW. NEER primarily sells its capacity and/or energy output through long-term power sales agreements with utilities, retail electricity providers, power cooperatives,  municipal  electric  providers  and  commercial  and  industrial  customers. NEER  produces  the  majority  of  its  energy  from  clean  and  renewable sources as described more fully below. In addition, NEER develops and constructs battery storage projects, which when combined with its renewable projects, serve to enhance its ability to meet customers' firm capacity needs, or as standalone facilities. The NEER segment also owns, develops, constructs and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities in North A merica with a total rate base of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2024. NEER's rate-regulated transmission facilities and the transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities, including noncontrolling or joint venture interests, to the electric grid are comprised of approximately 370 substations and 3,885 circuit miles of transmission lines at December 31, 2024.\n\nNEER engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities, including entering into financial and physical contracts. These contracts primarily involve power and fuel commodities and their related products for the purpose of providing full energy and capacity requirements services, primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets, and offering customized power and fuel and related risk management services to wholesale customers, as well as to hedge the production from NEER's generation assets that is not sold under long-term power supply agreements. In addition, NEER participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production through operating and non-operating ownership interests, and in pipeline infrastructure construction, management and operations, through noncontrolling or joint venture interests.  NEER hedges the expected output from its natural gas and oil production assets to protect against price movements. During the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of selling ownership interests in certain natural gas and oil shale formations and in certain natural gas pipeline facilities (see Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/A ssets), NEER reassessed and changed its reporting unit structure to no longer report gas infrastructure as a separate reporting unit.\n\n## CLEAN ENERGY AND OTHER OPERATIONS\n\nNEER sells products associated with its generation facilities (energy , capacity , RECs and ancillary services) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities  are  located.  Customer  transactions  may  be  supplied  from  NEER  generation  facilities  or  from  purchases  in  the  wholesale  markets,  or  from  a combination thereof.

      "answer": "Southern Company Gas reported a fair value loss of $79 million on its hedging position maturing in January 2031, indicating significant exposure to long-term interest rate risk. In contrast, Duke Energy reported fair value gains of $17 million and $15 million on hedges maturing in June 2028 and June 2034, respectively, suggesting a more favorable hedge positioning or market conditions for longer-dated maturities.

      "question": "How does the $1.5 billion in deferred fuel cost recovery collected by Duke Energy in 2023 impact Georgia Power\u2019s cash flow dynamics, particularly in light of Southern Company's broader financial exposure to nuclear construction and insurance liabilities?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy collected $1.5 billion in deferred fuel costs in 2023, which helped stabilize its cash flows after underrecovering fuel costs in 2022. This fuel cost recovery mechanism is also critical for Georgia Power, a Southern Company subsidiary, as noted by the $714 million increase in Georgia Power\u2019s 2023 operating cash flow attributed to increased fuel cost recovery. However, Georgia Power faces significant financial exposure from nuclear construction at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as well as potential insurance liabilities that could reach up to $89 million in annual NEIL policy assessments. These factors create a complex financial environment where fuel cost recovery plays a key role in maintaining liquidity, especially as Southern Company must balance nuclear construction costs and insurance risk exposure across its regulated subsidiaries.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Fuel Cost Recovery: Duke Energy collected $1.5 billion in deferred fuel costs in 2023, which stabilized cash flow after 2022 undercollections.",
        "Hop 2: Fuel Cost Recovery \u2192 Georgia Power: Georgia Power saw a $714 million increase in operating cash flow in 2023 due to improved fuel cost recovery, showing its importance to the utility\u2019s financial health.",
        "Hop 3: Georgia Power \u2190 SO: Southern Company's financial statements highlight Georgia Power's exposure to nuclear construction at Plant Vogtle and potential insurance liabilities up to $89 million annually, which could materially affect its financial condition."

      "question": "How does the $14 million in SAVE program-related rate recovery approved for Virginia Natural Gas in 2021 compare to the interim rate mechanisms used by Duke Energy's gas utilities in North Carolina and Tennessee, particularly in terms of timing and refund policies?",
      "answer": "Virginia Natural Gas received $14 million in approved rate recovery tied to the SAVE program, with interim rates taking effect on November 1, 2020, subject to refund. In contrast, Duke Energy's North Carolina rate case allowed for $67 million in stipulated interim rates effective November 1, 2021, with no required refunds upon final approval. Similarly, in Tennessee, Duke implemented interim rates on January 2, 2021, with a subsequent refund of the difference between interim and approved rates. This shows that while all three cases involved interim rates, Virginia's mechanism required a refund based on the difference between interim and final rates, similar to Tennessee but unlike the no-refund outcome in North Carolina.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nOn February 16, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia PSC staff establishing a long-range comprehensive planning process. Under the terms of the stipulation, Atlanta Gas Light was required to develop and file at least triennially an Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan (i-CDP). Each i-CDP will include a 10-year forecast of interstate and intrastate capacity asset requirements, including a detailed plan for the first three years consistent with Atlanta Gas Light's current capacity supply plan, and a 10-year projection of capital budgets and related operations and maintenance spending. Recovery of the related revenue requirements will be included in either subsequent annual GRAM filings or a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects.\n\nOn April 28, 2021, Atlanta Gas Light filed its first i-CDP with the Georgia PSC, which includes a series of ongoing and proposed pipeline safety, reliability, and growth programs for the next 10 years (2022 through 2031), as well as the required capital investments and related costs to implement the programs. The i-CDP reflected capital investments totaling approximately $0.5 billion to $0.6 billion annually.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved an October 14, 2021 joint stipulation agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC, under which, for the years 2022 through 2024, Atlanta Gas Light will incrementally reduce its combined GRAM and System Reinforcement Rider request by 10% through Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM mechanism, or $5 million for 2022. The stipulation agreement also provides for $1.7 billion of total capital investment for the years 2022 through 2024. Also on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's amended annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of $43 million effective January 1, 2022.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nOn September 14, 2021, the Virginia Commission approved a stipulation agreement related to Virginia Natural Gas' June 2020 general rate case filing, which allows for a $43 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $14 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, based on a ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 51.9%. Interim rate adjustments became effective as of November 1, 2020, subject to refund, based on Virginia Natural Gas' original request for an increase of approximately $50 million. Refunds to customers related to the difference between the approved rates and the interim rates were completed during the fourth quarter 2021.\n\n## Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs\n\nAs discussed under \"Utility Regulation and Rate Design,\" the natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms to recover bad debt expense, which helped mitigate potential increases in bad debt expense as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Deferred incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic were immaterial for Virginia Natural Gas.\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nIn April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Atlanta Gas Light to continue its previous, voluntary suspension of customer disconnections. In June 2020, the Georgia PSC ordered Atlanta Gas Light to resume customer disconnections beginning July 2020, with exceptions for customers still covered by a shelter-in-place order. All suspensions for customer disconnections were lifted in October 2020. The orders provide the Marketers, including SouthStar, with a mechanism to receive credits from Atlanta Gas Light for the base rates it charged to the Marketers of non-paying customers during the suspension. Atlanta Gas Light will begin recovering these credits through GRAM rates effective January 1, 2023.\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Illinois Commission issued an order directing utilities to cease disconnections for non-payment and to suspend the imposition of late payment fees or penalties. In June 2020, the Illinois Commission approved a stipulation pursuant to which Nicor Gas and other utilities in Illinois would provide more flexible credit and collection procedures to assist customers with financial hardship and which authorizes a special purpose rider for recovery of the following COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts: incremental costs directly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, net of the offset for COVID-19 pandemic-related credits received, foregone late fees, foregone reconnection charges, and the costs associated with a bill payment assistance program. Nicor Gas resumed late payment fees in July 2020 and, on October 1, 2020, began recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts through the special purpose rider, which will continue over a 24-month period. On March 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a phased-in schedule for disconnections related to non-payment. Nicor Gas began certain disconnections in late April 2021 and resumed normal disconnections in June 2021. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Nicor Gas' related regulatory asset was $5 million and $9 million, respectively.",

See Note 22 for additional detail.\n\n## 2020 Tennessee Rate Case\n\nOn July 2, 2020, Piedmont filed an application with the TPUC, its first general rate case in Tennessee in nine years, for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $30 million, which represents an approximate 15% increase in annual revenues. The rate increase is driven by significant infrastructure upgrade investments since Piedmont's previous rate case. Approximately half of the plant additions being added to rate base are categories of capital investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was approved in 2013. Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $26 million in December 2020. As authorized under Tennessee law, Piedmont implemented interim rates on January 2, 2021, at the level requested in its adjusted request. A settlement reached with the Tennessee Consumer Advocate in mid-January was approved by the TPUC on February 16, 2021. The settlement results in an increase of revenues of approximately $16 million and an ROE of 9.8%. Revised customer rates became effective on January 2, 2021. Piedmont refunded customers the difference between bills previously rendered under interim rates and such bills if rendered under approved rates, plus interest in April 2021.\n\n## 2021 North Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn March 22, 2021, Piedmont filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $109 million, which represents an approximate 10% increase in retail revenues. The rate increase is driven by customer growth and significant infrastructure upgrade investments (plant additions) since the last general rate case. Approximately 70% of the plant additions being rolled into rate base are categories of plant investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was originally approved as part of the 2013 North Carolina Rate Case. On July 28, 2021, Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $97 million.\n\nOn September 7, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff, the Carolina Utility Customers Association, Inc. and the Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates IV filed a Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Stipulation), which is subject to review and approval by the NCUC, resolving most issues between these parties. Major components of the Stipulation include:\n\n- A return on equity of 9.6% and a capital structure of 51.6% equity and 48.4% debt;\n- Continuation of the IMR mechanism and margin decoupling; and\n- A base rate increase of approximately $67 million, subject to completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project.\n\nAn evidentiary hearing to review the Stipulation and other issues concluded on September 9, 2021. On October 12, 2021, Piedmont notified the NCUC of its intent to implement the stipulated rates effective November 1, 2021, on a temporary basis and subject to refund. On October 18, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff filed supplemental testimony attesting to the completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project and to the propriety of including the capital investment for these two projects in this proceeding. On January 6, 2022, the NCUC issued an order approving the Stipulation. No refunds need to be rendered to customers arising from Piedmont's implementation of interim rates.\n\n## OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC\n\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP pipeline) was planned to be an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia to North Carolina. Duke Energy indirectly owns a 47% interest, which is accounted for as an equity method investment through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment.\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty created by various legal rulings, the potential impact on the cost and schedule for the project, the ongoing legal challenges and the risk of additional legal challenges and delays through the construction period and Dominion's decision to sell substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, Duke Energy's Board of Directors and management decided that it was not prudent to continue to invest in the project. On July 5, 2020, Duke Energy and Dominion announced the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project.\n\nAs part of the pretax charges to earnings of approximately $2.1 billion recorded in June 2020, within Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates on the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations, Duke Energy established liabilities related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately $855 million to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee. At December 31, 2021, there is $47 million and $53 million within Other Current Liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities, respectively, in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment. The liabilities represent Duke Energy's obligation of approximately $100 million to satisfy remaining ARO requirements to restore construction sites.\n\nSee Notes 7 and 12 for additional information regarding this transaction.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Gulf Power's purchased power and interchange expense in 2021 affect NEE's regulatory asset amortization strategy, and what does this imply about Southern Company's (SO) financial exposure through its intercompany agreements with Gulf Power?",
      "answer": "Gulf Power experienced a significant increase in purchased power and interchange expense in 2021, which contributed to an $89 million rise in its operating expenses\u2014net. This increase likely contributed to the deferral mechanisms NEE uses to manage cost recovery, as seen in NEE's 2022 filing where it defers underrecovered or overrecovered costs related to purchased power and interchange expense under cost recovery clauses. NEE's regulatory asset amortization strategy reflects this, with certain assets being amortized over 20 years or approximately 9 years, depending on the clause. Southern Company (SO), through its intercompany interchange agreements with Gulf Power, is financially exposed to these rising costs, as these agreements facilitate the sharing of power and cost impacts across subsidiaries, suggesting that SO's financial performance could be indirectly affected by Gulf Power's expense volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE \u2192 Purchased Power and Interchange Expense: NEE defers net underrecovery or overrecovery of costs like purchased power and interchange expense, with regulatory assets amortized over 9 or 20 years.",
        "Hop 2: Purchased Power and Interchange Expense \u2192 Gulf Power: Gulf Power\u2019s operating expenses\u2014net increased $89 million in 2021, primarily due to higher fuel, purchased power, and interchange costs.",
        "Hop 3: Gulf Power \u2190 SO: SO has intercompany agreements with Gulf Power, including the Intercompany Interchange Contract revised in 2007, which facilitates power sharing and cost transfer, exposing SO to Gulf Power's cost fluctuations."

      "question": "How does the expected nuclear decommissioning liability of NEER, expressed in 2024 dollars, compare to Duke Energy's nuclear decommissioning liabilities, and what does this imply about the relative financial exposure of these two entities to nuclear plant retirement obligations?",
      "answer": "NEER's expected nuclear decommissioning liability, expressed in 2024 dollars, is approximately $2.2 billion out of an ultimate cost estimate of $9.8 billion. Duke Energy (DUK) has significant nuclear decommissioning liabilities as well, with recent cost studies factoring in closure and decontamination expenses for its 11 operating reactors. However, NEER\u2019s liability is specifically quantified in 2024 dollars, while Duke Energy\u2019s liability is assessed through periodic updates and includes both spent nuclear fuel disposal and plant decommissioning. This suggests that while both companies face substantial nuclear decommissioning exposure, NEER\u2019s liability is more precisely defined in current terms, whereas Duke Energy\u2019s exposure is broader and subject to ongoing regulatory and operational assessments.",

As of Decem ber 31, 2024, the inventory balance for E U &amp;I was approxim ately $4.4 billion. F or additional inform ation on inventory, see N ote 1 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, 'Sum m ary of Significant Accounting P olicies.'\n\n## Ash Basin Management\n\nThe E P A has issued regulations related to the m anagem ent of C C R  from  power plants, including the 2015 and 2024 C C R  R ules. T hese regulations classify C C R  as nonhazardous waste under R C R A and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and new and existing surface im poundm ents and establish requirem ents regarding design and operating criteria, groundwater m onitoring and corrective action, closure requirem ents and post-closure care, and recordkeeping, notifications, and internet posting requirem ents for the disposal and m anagem ent of C C R . In addition to the federal regulations, C C R  landfills and surface im poundm ents (ash basins or im poundm ents) will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and perm its, such as the N orth C arolina C oal Ash M anagem ent Act of 2014 (C oal Ash Act).\n\nEU&amp;I has and will periodically subm it to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash im poundm ent rem ediation or closure plans. C losure plans m ust be approved and all associated perm its issued before any work can begin. At all sites requiring C C R  closure and groundwater rem ediation, closure m ethods and groundwater corrective action rem edies have been studied and factored into the estim ated retirem ent and m anagem ent costs.\n\nThe 2015 and 2024 E P A C C R  R ules and the C oal Ash Act leave the decision on cost recovery determ inations related to closure of coal ash surface im poundm ents to the norm al ratem aking processes before utility regulatory com m issions. D uke E nergy's electric utilities have included com pliance costs associated with federal and state requirem ents in their respective rate proceedings. Additionally, D uke E nergy C arolinas' and D uke E nergy P rogress' wholesale contracts were am ended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The am ended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions lim iting challenges to C C R  cost recovery actions at F E R C . F or additional inform ation on the ash basins and recovery, see Item  7, \"O ther M atters\" and N otes 4, 5 and 10 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters,\" \"C om m itm ents and Contingencies\" and \"Asset R etirem ent O bligations,\" respectively.\n\n## Nuclear Matters\n\nDuke E nergy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. T he C rystal R iver U nit 3 perm anently ceased operation in F ebruary 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property dam age coverage; nuclear accident decontam ination and prem ature decom m issioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a m ajor accidental outage. Joint owners reim burse D uke E nergy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreem ents. The P rice-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claim s resulting from  nuclear incidents to the m axim um  total financial protection liability, which is approxim ately $16.2 billion. F or additional inform ation on nuclear insurance, see N ote 5 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, 'C om m itm ents and C ontingencies.'\n\nDuke E nergy has a significant future financial com m itm ent to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decom m ission and decontam inate each plant safely. T he N C U C  and the P SC SC  require Duke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress to update cost estim ates for decom m issioning their nuclear plants every five years. T he nuclear decom m issioning liabilities are assessed and updated based on changes in cash flows provided in new studies as well as annual assessm ents to evaluate whether any indicators suggest a change in the estim ate of the AR O  is necessary.\n\nThe following table sum m arizes the fair value of N D T F  investm ents and the m ost recent site-specific nuclear decom m issioning cost studies. D ecom m issioning costs are stated in 2023 or 2024 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decom m ission plant com ponents not subject to radioactive contam ination.\n\n",

In comparison, the Southern Company Parent segment reported a significantly higher total fair value loss of $269 million in 2024, with a notional amount of $1,900 million and hedge maturities extending through April 2030.

          "chunk_text": "\nFuel and purchased power expenses were $496 million in 2021, an increase of $124 million, or 33.3%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of natural gas.\n\nFuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Mississippi Power - Fuel Cost Recovery\" and Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Fuel Costs\" for additional information.\n\nFuel expense increased $120 million, or 34.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a 44.7% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, partially offset by a 4.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.\n\nEnergy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.\n\n## Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses\n\nOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $29 million, or 10.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. A portion of the increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily due to increases of $7 million associated with the Kemper County energy facility (primarily related to increases in dismantlement activities and less salvage proceeds in 2021), $7 million in generation expenses associated with outage and non-outage maintenance, $6 million in distribution operations and maintenance, and $6 million in compensation and benefit expenses.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net increased $18 million, or 105.9%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $9 million decrease in charitable donations and increases of $6 million in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income and $3 million in interest associated with a sales-type lease. See Notes 9 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes increased $7 million, or 50.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher pre-tax earnings and an increase associated with lower flowback of excess deferred income taxes associated with new PEP rates that became effective for the first billing cycle of April 2021.

Key aspects of the order include the approval of N orth Carolina retail rate base for the historic base case of approxim ately $12.2 billion and capital projects and related costs to be included in the three-year M YR P , including $3.5 billion (North C arolina retail allocation) projected to go in service over the M YR P  period. T he order established an R O E  of 9.8% based upon an equity ratio of 53% equity and approved, with certain adjustm ents, depreciation rates and the recovery of grid im provem ent plan costs and certain deferred C O VID -related costs. Additionally, the R esidential D ecoupling M echanism and P I M s were approved as requested under the P BR  Application and revised by the partial settlem ents. As a result of the order, D uke E nergy P rogress recognized pretax charges of $28 m illion within I m pairm ent of assets and other charges, which prim arily related to certain C O VID -19 deferred costs, and $8 m illion within O perations, m aintenance and other, for the year ended D ecem ber 31, 2023, on the C onsolidated Statem ents of O perations.

The m ajor com ponents of the stipulation include an R O E  of 9.6% based upon an equity ratio of 52.43% along with the establishm ent of a storm  reserve to help offset the costs of m ajor storm s. T he stipulation provided for a $52 m illion annual custom er rate increase prior to the reduction from  the accelerated return to custom ers of federal unprotected P roperty, P lant and E quipm ent related E D I T ; after extending the rem aining E D I T  giveback to custom ers to 33 m onths, the net annual retail rate increase is approxim ately $36 m illion. I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation). T he 2021 D epreciation Study was accepted as proposed in this case, as adjusted for certain recom m endations from  O R S and includes accelerated retirem ent dates for certain coal units as originally proposed. T he P SC SC  held a hearing in January 2023 and a final written order was issued on M arch 8, 2023. N ew rates went into effect April 1, 2023.\n\n## Person County Combined Cycle CPCNs\n\n",

The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%. Rate adjustments were effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the fourth quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts\n\nThe following table illustrates Southern Company Gas' authorized ratemaking amounts that are not recognized on its balance sheets. These amounts are primarily comprised of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain regulatory infrastructure programs. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in Southern Company Gas' financial statements in the periods they are billable to customers, the majority of which will be recovered by 2025.\n\n",

These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and ex ecution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance.\n\nThe financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate RSE\" and \"Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan\" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics.\n\nSouthern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Southern Company\n\nConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $4.4 billion in 2024, an increase of $425 million, or 10.7%, from 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing and weather impacts, an increase in natural gas revenues associated with rate increases, an increase in other revenues, and an increase in other electric revenues, partially offset by increases in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and cost of other sales.\n\nBasic EPS was $4.02 in 2024 and $3.64 in 2023. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares primarily related to stock-based compensation, was $3.99 in 2024 and $3.62 in 2023. EPS for 2024 and 2023 was negatively impacted by $0.01 and $0.06 per",

      "question": "How does the distribution of NEER's 30,600 MW of net generating capacity across wind, solar, and other sources impact Southern Company's (SO) energy revenue streams, particularly in relation to SO's reliance on contracted renewable energy output?",
      "answer": "NEER's 30,600 MW of net generating capacity at December 31, 2023, is primarily composed of 47% wind (14,382 MW), 18% solar (5,508 MW), and 6% nuclear and rate-regulated transmission each, with additional contributions from oil and gas production assets (16%). NEER sells the majority of this energy output through long-term power sales agreements, which aligns with Southern Company's (SO) strategy of sourcing energy from contracted renewable facilities. SO's solar and wind energy revenues are predominantly derived from long-term PPAs that do not include capacity revenue, making SO highly dependent on the consistent energy output from these renewable sources. Therefore, the geographic and technological diversification of NEER's generation capacity directly supports SO's ability to secure stable energy supply and revenue from renewable sources, despite variability in weather and equipment performance affecting actual output.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NEE \u2192 NEER: NEE owns NEER, which has 30,600 MW of net generating capacity, with 47% wind, 18% solar, 6% nuclear, and 6% rate-regulated transmission at December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 2: NEER \u2192 Energy Output: NEER sells the majority of its energy output through long-term power sales agreements, with a focus on wind and solar generation, which totaled approximately 14,382 MW and 5,508 MW respectively.",
        "Hop 3: Energy Output \u2190 SO: Southern Company (SO) relies on contracted renewable energy output for its solar and wind revenue, primarily through long-term PPAs that depend on the level of energy generated, which can be affected by weather and operational factors."

If approved, new rates will become effective January 1 of the following year.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which included annual base rate increases of $72 million, $73 million, and $74 million effective January 1, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of the existing SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the program includes investments of $70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with a potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a max imum total investment over the five-year extension (2025 through 2029) of $355 million.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of $63 million, including $17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%. Rate adjustments were effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the fourth quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nIn striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approx imately 8.9 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and ex ecution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance.\n\nThe financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate RSE\" and \"Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan\" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics.\n\nSouthern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Southern Company\n\nConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $4.4 billion in 2024, an increase of $425 million, or 10.7%, from 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing and weather impacts, an increase in natural gas revenues associated with rate increases, an increase in other revenues, and an increase in other electric revenues, partially offset by increases in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and cost of other sales.\n\nBasic EPS was $4.02 in 2024 and $3.64 in 2023. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares primarily related to stock-based compensation, was $3.99 in 2024 and $3.62 in 2023. EPS for 2024 and 2023 was negatively impacted by $0.01 and $0.06 per",

The i-CDP allows capital investments totaling approximately $0.6 billion annually for the years 2025 through 2027 with related revenue requirement recovery through either the annual GRAM filing or the System Reinforcement Rider surcharge adjustment. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of Transportation infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge will be based on requests filed annually on September 1. If approved, new rates will become effective January 1 of the following year.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nIn August 2023, the Virginia Commission approved a stipulation related to Virginia Natural Gas' August 2022 general base rate case filing, which allowed for a $48 million increase in annual base rate revenues based on an ROE of 9.70% and an equity ratio of 49.06%. Interim rates became effective as of January 1, 2023, subject to refund, based on Virginia Natural Gas' original requested increase of approximately $69 million. Refunds to customers related to the difference between the approved rates effective September 1, 2023 and the interim rates were completed during the fourth quarter 2023.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of $63 million, including $17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts\n\nThe following table illustrates Southern Company Gas' authorized ratemaking amounts that are not recognized on its balance sheets. These amounts are primarily comprised of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain regulatory infrastructure programs. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in Southern Company Gas' financial statements in the periods they are billable to customers, the majority of which will be recovered by 2025.\n\n",

The m ajor com ponents of the stipulation include an R O E  of 9.6% based upon an equity ratio of 52.43% along with the establishm ent of a storm  reserve to help offset the costs of m ajor storm s. T he stipulation provided for a $52 m illion annual custom er rate increase prior to the reduction from  the accelerated return to custom ers of federal unprotected P roperty, P lant and E quipm ent related E D I T ; after extending the rem aining E D I T  giveback to custom ers to 33 m onths, the net annual retail rate increase is approxim ately $36 m illion. I t also allowed continuation of deferral treatm ent of coal ash basin closure costs and supports an am ortization period for rem aining coal ash closure costs in this rate case of seven years. D uke E nergy P rogress agreed not to seek recovery of approxim ately $50 m illion of deferred coal ash expenditures related to retired sites in this rate case (South Carolina retail allocation).

      "question": "How did the contrasting trends in fuel cost recovery between Georgia Power and Duke Energy in 2021 impact their respective operating cash flows, particularly in relation to nuclear construction spending at Georgia Power?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power experienced a $37 million decrease in operating cash flow in 2021 due to reduced fuel cost recovery, which was partially offset by customer bill credits and timing of collections. This occurred alongside significant nuclear construction spending of $1.3 billion on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, increasing financial pressure. Meanwhile, Duke Energy saw a $14 million increase in fuel cost recovery driven by higher fuel prices and volumes, contributing positively to its operating cash flow. These opposing trends in fuel cost recovery directly influenced each company's cash flow dynamics, with Georgia Power facing headwinds during a major capital investment phase and Duke Energy benefiting from cost recovery mechanisms.",

      "answer": "Alabama Power's common stock dividend payments in 2021 reduced Southern Company's net cash provided by financing activities, as these payments were partially offset by long-term debt issuances and capital contributions. Specifically, Alabama Power's financing cash flows were characterized by dividend outflows despite capital contributions from Southern Company. In contrast, Duke Energy faces regulatory restrictions from its subsidiaries (e.g., Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress, Ohio, Indiana, and Piedmont) that limit dividend payments to the parent company, creating a more constrained dividend policy environment. This suggests Southern Company maintains greater internal capital flexibility through its subsidiaries compared to Duke Energy's externally restricted structure.",

However, if Duke Energy were to defer dividend payments on the preferred stock, the declaration of common stock dividends would be prohibited. See Note 19 for more information. Additionally, as further described in Note 3, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont have restrictions on paying dividends or otherwise advancing funds to Duke Energy due to conditions established by regulators in conjunction with merger transaction approvals. At December 31, 2021, and 2020, an insignificant amount of Duke Energy's consolidated Retained earnings balance represents undistributed earnings of equity method investments.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\nThe following new accounting standard was adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants in 2021.\n\nLeases with Variable Lease Payments. In July 2021, the FASB issued new accounting guidance requiring lessors to classify a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or rate as an operating lease if both of the following are met: (1) the lease would have to be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease under prior guidance, and (2) the lessor would have recognized a day-one loss. Duke Energy elected to adopt the guidance immediately upon issuance of the new standard and will be applying the new standard prospectively to new lease arrangements meeting the criteria. Duke Energy did not have any lease arrangements that this new accounting guidance materially impacted.\n\nThe following new accounting standard was adopted by Duke Energy Registrants in 2020.\n\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses. In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for credit losses. Duke Energy adopted the new accounting guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method of adoption, which does not require restatement of prior year results. Duke Energy did not adopt any practical expedients.\n\nDuke Energy recognizes allowances for credit losses based on management's estimate of losses expected to be incurred over the lives of certain assets or guarantees. Management monitors credit quality, changes in expected credit losses and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a forward-looking basis. Management reviews the risk of loss periodically as part of the existing assessment of collectability of receivables.",

      "question": "How did Alabama Power's 2021 cash flow from operations compare to Duke Energy's, given their differing experiences with fuel cost recovery and fuel price volatility?",
      "answer": "Alabama Power's 2021 cash flow from operations increased by $311 million compared to 2020, despite a decrease in fuel cost recovery, which was offset by higher retail revenues and timing factors. In contrast, Duke Energy experienced a $14 million increase in fuel cost recovery driven by higher fuel prices and volumes during the same period. This comparison reveals differing financial exposures to fuel price volatility, with Alabama Power benefiting from retail rate adjustments and Duke Energy facing upward pressure on fuel recovery due to rising costs.",

      "answer": "The $14 million increase in fuel cost recovery at Duke Energy (DUK) in 2022 was driven by higher fuel prices and volumes, which positively contributed to its operating cash flow. In contrast, Alabama Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company (SO), experienced a decrease in fuel cost recovery that partially offset an increase in retail revenues and higher customer usage. This divergence in fuel cost recovery trends between DUK and Alabama Power highlights the regional and operational differences affecting cash flow dynamics across traditional electric operating companies. The broader implication is that while DUK benefited from cost recovery mechanisms aligned with rising fuel costs, Alabama Power faced headwinds that constrained its operating cash flow growth despite higher retail revenues.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nNEER's interest expense for 2021 decreased approximately $292 million primarily reflecting $251 million of favorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments.\n\n## Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees\n\nNEER recognized $666 million of equity in earnings of equity method investees in 2021 compared to $1,351 million of equity in losses of equity method investees for the prior year. The change for 2021 primarily reflects the absence of an impairment charge related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in 2020 and higher equity in earnings of NEP recorded in 2021 primarily due to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. Due to continued legal and regulatory challenges related to Mountain Valley Pipeline, NextEra Energy Resources also recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of 2022 of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax). See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\n\n## Tax Credits, Benefits and Expenses\n\nPTCs from wind projects and ITCs from solar and certain wind projects are reflected in NEER's earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. Reflected in income taxes in NEE's consolidated statements of income are PTCs totaling approximately $90 million and $150 million and ITCs totaling approximately $237 million and $133 million in  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  A  portion  of  the  PTCs  and  ITCs  have  been  allocated  to  investors  in  connection  with  sales  of  differential membership interests. See Note 1 - Income Taxes for a discussion of PTCs and ITCs and Note 5.\n\n## Corporate and Other: Results of Operations\n\nCorporate and Other at NEE is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to NextEra Energy Resources. Interest expense is allocated  based  on  a  deemed  capital  structure  of  70%  debt  and  differential  membership  interests  sold  by  NextEra  Energy  Resources' subsidiaries.\n\nCorporate and Other's results increased $268 million during 2021 primarily due to favorable after-tax impacts of approximately $370 million, as compared to the prior year, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. The favorable non-qualifying hedge activity was partly offset by higher interest and refinancing costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures (see Note 15 - Commitments), investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses (see Note 6), payment of maturing debt and related derivative obligations (see Note 13 and Note 3) and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors and  sales  of  assets  to  NEP  or  third  parties  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interest), consistent with NEE's and FPL's objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.\n\nIn  October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $150 million of common units representing limited partner interests  in  NEP.  Under  the  program,  purchases  may  be  made  in  amounts,  at  prices  and  at  such  times  as  NEE  or  its  subsidiaries  deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Any purchases will be made in such quantities, at such prices, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as determined by NEE or its subsidiaries in their discretion, based on factors such as market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common unit purchase program does not require NEE to acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated  by  NEE  at  any  time.  The  purpose  of  the  program  is  not  to  cause  NEP's  common  units  to  be  delisted  from  the  New  York  Stock Exchange or to cause the common units to be deregistered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2021, the dollar value of units that may yet be purchased by NEE under this program was $114 million. At December 31, 2021, NEE owned a noncontrolling general partner interest in NEP and beneficially owned approximately 55.0% of NEP's voting power.",

In most instances, these customers have obligations under statemandated renewable energy portfolio standards or similar state or local renewable energy goals. Energy and renewable energy credits generated by wind and solar projects are generally sold at contractual prices. The following map shows the locations of renewable generation facilities of which Commercial Renewables has an ownership interest as of December 31, 2021.\n\nAs eligible projects are placed in service, Commercial Renewables generally recognizes either PTCs as power is generated by wind projects over 10 years or ITCs over the useful life of solar or fuel cell projects. Benefits of the tax basis adjustment due to the ITC are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the project is placed in service. Under the current law, the ITC for solar and fuel cells is being phased down from a rate of 30% for projects that began construction before 2020 to a permanent 10% rate for solar, and no ITC is available for fuel cells if construction begins after 2023. The PTC for onshore wind is currently phased out for projects beginning construction after 2021, but remains available for projects that began construction in 2021 or earlier.\n\nCommercial Renewables has entered into agreements for certain of its generating assets that are held by LLCs whose members include a noncontrolling tax equity investor. The allocation of tax attributes and cash flows to the tax equity investor are governed by the provisions of the LLC agreements. The GAAP earnings allocations to the tax equity investors can result in variability in earnings to Duke Energy as a result of the application of the HLBV method in allocating income or loss to the owners. As part of its growth strategy, Commercial Renewables expects to enter into these arrangements for future generating assets.\n\nFor additional information on Commercial Renewables' generation facilities, see Item 2, 'Properties.'",

      "answer": "The $14 million increase in fuel cost recovery at Duke Energy in 2022 reflects a strategy to offset rising fuel costs, which is a challenge also faced by Georgia Power. Georgia Power reported a $37 million decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020, largely due to decreased fuel cost recovery. This cash flow pressure is further complicated by the significant financial uncertainties surrounding the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, where cost recovery faces regulatory scrutiny and potential challenges from co-owners and the Georgia Public Service Commission. Thus, while Duke Energy is seeing some success in recovering higher fuel costs, Georgia Power is struggling with the opposite trend, compounding its financial exposure tied to the Vogtle project.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Fuel Cost Recovery: Duke Energy reported a $14 million increase in fuel cost recovery due to higher fuel prices and volumes in 2022.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's (SO) exposure to variable energy output from its solar and wind facilities influence NextEra Energy Resources' (NEER) long-term contracted energy sales strategy, given NEER's ownership of over 30,600 MW of net generation capacity and its focus on clean energy contracts?",
      "answer": "Southern Company (SO) sells energy from its solar and wind facilities primarily through long-term PPAs without capacity revenue, making its revenues dependent on energy output, which is subject to weather, equipment performance, and transmission constraints. NEER, which produces the majority of its electricity from clean and renewable sources and owns approximately 30,600 MW of net generating capacity, relies on long-term power sales agreements with utilities and industrial customers. Since NEER's strategy emphasizes contracted clean energy assets and hedges production variability, SO's exposure to variable output aligns with NEER's need to ensure stable, predictable energy delivery through its contracts. NEER\u2019s ownership structure and diversified generation mix, including wind, solar, and battery storage, helps mitigate the risk associated with variable output, supporting its long-term contracted sales model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO \u2192 Energy Output: Southern Company discloses that its solar and wind energy sales are dependent on the actual energy output of the facilities, which is subject to variability due to weather, equipment, and transmission factors.",
        "Hop 2: Energy Output \u2192 NEER: NEER, as a major clean energy wholesaler with over 30,600 MW of net generating capacity, produces the majority of its electricity from renewable sources and sells it through long-term power sales agreements, which require predictable energy output to meet contractual obligations.",
        "Hop 3: NEER \u2190 NEE: NEE reports that NEER includes a diversified mix of wind, solar, and battery storage assets, and uses long-term contracts and hedging strategies to manage variability in energy output, aligning with its strategy of stable, contracted cash flows."

      "question": "How does NEE's stake in Progress Energy influence its exposure to long-term nuclear decommissioning liabilities, given Progress Energy's significant share of the Total Asset Retirement Obligation compared to Duke Energy's overall obligations?",
      "answer": "NEE's stake in Progress Energy exposes it to a significant portion of long-term liabilities tied to nuclear decommissioning, as Progress Energy alone accounts for $4,156 million of the $7,046 million in nuclear decommissioning obligations reported under Duke Energy's consolidated operations. This liability is part of a larger Total Asset Retirement Obligation of $6,112 million attributed to Progress Energy, which includes $1,872 million for ash impoundment closures and $84 million for other obligations. Given that Duke Energy's consolidated Total Noncurrent Asset Retirement Obligation is $12,129 million, Progress Energy contributes $5,837 million, or nearly 48%, highlighting the material impact of its liabilities on any entity with a stake in it, such as NEE.",

        "Hop 1: NEE \u2192 Progress Energy: NEE has a stake in Progress Energy, which means it shares in the financial exposure and obligations tied to Progress Energy's operations.",

        "Hop 3: Total asset retirement obligation \u2190 DUK: Duke Energy reports a consolidated Total Noncurrent Asset Retirement Obligation of $12,129 million, with Progress Energy contributing nearly 48%, indicating the materiality of Progress Energy's liabilities within the larger corporate structure."

The cost estimates for Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are based on closure-in-place for all ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for others. These anticipated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are refined and compliance activities continue. Current estimates of these costs through 2026 are provided in the table below. Material expenditures in future years for ARO settlements will also be required for ash ponds, nuclear decommissioning (for Alabama Power and Georgia Power), and other liabilities reflected in the applicable Registrants' AROs, as discussed further in Note 6 to the financial statements.

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) has an interest rate hedge with a notional amount of $815 million, where it pays a fixed rate of 5.65% and receives a floating rate of 3.75% on 750 euros, maturing in April 2031, which resulted in a fair value loss of $38 million in 2024. Meanwhile, NextEra Energy (NEE) allocated $815 million to its NEER segment as part of its capital expenditures for 2026. This indicates that while DUK is managing interest rate risk on a significant fixed-rate obligation, NEE is deploying a similar dollar amount into growth initiatives under NEER, highlighting different strategic uses of capital in the same year.",

In comparison, Duke Energy\u2019s total noncurrent asset retirement obligation across all subsidiaries is $8,560 million, with $4,576 million allocated to nuclear decommissioning and $4,313 million to ash impoundment closures systemwide.

      "answer": "NEER estimates a total decommissioning cost of $9.8 billion for its nuclear plants, with a significant portion attributed to spent fuel storage costs that exceed expected refunds from the Department of Energy (DOE). In contrast, Duke Energy Florida has a dedicated Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund (NDTF) that is legally restricted for decommissioning purposes, and the entire balance of this fund can be used for license termination, spent fuel management, and site restoration at Crystal River Unit 3. This indicates Duke Energy has a more centralized and legally sanctioned financial mechanism in place for managing spent fuel and decommissioning costs, whereas NEER faces higher exposure due to DOE refund limitations.",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's continued investment in modernizing gas infrastructure compare to NextEra Energy Resources' (NEER) complete write-down of its gas infrastructure assets and its sharply declining capital expenditures on this segment through 2029?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) is actively modernizing its gas infrastructure as part of its long-term energy transition strategy, aligning with its objective to meet growing energy demand while ensuring reliability and affordability. In contrast, NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) wrote down its gas infrastructure assets entirely from $487 million in 2023 to $0 in 2024, signaling a strategic shift away from this asset class. This is further supported by NEER's capital expenditure projections, which show a steep decline from $3,945 million in 2025 to just $70 million by 2029 for NEER, indicating a rapid de-emphasis on gas infrastructure in favor of cleaner energy investments. The contrast reveals divergent strategic approaches: DUK continues to view gas infrastructure as a key component of its energy mix, while NEER is accelerating its exit from the sector.",

          "chunk_text": "## Duke E nergy Objectives - 2025 and B eyond\n\nAt D uke E nergy, our business strategy centers on m eeting growing energy needs and powering the m odern econom y, while delivering reliable, affordable and cleaner energy to our custom ers and com m unities. T o m eet these goals, we are safely transform ing and readying our system  by investing in secure and innovative technologies, m odernizing our gas and electric infrastructure and integrating efficiency and dem and m anagem ent program s. As we transition our business to m eet anticipated increased long-term  dem and while delivering more efficient sources of energy, we are focused on creating sustainable value for our custom ers and shareholders by leveraging business transform ation to exceed custom er expectations, optim izing investm ents to drive attractive shareholder returns and providing new product offerings and solutions that deliver growth and custom er value. T o achieve these objectives, we are partnering with stakeholders, cham pioning public policy that advances innovation and continuing to leverage regulatory m odels that support the delivery of reliable energy, tim ely cost recovery and affordable custom er rates.\n\n## Matters Impacting Future R esults\n\nThe m atters discussed herein could m aterially im pact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the D uke E nergy R egistrants and Business Segm ents.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\n## Coal Ash Costs\n\nI n April 2024, the E P A issued the 2024 C C R  R ule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 C C R  R ule by establishing regulatory requirem ents for inactive surface im poundm ents at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. D uke E nergy is participating in legal challenges to the 2024 C C R  R ule. Cost recovery for future expenditures is anticipated and will be pursued through the norm al ratem aking process with federal and state utility com m issions, which perm it recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with D uke E nergy's regulated operations. For m ore inform ation, see 'O ther M atters' and N otes 4 and 10 to the C onsolidated Financial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters\" and \"Asset R etirem ent O bligations.\"\n\n## Storm Cost Recovery\n\nFrom  August through October 2024, a series of m ajor storm  events occurred that resulted in significant dam age to utility infrastructure within our service territories and prim arily im pacted D uke E nergy C arolinas', D uke E nergy P rogress' and D uke E nergy F lorida's electric utility operations. H urricanes D ebby, H elene and M ilton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented dam age to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western N orth C arolina and upstate South Carolina. Appropriate storm  cost recovery m echanism s are in place to track and recover increm ental costs from  such events. F unding restoration activities and, in som e cases, the complete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this m agnitude has resulted in increm ental financing needs until cost recovery occurs and m ay im pact the near-term  results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the im pacted registrants.

D uke E nergy is analyzing the potential im pacts the rules could have on the C om pany, which could be m aterial and m ay influence the tim ing, nature, and m agnitude of future generation investm ents in our service territories. C ost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the norm al ratem aking process with federal and state utility commissions, which perm it recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with D uke E nergy's regulated operations. D uke E nergy is participating in legal challenges to the final rules. F or m ore inform ation, see \"O ther M atters.\"\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nThe Com pany continues to m onitor the ongoing stability of m arkets for key m aterials and public policy outcom es, including the potential im pacts from  possible new tariffs or other actions from  the new presidential adm inistration that could disrupt or im pact D uke E nergy's supply chain, future financial results, capital plan execution or the achievem ent of its energy transition.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants perform ed their annual goodwill im pairm ent tests as of August 31, 2024, as described in N ote 12 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"G oodwill and I ntangible Assets.\" As of this date, all of the D uke E nergy R egistrants' reporting units' estim ated fair values m aterially exceeded the carrying values except for the G U &amp;I reporting unit of D uke E nergy O hio.

      "question": "How does the $385 million annual revenue increase approved for Duke Energy Indiana compare with Alabama Power's 2024 revenue adjustments under Rate CNP Compliance and Rate ECR, and what does this imply about their respective regulatory strategies for cost recovery?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy Indiana received approval for a $385 million annual revenue increase in February 2025 to address inconsistencies in its rate case. In contrast, Alabama Power had a projected under recovered retail revenue requirement of $50 million under Rate CNP Compliance for 2024 and experienced a $135 million annual decrease in revenue from Rate ECR effective in July 2024. This indicates that Duke Energy Indiana is proactively adjusting rates to correct miscalculations and align with regulatory findings, while Alabama Power is managing under recoveries and regulatory adjustments within existing mechanisms, reflecting a more reactive approach to cost recovery.",

An order for the rate case was issued by the IU R C  on January 29, 2025, and revised F ebruary 3, 2025, which authorized an R O E  of 9.75%, an equity ratio of 53% and an annual revenue increase of $296 m illion. Based on review of these orders, D uke E nergy Indiana identified an inconsistency in the calculation of operating revenues before the effect of trackers. O n February 7, 2025, D uke E nergy Indiana m ade a com pliance filing in accordance with the IU R C 's findings in its order and addressing the identified inconsistencies. T he com pliance filing also clarified the annual revenue increase was approxim ately $385 m illion. Additionally, on F ebruary 18, 2025, one industrial custom er subm itted a filing requesting the IU R C  to clarify its revenue allocation in these proceedings. O n F ebruary 25, 2025, the IU R C  approved D uke E nergy Indiana's com pliance filing subject to refund, pending the outcom e of the petition for rehearing.

T he C ayuga CC P roject is proposed to be constructed on the sam e site as the retiring C ayuga coal-fired steam  units with a winter rating of 1,005 M W . T he C ayuga C C  P roject will result in an increm ental 471 M W  for the D uke E nergy Indiana system  and will allow D uke E nergy Indiana to avoid expected m aintenance and environm ental com pliance costs needed for the coal units to continue operating. T he estim ated cost of the C ayuga C C  project is $2.97 billion, plus AF U D C  and project reserves. D uke E nergy Indiana has proposed recovery of certain costs of the facility during construction, including AF U D C , through construction work in progress ratem aking through a proposed generation cost adjustm ent tracker m echanism  and estim ates an average retail rate im pact of approxim ately 5.4% during construction.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nPower's revenues or net income but will affect annual cash flow. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2022 through 2024 and no adjustment is expected for 2025. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP PPA balance of $84 million and $103 million, respectively, of which $17 million and $18 million, respectively, is included in other regulatory assets, current and $67 million and $85 million, respectively, is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Alabama Power's balance sheets.\n\n## Rate CNP Compliance\n\nRate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to factors that are calculated and submitted to the Alabama PSC by December 1 with rates effective for the following calendar year. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factors will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's revenues or net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation generally will have no effect on net income.\n\nIn December 2022, December 2023, and November 2024, Alabama Power submitted calculations to the Alabama PSC associated with its cost of complying with governmental mandates for the following calendar year, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. The 2022 filing reflected a $255 million, or 3.7%, annual increase effective with January 2023 billings, primarily due to updated depreciation rates. The 2023 filing reflected a $23 million, or 0.3%, annual decrease effective with January 2024 billings. The 2024 filing reflected a projected under recovered retail revenue requirement of $50 million. On December 3, 2024, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order requiring Alabama Power to leave the 2024 Rate CNP Compliance factors in effect for 2025, with any prior year under collected amount deemed recovered before any current year amounts are recovered, and any remaining under recovered amounts reflected in the 2025 filing.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP Compliance balance of $35 million which is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Alabama Power's balance sheets. At December 31, 2023, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP Compliance balance of $33 million, of which $8 million is included in other regulatory assets, current and $25 million is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Alabama Power's balance sheets.\n\n## Rate CNP Depreciation\n\nIn 2022, the Alabama PSC approved Rate CNP Depreciation, which allows Alabama Power to recover changes in depreciation resulting from updates to certain depreciation rates, ex cluding any depreciation recovered through Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, or costs associated with the capitalization of asset retirement costs. Rate CNP Depreciation resulted in an annual revenue increase of approximately $318 million, or 4.6%, effective with January 2023 billings. No adjustments to Rate CNP Depreciation occurred during 2024 and no adjustment is expected for 2025.\n\n## Rate ECR\n\nRate ECR recovers Alabama Power's retail energy costs based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered balance. Revenues recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed gives rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing rates is required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's net income but will impact the related operating cash flows. The Alabama PSC may approve billing rates under Rate ECR of up to 5.910 cents per KWH.\n\nThe Alabama PSC approved adjustments to Rate ECR from 1.960 cents per KWH to 2.557 cents per KWH, or approximately $310 million annually, effective with August 2022 billings and from 2.557 cents per KWH to 3.510 cents per KWH, or approximately $500 million annually, effective with December 2022 billings. In November 2023, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from 3.510 cents per KWH to 3.270 cents per KWH, or approximately $126 million annually, effective with December 2023 billings. On May 7, 2024, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from 3.270 cents per KWH to 3.015 cents per KWH, or approximately $135 million annually, effective with July 2024 billings. On December 3, 2024, the Alabama PSC approved an additional reduction to Rate ECR from 3.015 cents per KWH to 2.600 cents per KWH, or",

      "question": "How do the annual decommissioning cost estimates for nuclear plants disclosed by SO compare to NEER's long-term asset retirement obligations, particularly in relation to the expected timing and magnitude of decommissioning liabilities?",
      "answer": "Southern Company (SO) discloses an $8 million annual decommissioning cost for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under ratemaking, effective August 1, 2023, and May 1, 2024, respectively. NEER, on the other hand, records liabilities for decommissioning based on the present value of expected costs, with its nuclear plant AROs at $646 million as of December 31, 2024, and an estimated ultimate decommissioning cost of $9.8 billion (or $2.2 billion in 2024 dollars). NEER's expected decommissioning payments for NEER specifically are $3,945 million in 2025, declining to $370 million thereafter, indicating a front-loaded liability recognition compared to SO's steady annual rate case allowance. This suggests different regulatory and accounting treatments for decommissioning liabilities between the two companies, with NEER recognizing a much larger present value upfront and SO aligning costs annually with rate recovery.",

Effective May 1, 2024, as approved under the Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking is $8 million for Plant V ogtle Unit 4. See Note 2 under \"G eorgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Regulatory Matters\" for additional information.\n\n## 7. CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Registrants may hold ownership interests in a number of business ventures with varying ownership structures. Partnership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if each entity is a V IE. If a venture is a V IE for which a Registrant is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. The Registrants reassess the conclusion as to whether an entity is a VIE upon certain occurrences, which are deemed reconsideration events.\n\nFor entities that are not determined to be VIEs, the Registrants evaluate whether they have control or significant influence over the investee to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation. Generally, entities under the control of a Registrant are consolidated, and entities over which a Registrant can exert significant influence, but which a Registrant does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\nInvestments accounted for under the equity method are recorded within equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the balance sheets and, for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, the equity income is recorded within earnings from equity method investments in the statements of income. See \"SEGCO\" and \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Southern Company\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Southern Holdings had equity method investments totaling $128 million and $126 million, respectively, primarily related to investments in venture capital funds focused on energy and utility investments. Earnings/losses from these investments were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\n## SEGCO\n\nAlabama Power and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns electric generating units at Plant Gaston with a total rated capacity of 1,020 MWs, as well as associated transmission facilities. Retirement of SEGCO's generating units is currently expected to occur by December 31, 2028. However, Alabama Power, in conjunction with Georgia Power, is evaluating extending the operation of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond the indicated retirement date. See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Integrated Resource Plans - 2025 IRP\" for additional information. Alabama Power and Georgia Power account for SEGCO using the equity method; Southern Company consolidates SEGCO. The capacity of these units is sold equally to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. Alabama Power and Georgia Power make payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and an ROE. The share of purchased power included in purchased power, affiliates in the statements of income totaled $115 million in 2024, $112 million in 2023, and $124 million in 2022 for Alabama Power and $118 million in 2024, $115 million in 2023, and $127 million in 2022 for G eorgia Power.\n\nSEGCO paid dividends of $20 million in 2024, $25 million in 2023, and $14 million in 2022, one half of which were paid to each of Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each recognize 50% of SEGCO's net income.\n\nAlabama Power, which owns and operates a generating unit adjacent to the SEGCO generating units, has a joint ownership agreement with SEGCO for the ownership of an associated gas pipeline. Alabama Power owns 14% of the pipeline with the remaining 86% owned by SEGCO.\n\nSee Note 3 under \"Guarantees\" for additional information regarding guarantees of Alabama Power and Georgia Power related to SEGCO.\n\n## Southern Power\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nSouthern Power has certain subsidiaries that are determined to be VIEs. Southern Power is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it controls the most significant activities of the V IEs, including operating and maintaining the respective assets, and has the obligation to absorb ex pected losses of these VIEs to the extent of its equity interests.\n\n## SP Solar and SP Wind\n\nSP Solar is owned by Southern Power and a limited partner. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power is the general partner and holds a 1% ownership interest, and another wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Power owns a 66% ownership interest. The",

NEER's portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $9.8 billion, or $2.2 billion ex pressed in 2024 dollars. A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the A ROs for dismantling certain of NEER's wind facilities approximated $329 million and $296 million, respectively, and for dismantling certain of NEER's solar facilities approximated $315 million and $256 million, respectively.\n\nSee Note 1 - A sset Retirement Obligations and - Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other A ccrued A sset Removal Costs and Note 11.\n\n## Regulatory Accounting\n\nCertain of NEE's businesses are subject to rate regulation which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation for details regarding NEE's regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nRegulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn (pay) a return on investment during the recovery period.",

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's $32 million fair value gain from interest rate derivatives in 2023 compare with the $89 million maximum annual NEIL assessment risk facing Georgia Power, and what does this contrast suggest about Southern Company's consolidated risk management strategy across its operating subsidiaries?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy reported a $32 million fair value gain from its interest rate derivatives in 2023, reflecting short-term financial benefits from its hedging activities. In contrast, Georgia Power faces a potential $89 million maximum annual assessment under its NEIL insurance policies, which represents a contingent liability exposure rather than an actual realized gain or loss. This contrast highlights how Southern Company manages different types of financial risks across its subsidiaries \u2014 using derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure at Duke Energy, while being subject to retrospective insurance assessments at Georgia Power that could materially affect its financial condition. The consolidated entity must balance these offsetting dynamics in its overall risk and capital management approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Fair Value Gain (Loss): Duke Energy disclosed a $32 million fair value gain from its interest rate derivatives in 2023, indicating realized short-term benefits from its hedging strategy.",
        "Hop 2: Fair Value Gain (Loss) \u2192 Georgia Power: Southern Company's subsidiaries, including Duke Energy and Georgia Power, are part of a consolidated risk management framework that includes derivative and insurance strategies.",
        "Hop 3: Georgia Power \u2190 SO: Georgia Power is subject to a maximum annual NEIL assessment of $89 million, representing a contingent liability risk tied to nuclear insurance assessments."

This indicates that while NEE is making significant but relatively smaller-scale investments in new generation, SO maintains a much larger existing generation asset footprint, suggesting differing scales and potentially different strategic focuses in their power generation infrastructure development.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas reported a fair value loss of $79 million related to its interest rate hedges, while DUK recorded a fair value gain of $32 million across its hedging activities. This contrast suggests that Southern Company Gas was more exposed to rising interest rates due to its hedging strategy, which involved receiving fixed rates and paying floating rates tied to SOFR. Conversely, DUK's strategy\u2014locking in fixed pay rates (e.g., 4.75% and 5.31%) while receiving floating rates based on euros\u2014benefited from rate increases, resulting in gains. These differences indicate divergent risk management approaches: Southern Company Gas assumed more interest rate risk, while DUK effectively mitigated it through favorable fixed-rate positions.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Fair Value Gain (Loss): DUK disclosed a total fair value gain of $32 million in 2023 from its fair value hedges, which involved fixed pay rates and floating euro receipts.",

        "Hop 3: Southern Company Gas \u2190 SO: SO's disclosures show that Southern Company Gas is a distinct segment with its own hedging profile, and the $79 million loss is specific to its interest rate risk management strategy."

      "answer": "Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, saw a significant increase in fuel cost recovery in 2023, contributing to a $714 million rise in operating cash flow compared to 2022. This reflects improved alignment between fuel-related revenues and costs. In contrast, Duke Energy experienced a mismatch in 2022 due to rising fuel and commodity prices, leading to a large undercollection that was deferred into regulatory assets. Duke recovered $1.5 billion of these deferred fuel costs in 2023 and expects balances to normalize by the end of 2024, indicating a more volatile but eventually stabilizing fuel cost recovery process.",

        "Hop 1: Southern Company (SO) \u2192 Georgia Power: Georgia Power is a Southern Company subsidiary and its financial performance contributes directly to Southern Company's consolidated results.",
        "Hop 2: Georgia Power \u2192 Fuel Cost Recovery: Georgia Power's 2023 operating cash flow increased by $714 million due to higher fuel cost recovery.",
        "Hop 3: Fuel Cost Recovery \u2190 Duke Energy (DUK): Duke Energy deferred large fuel cost undercollections in 2022, later recovering $1.5 billion in 2023, showing a different timing and volatility in fuel cost recovery."

      "answer": "NEE reported $1,199 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities, while the Piedmont segment at Duke Energy had $118 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities. This indicates that NEE has a significantly larger long-term financial exposure tied to derivative contracts compared to the Piedmont segment. This contrast suggests that NEE may face greater long-term obligations and risks associated with its derivative positions, which could affect its financial flexibility and risk profile over time.",

      "answer": "NEE's $782 million capital allocation to Gulf Power in 2021 highlights a significant investment in expanding or maintaining Gulf Power's infrastructure, which is directly tied to FPL's broader segment strategy. This is underscored by the $2,688 million of goodwill attributed to Gulf Power within FPL's segment portfolio, indicating that Gulf Power is a strategically valuable asset with long-term earning potential. Southern Company's operational integration with Gulf Power, evidenced by intercompany agreements such as the Intercompany Interchange Contract and Appendix A thereto, suggests that Gulf Power operates within a coordinated regional energy framework, further justifying the capital investment and goodwill value as part of a broader integrated utility strategy.",

      "answer": "Georgia Power has a short-term cash flow hedge of $150 million maturing in April 2024, indicating a near-term focus on managing interest rate exposure for forecasted debt. In contrast, Duke Energy\u2019s fair value hedges, totaling $1,182 million and maturing in 2028 and 2034, suggest a long-term strategy to lock in interest rates on existing debt. This contrast reflects differing risk management approaches: Georgia Power prioritizes near-term interest rate volatility protection, while Duke Energy focuses on long-term rate certainty across its debt portfolio.",

      "answer": "Southern Company capitalizes development costs only once a project is deemed 'probable of completion,' which is determined based on economic viability, off-take agreements, and regulatory approvals. Costs incurred before this determination are expensed. In contrast, NEER capitalizes development costs once it is probable that such costs will be realized through construction or sale of development rights, suggesting a potentially lower threshold for capitalization. NEER had $831 million in capitalized development costs at the end of 2021, which aligns with its aggressive capital deployment strategy reflected in its $4.4 billion capital expenditure for 2022. This indicates that NEER may adopt a more forward-leaning posture in capitalizing development costs relative to Southern Company's more conditional approach.",

          "chunk_text": "\nIntangible liabilities of $91 million recorded under acquisition accounting for transportation contracts at Southern Company Gas were fully amortized at December 31, 2019.\n\n## Acquisition Accounting\n\nAt the time of an acquisition, management will assess whether acquired assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, operating results from the date of acquisition are included in the acquiring entity's financial statements. The purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired.\n\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and management may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.\n\nHistorically, contingent consideration primarily relates to fixed amounts due to the seller once an acquired construction project is placed in service. For contingent consideration with variable payments, management fair values the arrangement with any changes recorded in the statements of income. See Note 13 for additional fair value information.\n\n## Development Costs\n\nFor Southern Power, development costs are capitalized once a project is probable of completion, primarily based on a review of its economics and operational feasibility, as well as the status of power off-take agreements and regulatory approvals, if applicable. Southern Power's capitalized development costs are included in CWIP on the balance sheets. All of Southern Power's development costs incurred prior to the determination that a project is probable of completion are expensed as incurred and included in other operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income. If it is determined that a project is no longer probable of completion, any of Southern Power's capitalized development costs are expensed and included in other operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income.\n\n## Long-Term Service Agreements\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance support for certain of their generating facilities. The LTSAs cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment,",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nelect a cash grant (convertible investment tax credits (ITCs)) for certain renewable energy property (renewable property). Convertible ITCs are recorded as a reduction in property, plant and equipment on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated life of the related property. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, convertible ITCs, net of amortization, were approximately $755 million ($116 million at FPL) and $791 million ($122 million at FPL).\n\nDepreciation  of  FPL's  electric  property  is  provided  on  a  straight-line  basis,  primarily  over  its  average  remaining  useful  life.  FPL  includes  in depreciation expense a provision for electric generation plant dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, accretion related to asset retirement obligations  (see  Decommissioning  of  Nuclear  Plants,  Dismantlement  of  Plants  and  Other  Accrued  Asset  Removal  Costs  below)  and  storm recovery amortization. For substantially all of FPL's property, depreciation studies are performed periodically and filed with the FPSC which result in updated depreciation rates. As part of the 2021 rate agreement, the FPSC approved new unified depreciation rates which became effective January 1, 2022. These new rates are expected to decrease depreciation expense. Reserve amortization is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets at December 31, 2021 and noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020 on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. The FPL segment used available reserve amortization to offset all of the storm restoration costs that were expensed during 2019 through 2021. See Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below. FPL files a twelve-month forecast with the FPSC each year which contains a regulatory ROE intended to be earned based on the best information FPL has at that time assuming normal weather. This forecast establishes a targeted regulatory ROE. In order to earn the targeted regulatory  ROE in each reporting period subject to the conditions of the effective rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&amp;M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items is adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization or its reversal to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. See Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 above.\n\nNEER's electric plant in service and other property less salvage value, if any, are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. NEER reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. NEER's oil and gas production assets are accounted  for  under  the  successful  efforts  method.  Depletion  expenses  for  the  acquisition  of  reserve  rights  and  development  costs  are recognized using the unit of production method.\n\nNuclear Fuel - FPL and NEER have several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel. See Note 15 - Contracts. FPL's and NEER's nuclear fuel costs are charged to fuel expense on a unit of production method.\n\nConstruction Activity - Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is a noncash item which represents the allowed cost of capital, including an ROE, used to finance construction projects. FPL records the portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds as a reduction of interest expense and the remainder as other income. FPSC rules limit the recording of AFUDC to projects that have an estimated cost in excess of 0.5% prior to 2021 and 0.4% beginning in 2021 of a utility's plant in service balance and require more than one year to complete. FPSC rules allow construction projects below the applicable threshold as a component of rate base.\n\nFPL's  construction  work  in  progress  includes  construction  materials,  progress  payments  on  major  equipment  contracts,  engineering  costs, AFUDC and other costs directly associated with the construction of various projects. Upon completion of the projects, these costs are transferred to electric utility plant in service and other property. Capitalized costs associated with construction activities are charged to O&amp;M expenses when recoverability is no longer probable.\n\nNEER capitalizes project development costs once it is probable that such costs will be realized through the ultimate construction of the related asset or sale of development rights. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NEER's capitalized development costs totaled approximately $831 million and $571 million, respectively, which are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. These costs include land rights and other third-party costs directly associated with the development of a new project. Upon commencement of construction, these costs either are transferred to construction work in progress or remain in other assets, depending upon the nature of the cost. Capitalized development costs are charged to O&amp;M expenses when it is probable that these costs will not be realized.\n\nNEER's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, third-party engineering costs,  capitalized  interest  and  other  costs  directly  associated  with  the  construction  and  development  of  various  projects.  Interest  expense allocated from NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH) to NEER is based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership  interests  sold  by  NextEra  Energy  Resources'  subsidiaries.  Upon  commencement  of  project  operation,  costs  associated  with construction work in progress are transferred to electric plant in service and other property. In 2019, NEER determined it was no longer moving forward with the construction of a 220 MW wind facility due to unresolved permitting issues. NEE recorded charges of approximately $72 million ($54 million after tax), which are included in taxes other than income taxes and other - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to the write-off of capitalized construction costs.",

      "answer": "The $89 million increase in Gulf Power's operating expenses\u2014driven by higher fuel, purchased power, and interchange costs\u2014was partially offset by higher fuel cost recovery revenues.

Meanwhile, NEE\u2019s 2022 10-K shows that such costs are typically recovered in full through cost recovery clauses, which include fuel, purchased power, and interchange expenses.

      "question": "What does the difference in disclosure specificity around pension-related regulatory assets between Alabama Power's $173 million recognized amount and NextEra Energy's general reference to unrecognized pension costs suggest about their respective regulatory accounting strategies?",
      "answer": "Alabama Power, as part of Southern Company, disclosed a specific pension-related regulatory asset of $173 million at December 31, 2023, associated with unamortized amounts from Southern Company Gas' pension plans. This level of specificity indicates a transparent and segmented approach to pension cost recognition, particularly for legacy acquisitions. In contrast, NextEra Energy's disclosure only references 'unrecognized amounts' included in regulatory assets without quantifying them, suggesting a more consolidated or deferred recognition strategy. The difference implies that Southern Company (via Alabama Power) may be more proactive in isolating and disclosing pension liabilities tied to specific business units or acquisition histories, while NextEra Energy appears to manage pension cost recognition in a broader regulatory context, potentially aligning with long-term rate recovery mechanisms rather than itemized disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO \u2192 Alabama Power: Southern Company's 2023 10-K reveals that Alabama Power holds $173 million in pension-related regulatory assets tied to unamortized amounts from Southern Company Gas' pension plans prior to acquisition.",
        "Hop 2: Alabama Power \u2192 Prepaid Pension Costs: Alabama Power specifically discloses prepaid pension and other postretirement benefit costs on its balance sheet, indicating a segmented and transparent regulatory accounting approach.",
        "Hop 3: Prepaid Pension Costs \u2190 NEE: NextEra Energy also reports pension-related regulatory assets but does not quantify them, instead referring generally to 'unrecognized amounts' yet to be recognized as components of net prepaid pension benefit costs."

      "question": "How does the impact of Alabama Power's Rate CNP Compliance and Rate CNP Depreciation adjustments on its 2024 annual revenue compare to Duke Energy Indiana's recently approved $385 million annual revenue increase?",
      "answer": "Alabama Power experienced a $255 million (3.7%) annual revenue increase in 2023 due to Rate CNP Compliance and a separate $318 million (4.6%) increase from Rate CNP Depreciation, both of which are regulatory mechanisms to recover compliance and depreciation costs. These adjustments reflect Alabama Power's cost-recovery filings tied to regulatory mandates and updated depreciation rates. In contrast, Duke Energy Indiana's 2025 compliance filing clarified an annual revenue increase of approximately $385 million, significantly higher than Alabama Power\u2019s individual adjustments. This comparison highlights the differing regulatory environments and cost-recovery needs between the two utilities, with Duke Energy Indiana facing higher revenue requirements in its rate case outcome.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nPower's revenues or net income but will affect annual cash flow. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2022 through 2024 and no adjustment is expected for 2025. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP PPA balance of $84 million and $103 million, respectively, of which $17 million and $18 million, respectively, is included in other regulatory assets, current and $67 million and $85 million, respectively, is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Alabama Power's balance sheets.\n\n## Rate CNP Compliance\n\nRate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to factors that are calculated and submitted to the Alabama PSC by December 1 with rates effective for the following calendar year. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factors will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's revenues or net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation generally will have no effect on net income.\n\nIn December 2022, December 2023, and November 2024, Alabama Power submitted calculations to the Alabama PSC associated with its cost of complying with governmental mandates for the following calendar year, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. The 2022 filing reflected a $255 million, or 3.7%, annual increase effective with January 2023 billings, primarily due to updated depreciation rates. The 2023 filing reflected a $23 million, or 0.3%, annual decrease effective with January 2024 billings. The 2024 filing reflected a projected under recovered retail revenue requirement of $50 million. On December 3, 2024, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order requiring Alabama Power to leave the 2024 Rate CNP Compliance factors in effect for 2025, with any prior year under collected amount deemed recovered before any current year amounts are recovered, and any remaining under recovered amounts reflected in the 2025 filing.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP Compliance balance of $35 million which is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Alabama Power's balance sheets. At December 31, 2023, Alabama Power had an under recovered Rate CNP Compliance balance of $33 million, of which $8 million is included in other regulatory assets, current and $25 million is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Alabama Power's balance sheets.\n\n## Rate CNP Depreciation\n\nIn 2022, the Alabama PSC approved Rate CNP Depreciation, which allows Alabama Power to recover changes in depreciation resulting from updates to certain depreciation rates, ex cluding any depreciation recovered through Rate CNP New Plant, Rate CNP Compliance, or costs associated with the capitalization of asset retirement costs. Rate CNP Depreciation resulted in an annual revenue increase of approximately $318 million, or 4.6%, effective with January 2023 billings. No adjustments to Rate CNP Depreciation occurred during 2024 and no adjustment is expected for 2025.\n\n## Rate ECR\n\nRate ECR recovers Alabama Power's retail energy costs based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered balance. Revenues recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed gives rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing rates is required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's net income but will impact the related operating cash flows. The Alabama PSC may approve billing rates under Rate ECR of up to 5.910 cents per KWH.\n\nThe Alabama PSC approved adjustments to Rate ECR from 1.960 cents per KWH to 2.557 cents per KWH, or approximately $310 million annually, effective with August 2022 billings and from 2.557 cents per KWH to 3.510 cents per KWH, or approximately $500 million annually, effective with December 2022 billings. In November 2023, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from 3.510 cents per KWH to 3.270 cents per KWH, or approximately $126 million annually, effective with December 2023 billings. On May 7, 2024, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from 3.270 cents per KWH to 3.015 cents per KWH, or approximately $135 million annually, effective with July 2024 billings. On December 3, 2024, the Alabama PSC approved an additional reduction to Rate ECR from 3.015 cents per KWH to 2.600 cents per KWH, or",

      "question": "How does the relative allocation to municipal bonds within their respective non-qualified deferred tax fund (NDTF) investment portfolios compare between Duke Energy (DUK) and Georgia Power in their latest disclosed financials, and what might this suggest about their differing approaches to tax-advantaged fixed income investments?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy held $306 million in municipal bonds as part of its $4,637 million NDTF investment portfolio in 2024, representing 6.6% of the total. Georgia Power held $47 million in municipal bonds as part of its $1,176 million NDTF investment portfolio in 2023, representing 4.0% of the total. This suggests Duke Energy may place greater emphasis on tax-exempt municipal bonds as part of its deferred tax investment strategy compared to Georgia Power.",

      "question": "How does the $43 million annual base rate increase approved for Virginia Natural Gas in September 2021 relate to Duke Energy's use of interim rates in its Tennessee and North Carolina rate cases, considering Southern Company's broader investment strategy in the SAVE program through Virginia Natural Gas?",
      "answer": "The $43 million annual base rate increase approved for Virginia Natural Gas in September 2021, which included $14 million tied to the SAVE program, reflects Southern Company's strategic investment in infrastructure modernization and regulatory mechanisms to recover capital expenditures. This mirrors Duke Energy's use of interim rates in Tennessee and North Carolina to recover costs from infrastructure upgrades, such as the $26 million interim rate increase in Tennessee and the $97 million adjusted request in North Carolina. Both companies leveraged interim or stipulated rate mechanisms to ensure timely recovery of investments while navigating regulatory timelines, aligning with Southern Company's broader approach to funding programs like SAVE, which had cumulative expenditures of $342 million as of 2021.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Interim Rates: Duke Energy implemented interim rates in Tennessee and North Carolina to recover infrastructure upgrade costs, including a $26 million interim rate increase in Tennessee and a $97 million adjusted request in North Carolina.",
        "Hop 2: Interim Rates \u2192 Virginia Natural Gas: Virginia Natural Gas implemented a $43 million annual base rate increase, effective November 2020 on an interim basis, later finalized in September 2021, with refunds issued after final approval.",
        "Hop 3: Virginia Natural Gas \u2190 SO: Southern Company invested $342 million cumulatively through 2021 in Virginia Natural Gas' SAVE program, a key component of its infrastructure modernization strategy, which was partially funded through the approved rate increase."

The rate increase is driven by significant infrastructure upgrade investments since Piedmont's previous rate case. Approximately half of the plant additions being added to rate base are categories of capital investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was approved in 2013. Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $26 million in December 2020. As authorized under Tennessee law, Piedmont implemented interim rates on January 2, 2021, at the level requested in its adjusted request. A settlement reached with the Tennessee Consumer Advocate in mid-January was approved by the TPUC on February 16, 2021. The settlement results in an increase of revenues of approximately $16 million and an ROE of 9.8%. Revised customer rates became effective on January 2, 2021. Piedmont refunded customers the difference between bills previously rendered under interim rates and such bills if rendered under approved rates, plus interest in April 2021.\n\n## 2021 North Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn March 22, 2021, Piedmont filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $109 million, which represents an approximate 10% increase in retail revenues. The rate increase is driven by customer growth and significant infrastructure upgrade investments (plant additions) since the last general rate case. Approximately 70% of the plant additions being rolled into rate base are categories of plant investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was originally approved as part of the 2013 North Carolina Rate Case. On July 28, 2021, Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $97 million.\n\nOn September 7, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff, the Carolina Utility Customers Association, Inc. and the Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates IV filed a Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Stipulation), which is subject to review and approval by the NCUC, resolving most issues between these parties. Major components of the Stipulation include:\n\n- A return on equity of 9.6% and a capital structure of 51.6% equity and 48.4% debt;\n- Continuation of the IMR mechanism and margin decoupling; and\n- A base rate increase of approximately $67 million, subject to completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project.\n\nAn evidentiary hearing to review the Stipulation and other issues concluded on September 9, 2021. On October 12, 2021, Piedmont notified the NCUC of its intent to implement the stipulated rates effective November 1, 2021, on a temporary basis and subject to refund. On October 18, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff filed supplemental testimony attesting to the completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project and to the propriety of including the capital investment for these two projects in this proceeding. On January 6, 2022, the NCUC issued an order approving the Stipulation. No refunds need to be rendered to customers arising from Piedmont's implementation of interim rates.\n\n## OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC\n\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP pipeline) was planned to be an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia to North Carolina. Duke Energy indirectly owns a 47% interest, which is accounted for as an equity method investment through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment.\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty created by various legal rulings, the potential impact on the cost and schedule for the project, the ongoing legal challenges and the risk of additional legal challenges and delays through the construction period and Dominion's decision to sell substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, Duke Energy's Board of Directors and management decided that it was not prudent to continue to invest in the project. On July 5, 2020, Duke Energy and Dominion announced the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project.\n\nAs part of the pretax charges to earnings of approximately $2.1 billion recorded in June 2020, within Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates on the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations, Duke Energy established liabilities related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately $855 million to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee. At December 31, 2021, there is $47 million and $53 million within Other Current Liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities, respectively, in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment. The liabilities represent Duke Energy's obligation of approximately $100 million to satisfy remaining ARO requirements to restore construction sites.\n\nSee Notes 7 and 12 for additional information regarding this transaction.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nOn February 16, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia PSC staff establishing a long-range comprehensive planning process. Under the terms of the stipulation, Atlanta Gas Light was required to develop and file at least triennially an Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan (i-CDP). Each i-CDP will include a 10-year forecast of interstate and intrastate capacity asset requirements, including a detailed plan for the first three years consistent with Atlanta Gas Light's current capacity supply plan, and a 10-year projection of capital budgets and related operations and maintenance spending. Recovery of the related revenue requirements will be included in either subsequent annual GRAM filings or a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects.\n\nOn April 28, 2021, Atlanta Gas Light filed its first i-CDP with the Georgia PSC, which includes a series of ongoing and proposed pipeline safety, reliability, and growth programs for the next 10 years (2022 through 2031), as well as the required capital investments and related costs to implement the programs. The i-CDP reflected capital investments totaling approximately $0.5 billion to $0.6 billion annually.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved an October 14, 2021 joint stipulation agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC, under which, for the years 2022 through 2024, Atlanta Gas Light will incrementally reduce its combined GRAM and System Reinforcement Rider request by 10% through Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM mechanism, or $5 million for 2022. The stipulation agreement also provides for $1.7 billion of total capital investment for the years 2022 through 2024. Also on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's amended annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of $43 million effective January 1, 2022.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nOn September 14, 2021, the Virginia Commission approved a stipulation agreement related to Virginia Natural Gas' June 2020 general rate case filing, which allows for a $43 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $14 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, based on a ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 51.9%. Interim rate adjustments became effective as of November 1, 2020, subject to refund, based on Virginia Natural Gas' original request for an increase of approximately $50 million. Refunds to customers related to the difference between the approved rates and the interim rates were completed during the fourth quarter 2021.\n\n## Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs\n\nAs discussed under \"Utility Regulation and Rate Design,\" the natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms to recover bad debt expense, which helped mitigate potential increases in bad debt expense as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Deferred incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic were immaterial for Virginia Natural Gas.\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nIn April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Atlanta Gas Light to continue its previous, voluntary suspension of customer disconnections. In June 2020, the Georgia PSC ordered Atlanta Gas Light to resume customer disconnections beginning July 2020, with exceptions for customers still covered by a shelter-in-place order. All suspensions for customer disconnections were lifted in October 2020. The orders provide the Marketers, including SouthStar, with a mechanism to receive credits from Atlanta Gas Light for the base rates it charged to the Marketers of non-paying customers during the suspension. Atlanta Gas Light will begin recovering these credits through GRAM rates effective January 1, 2023.\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Illinois Commission issued an order directing utilities to cease disconnections for non-payment and to suspend the imposition of late payment fees or penalties. In June 2020, the Illinois Commission approved a stipulation pursuant to which Nicor Gas and other utilities in Illinois would provide more flexible credit and collection procedures to assist customers with financial hardship and which authorizes a special purpose rider for recovery of the following COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts: incremental costs directly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, net of the offset for COVID-19 pandemic-related credits received, foregone late fees, foregone reconnection charges, and the costs associated with a bill payment assistance program. Nicor Gas resumed late payment fees in July 2020 and, on October 1, 2020, began recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts through the special purpose rider, which will continue over a 24-month period. On March 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a phased-in schedule for disconnections related to non-payment. Nicor Gas began certain disconnections in late April 2021 and resumed normal disconnections in June 2021. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Nicor Gas' related regulatory asset was $5 million and $9 million, respectively.",

      "question": "How might Southern Company's centralized economic dispatch strategy in its power pool, which included Gulf Power under transitional terms that required adherence to shared cost and revenue provisions, have influenced NextEra Energy's decision to exit the pool, especially given Gulf Power's $782 million in capital expenditures in 2021 that reflected continued infrastructure investment under those terms?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's centralized economic dispatch strategy was designed to optimize the lowest-cost energy resources for each company's own customers, with excess energy shared across the pool under the IIC, including cost and revenue sharing provisions. Gulf Power, although no longer a subsidiary, remained under transitional terms in the IIC following its sale in 2019, which meant it still had to operate within these shared coordination mechanisms. Given Gulf Power's $782 million in capital expenditures in 2021, it was continuing to invest in its infrastructure under the constraints of those transitional terms. This likely limited Gulf Power\u2019s operational flexibility and aligned it more closely with Southern Company\u2019s system-wide optimization goals rather than pursuing independent strategies. NextEra Energy, parent company of Gulf Power, may have viewed this lack of autonomy and shared dispatch control as misaligned with its broader strategic goals, prompting its decision on December 21, 2021, to provide a 180-day notice of its intention to leave the Southern Company power pool.",

The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the traditional electric operating companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - OVERVIEW - \"Business Activities\" in Item 7 herein.\n\nSouthern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company power pool.

For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - OVERVIEW - \"Business Activities\" in Item 7 herein.\n\nSouthern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue natural gas and renewable generation facilities, either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2021, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with various partners, totaled 12,446 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,066 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries).

      "answer": "NEER's capitalized development costs increased from $571 million in 2020 to $831 million in 2021, a $260 million rise, indicating a significant ramp-up in early-stage project investments. This increase, combined with the $72 million write-off in 2019 for a wind project abandoned due to permitting issues, suggests that NEER may apply less rigid thresholds for capitalizing development costs, potentially taking on more speculative projects. In contrast, Southern Power capitalizes development costs only once a project is deemed 'probable of completion,' based on factors like economic viability, off-take agreements, and regulatory approvals. If a project no longer meets this threshold, previously capitalized costs are expensed. This structured approach implies a more conservative and risk-mitigated stance toward development spending compared to NEER\u2019s, which may pursue a broader pipeline with higher upfront risk but potentially greater long-term upside.",

        "Hop 2: NEER \u2192 Capitalized Development Costs: NEER capitalizes development costs once project completion is deemed probable and expenses them if the project is abandoned or no longer viable, as seen with the 2019 wind facility write-off.",
        "Hop 3: Capitalized Development Costs \u2190 SO: Southern Power capitalizes development costs only when a project is deemed 'probable of completion,' factoring in economics, off-take agreements, and regulatory status, with expensing triggered if that probability no longer holds."

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nelect a cash grant (convertible investment tax credits (ITCs)) for certain renewable energy property (renewable property). Convertible ITCs are recorded as a reduction in property, plant and equipment on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated life of the related property. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, convertible ITCs, net of amortization, were approximately $755 million ($116 million at FPL) and $791 million ($122 million at FPL).\n\nDepreciation  of  FPL's  electric  property  is  provided  on  a  straight-line  basis,  primarily  over  its  average  remaining  useful  life.  FPL  includes  in depreciation expense a provision for electric generation plant dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, accretion related to asset retirement obligations  (see  Decommissioning  of  Nuclear  Plants,  Dismantlement  of  Plants  and  Other  Accrued  Asset  Removal  Costs  below)  and  storm recovery amortization. For substantially all of FPL's property, depreciation studies are performed periodically and filed with the FPSC which result in updated depreciation rates. As part of the 2021 rate agreement, the FPSC approved new unified depreciation rates which became effective January 1, 2022. These new rates are expected to decrease depreciation expense. Reserve amortization is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets at December 31, 2021 and noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020 on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. The FPL segment used available reserve amortization to offset all of the storm restoration costs that were expensed during 2019 through 2021. See Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below. FPL files a twelve-month forecast with the FPSC each year which contains a regulatory ROE intended to be earned based on the best information FPL has at that time assuming normal weather. This forecast establishes a targeted regulatory ROE. In order to earn the targeted regulatory  ROE in each reporting period subject to the conditions of the effective rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&amp;M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items is adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization or its reversal to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. See Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 above.\n\nNEER's electric plant in service and other property less salvage value, if any, are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. NEER reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. NEER's oil and gas production assets are accounted  for  under  the  successful  efforts  method.  Depletion  expenses  for  the  acquisition  of  reserve  rights  and  development  costs  are recognized using the unit of production method.\n\nNuclear Fuel - FPL and NEER have several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel. See Note 15 - Contracts. FPL's and NEER's nuclear fuel costs are charged to fuel expense on a unit of production method.\n\nConstruction Activity - Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is a noncash item which represents the allowed cost of capital, including an ROE, used to finance construction projects. FPL records the portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds as a reduction of interest expense and the remainder as other income. FPSC rules limit the recording of AFUDC to projects that have an estimated cost in excess of 0.5% prior to 2021 and 0.4% beginning in 2021 of a utility's plant in service balance and require more than one year to complete. FPSC rules allow construction projects below the applicable threshold as a component of rate base.\n\nFPL's  construction  work  in  progress  includes  construction  materials,  progress  payments  on  major  equipment  contracts,  engineering  costs, AFUDC and other costs directly associated with the construction of various projects. Upon completion of the projects, these costs are transferred to electric utility plant in service and other property. Capitalized costs associated with construction activities are charged to O&amp;M expenses when recoverability is no longer probable.\n\nNEER capitalizes project development costs once it is probable that such costs will be realized through the ultimate construction of the related asset or sale of development rights. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NEER's capitalized development costs totaled approximately $831 million and $571 million, respectively, which are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. These costs include land rights and other third-party costs directly associated with the development of a new project. Upon commencement of construction, these costs either are transferred to construction work in progress or remain in other assets, depending upon the nature of the cost. Capitalized development costs are charged to O&amp;M expenses when it is probable that these costs will not be realized.\n\nNEER's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, third-party engineering costs,  capitalized  interest  and  other  costs  directly  associated  with  the  construction  and  development  of  various  projects.  Interest  expense allocated from NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH) to NEER is based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership  interests  sold  by  NextEra  Energy  Resources'  subsidiaries.  Upon  commencement  of  project  operation,  costs  associated  with construction work in progress are transferred to electric plant in service and other property. In 2019, NEER determined it was no longer moving forward with the construction of a 220 MW wind facility due to unresolved permitting issues. NEE recorded charges of approximately $72 million ($54 million after tax), which are included in taxes other than income taxes and other - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to the write-off of capitalized construction costs.",

          "chunk_text": "\nIntangible liabilities of $91 million recorded under acquisition accounting for transportation contracts at Southern Company Gas were fully amortized at December 31, 2019.\n\n## Acquisition Accounting\n\nAt the time of an acquisition, management will assess whether acquired assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, operating results from the date of acquisition are included in the acquiring entity's financial statements. The purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired.\n\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and management may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.\n\nHistorically, contingent consideration primarily relates to fixed amounts due to the seller once an acquired construction project is placed in service. For contingent consideration with variable payments, management fair values the arrangement with any changes recorded in the statements of income. See Note 13 for additional fair value information.\n\n## Development Costs\n\nFor Southern Power, development costs are capitalized once a project is probable of completion, primarily based on a review of its economics and operational feasibility, as well as the status of power off-take agreements and regulatory approvals, if applicable. Southern Power's capitalized development costs are included in CWIP on the balance sheets. All of Southern Power's development costs incurred prior to the determination that a project is probable of completion are expensed as incurred and included in other operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income. If it is determined that a project is no longer probable of completion, any of Southern Power's capitalized development costs are expensed and included in other operations and maintenance expense in the statements of income.\n\n## Long-Term Service Agreements\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance support for certain of their generating facilities. The LTSAs cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment,",

      "answer": "Duke Energy's $487 million goodwill allocation to gas infrastructure (via its stake in NextEra's NEER segment) sits within a business unit that operates under significant regulatory oversight, including FERC, NERC, EPA, and state-level regulators like the PUCT. NEER's gas infrastructure assets must comply with environmental laws, market rules, and reliability standards, which directly affect how this goodwill is managed and protected. The regulatory environment\u2014including potential changes in carbon emission rules and environmental compliance costs\u2014introduces operational and financial risk that could impact the long-term valuation and impairment risk of this $487 million asset.",

      "question": "How do Southern Company Gas' active gas pipeline investments, including its 50% stake in the Dalton Pipeline, compare with Duke Energy's $7 million impairment charges on natural gas pipeline investments in terms of strategic exposure to midstream infrastructure risk?",

In contrast, Duke Energy recorded $7 million in impairment charges related to natural gas pipeline investments, signaling potential challenges or devaluation in its midstream assets. This contrast suggests differing risk exposures: Southern Company Gas continues to leverage pipeline investments for supply assurance, while Duke Energy has already recognized financial impacts from asset devaluation in the same sector.",

          "chunk_text": "A majority of Southern Power's partnerships in renewable facilities allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at differing percentages, with Southern Power being the controlling member and thus consolidating the assets and operations of the partnerships. At December 31, 2021, Southern Power had eight tax equity partnership arrangements where the tax equity investors receive substantially all of the tax benefits from the facilities, including ITCs and PTCs. In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in non-tax equity partnerships with its ownership interests primarily ranging from 51% to 66%.\n\nSee PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional detail regarding Southern Power's partnership arrangements and Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.\n\nSouthern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected inservice value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2021 was 95% through 2026 and 92% through 2031, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 13 years. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 47% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 42% were with BBB+ to BBB- or equivalent rated counterparties, and 8% were with unrated entities that either have ratemaking authority or have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.\n\nSouthern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an \"all other\" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including storage operations and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' other businesses also included wholesale gas services. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' recent dispositions, including the sale of Sequent.\n\nGas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains 76,289 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Gas distribution operations serves approximately 4.3 million customers across four states.\n\nGas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to",

      "question": "How does Southern Company's stake in Gulf Power position it relative to NEE's recent operating cost increases tied to new investments and weather-related expenses?",
      "answer": "Southern Company holds a stake in Gulf Power, which is a segment within its broader energy portfolio and is reflected in its consolidated filings. Gulf Power's operating expenses - net were $1,216 million in 2019, as reported in NEE's consolidated financial statements. NEE, on the other hand, experienced a $309 million increase in operating expenses - net for 2021, driven by higher depreciation from new investments, increased fuel costs, and $73 million in additional O&M expenses linked to bad debt from the February 2021 weather event. This context suggests that Southern Company\u2019s exposure through Gulf Power may be subject to similar cost pressures, though Gulf Power\u2019s 2019 figures indicate a lower baseline for comparison, raising questions about how Southern Company's structure and diversification might mitigate or amplify such risks relative to NEE\u2019s standalone position.",

Results from projects and pipelines are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation or ownership. Project results, including repowered  wind  projects,  are  included  in  existing  generation  and  storage  assets  and  pipeline  results  are  included  in  gas  infrastructure  beginning  with  the  thirteenth  month  of operation or ownership.\n\n(b)    Excludes allocation of interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses.\n\n(c)    See Overview - Adjusted Earnings for additional information.\n\n## New Investments\n\nIn 2021, results from new investments increased primarily due to higher earnings, including the net effect of deferred income taxes and other benefits associated with PTCs and ITCs, related to the addition of wind and solar generating projects and battery storage during or after 2020.\n\nThe discussion below describes changes in certain line items set forth in NEE's consolidated statements of income as they relate to NEER.\n\n## Operating Revenues\n\nOperating revenues for 2021 decreased $1,993 million primarily due to:\n\n- the impact of non-qualifying commodity hedges due primarily to changes in energy prices (approximately $2,510 million of losses during 2021 compared to $244 million of losses for 2020), and\n- lower revenues from existing generation and storage assets of $331 million primarily due to the impacts of severe prolonged winter weather in  Texas  in  February  2021  (February  2021  weather  event),  the  absence  of  revenues  of  certain  wind  and  solar  facilities  sold  to  NEP  in October 2021 and lower nuclear revenues, due primarily to the closure of Duane Arnold in August 2020,\n\npartly offset by,\n\n- revenues from new investments of $263 million,\n- net increases in revenues of $247 million from the customer supply, proprietary power and gas trading, and gas infrastructure businesses, and\n- higher revenues of $56 million from NEET primarily related to the acquisition of GridLiance in 2021.\n\n## Operating Expenses -net\n\nOperating expenses - net for 2021 increased $309 million primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense of $116 million primarily related to new  investments,  higher  fuel  costs  of  $98  million  and  an  increase  of  $73  million  in  O&amp;M  expenses  primarily  related  to  bad  debt  expense associated with the February 2021 weather event (see Note 1 - Credit Losses).\n\n## Gains on Disposal of Businesses/Assets -net\n\nIn 2021, gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net primarily relate to sales of ownership interests in wind and solar projects to NEP and a third party;  in  2020,  the  amount  was  primarily  related  to  the  sale  of  the  Spain  projects  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020.

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) has significant hedge maturities in June 2028 ($645 million notional at 4.75% pay rate) and June 2034 ($537 million notional at 5.31% pay rate), which could expose the company to interest rate risk if refinancing at higher rates upon maturity. Georgia Power, as a Southern Company segment, faces potential maximum annual NEIL policy assessments of $89 million related to nuclear insurance liabilities, which could impact cash flow predictability. Both factors represent long-term financial obligations that could constrain debt management flexibility \u2013 DUK through potential refinancing costs and Georgia Power through retrospective insurance assessments \u2013 though DUK's exposure is more directly tied to interest rate volatility while Georgia Power's relates to operational risk funding requirements.",

      "answer": "Georgia Power has an $8.6 billion CWIP balance for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are under construction and carry significant uncertainties around cost recovery due to regulatory, legal, and construction risks. This contrasts with Florida Power & Light\u2019s nuclear involvement, which is limited to joint ownership in already-operational plants like Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 and 2. As a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Florida Power & Light benefits from a more diversified and mature asset base with less exposure to new construction risk. Georgia Power, under Southern Company, is shouldering a larger portion of new nuclear build risk, which reflects a more aggressive capital investment strategy compared to Florida Power & Light\u2019s more stable, existing-asset-focused approach.",

      "answer": "NextEra Energy's decision to leave the Southern Company power pool could significantly affect Gulf Power's capital expenditures strategy. Historically, Gulf Power spent $729M in 2019, $1,012M in 2020, and $782M in 2021 on capital expenditures, indicating a dynamic investment approach. As a former subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Gulf Power operated under the Integrated Interconnection Service Agreement (IIC) with a defined transition period following its sale in January 2019. The departure of NextEra Energy from the power pool may disrupt Gulf Power's access to coordinated economic dispatch and shared energy resources, which were key benefits under the IIC.

Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. In February 2021, Southern Company joined a filing at the FERC proposing a Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) that included many of the other electric service providers in the Southeast. In October 2021, the proposal became effective by operation of law following a tie vote by the FERC, subject to certain rehearing requests. A petition for appeal has been filed regarding the FERC's orders. SEEM is an extension of the existing bilateral market where participants will use an automated, intra-hour energy exchange to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. SEEM is expected to begin service in mid-2022. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\nThe utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the Southern Company power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions with third parties. In connection with the sale of former subsidiary Gulf Power in January 2019, an appendix was added to the IIC setting forth terms and conditions governing Gulf Power's continued participation in the IIC for a defined transition period.

In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See \"Regulation - Nuclear Regulation\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Southern Power\n\nSouthern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs, including contracts for differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fixed price for electricity sold to the grid, primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the traditional electric operating companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - OVERVIEW - \"Business Activities\" in Item 7 herein.\n\nSouthern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue natural gas and renewable generation facilities, either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2021, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with various partners, totaled 12,446 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,066 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries).
