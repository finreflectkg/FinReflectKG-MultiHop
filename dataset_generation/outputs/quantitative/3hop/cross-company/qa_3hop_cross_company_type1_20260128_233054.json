      "question": "How does Microsoft's $12,478 million debt maturing in 2028 compare to Goldman Sachs' unsecured long-term borrowings due in the same year, and what might this indicate about their respective liquidity strategies for that period?",
      "answer": "Microsoft has $12,478 million in fixed-rate debt maturing in 2028, while Goldman Sachs has $224 million in unsecured long-term borrowings due in the same year. This significant difference suggests that Microsoft has a much larger obligation coming due in 2028 compared to Goldman Sachs, potentially requiring more proactive liquidity planning or refinancing activity by Microsoft in the years leading up to 2028.",

        "Hop 1: MS \u2192 2028: Microsoft discloses $12,478 million in fixed-rate debt maturing in 2028, indicating a significant obligation in that year.",

      "answer": "MetLife quantifies that a 100 basis point increase in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets reduces its net periodic pension cost by $105 million. This reflects a direct sensitivity of pension expense to investment return assumptions. Similarly, Mastercard discloses that its net periodic pension cost includes the expected return on plan assets as a key component, which is recognized in other income (expense), net. However, unlike MetLife's illustrative sensitivity analysis, Mastercard does not provide a specific dollar impact of a change in expected returns, indicating a difference in disclosure granularity between the two companies regarding pension cost drivers.",

These  costs  include  interest  cost,  expected  return  on  plan  assets, amortization  of  prior  service  costs  or  credits  and  gains  or  losses  previously  recognized  as  a  component  of  accumulated  other comprehensive  income  (loss).  The  service  cost  component  is  recognized  in  general  and  administrative  expenses  on  the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nDefined contribution plans - The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are recorded as employees render service to the Company. The charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nAdvertising and marketing - Expenses incurred to promote Mastercard's brand, products and services are recognized in advertising and marketing on the consolidated statement of operations. The timing of recognition is dependent on the type of advertising or marketing expense.\n\nForeign currency remeasurement and translation -  Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  are  remeasured  to  functional  currencies  using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are remeasured at the weighted-average exchange rate for the period. Resulting exchange gains and losses related to remeasurement are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nWhere  a  non-U.S.  currency  is  the  functional  currency,  translation  from  that  functional  currency  to  U.S.  dollars  is  performed  for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using  a  weighted-average  exchange  rate  for  the  period.  Resulting  translation  adjustments  are  reported  as  a  component  of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nTreasury stock - The Company records the repurchase of shares of its common stock at cost on the trade date of the transaction. These shares are considered treasury stock, which is a reduction to stockholders' equity. Treasury stock is included in authorized and issued shares but excluded from outstanding shares.\n\nShare-based payments -  The Company measures share-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and uses the straight-line method of attribution, net of estimated forfeitures, for expensing awards over the requisite employee service period. The Company estimates the fair value of its non-qualified stock option awards ('Options') using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units ('RSUs') is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the Company's stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents. The Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used to determine  the  grant  date  fair  value  of  performance  stock  units  ('PSUs')  granted.  All  share-based  compensation  expenses  are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nRedeemable  non-controlling  interests -  The  Company's  business  combinations  may  include  provisions  allowing  non-controlling equity owners the ability to require the Company to purchase additional interests in the subsidiary at their discretion. The interests are initially recorded at fair value and in subsequent reporting periods are accreted or adjusted to the estimated redemption value. The adjustments to the redemption value are recorded to retained earnings or additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.  The  redeemable  non-controlling  interests  are  considered  temporary  and  reported  outside  of  permanent  equity  on  the consolidated balance sheet at the greater of the carrying amount adjusted for the non-controlling interest's share of net income (loss) or its redemption value.\n\nEarnings per share -  The  Company calculates basic earnings per share ('EPS') by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock units using the treasury stock method. The Company may be required to calculate EPS using the two-class method as a result of its redeemable non-controlling interests. If redemption value exceeds the fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests, the excess would be a reduction to net income for the EPS calculation.",

      "question": "How did the decline in COF's average deposits compare to BAC's GWIM segment's deposit decrease, and what impact did this have on their respective net interest income?",
      "answer": "COF's average deposits decreased by $4.6 billion (11%) in 2023, while BAC's GWIM segment experienced a $53.0 billion drop in average deposits. COF reported net interest income of $2,518 million, reflecting the impact of lower deposit balances, while BAC's GWIM saw a $319 million decrease in net interest income, primarily driven by the decline in average deposit balances and a shift toward higher-yielding deposit products.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 Average Deposits: COF's average deposits declined by $4.6 billion (from $42,018 million to $37,411 million) in 2023, which directly affected its net interest income.",
        "Hop 2: Average Deposits \u2192 GWIM: BAC's GWIM segment reported a much larger $53.0 billion decrease in average deposits, driven by clients shifting funds to higher-yielding investment alternatives.",
        "Hop 3: GWIM \u2190 BAC: The drop in deposits for GWIM led to a $319 million decrease in net interest income, highlighting the financial impact of deposit outflows on the segment's performance."

      "answer": "JPMorgan's Climate Risk Management function develops stress testing mechanisms to assess potential climate-related financial impacts, which are designed to align with the firm\u2019s broader risk governance and Board-level oversight. These mechanisms help measure how climate risks could affect the firm\u2019s financial health under various scenarios. In contrast, Schwab has established formal risk metrics and reporting systems that directly measure the impact of strategy execution against predefined risk appetite statements, which are approved by the Board Risk Committee. While JPMorgan focuses on scenario-based climate stress testing, Schwab emphasizes structured risk metrics across key categories like operational, compliance, and financial risks, all tied to defined tolerance levels and Board-approved policies. Both firms integrate risk oversight into strategic decision-making, but JPMorgan\u2019s approach is scenario-driven and forward-looking, whereas Schwab\u2019s is metrics-driven and policy-aligned.",

The risk governance structure includes the Board of Directors, designated committees of the Board, and management risk committees.\n\nCSC's Board of Directors sets the tone and culture of effective risk management. The Board has a Risk Committee that assists the Board in setting the type and level of risks that the Company is willing to take and supports the independence and stature of independent risk management. The Board Risk Committee also assists the Board in overseeing and holding senior management accountable for implementing the Board's approved risk appetite, maintaining the Company's risk management and control processes, and managing the Company's activities in a safe and sound manner, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Board Risk Committee also approves risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics, key risk policies, and reviews information relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management, legal, and internal audit.\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the integrity of the Company's financial statements and financial reporting processes, the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors and performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditors, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, processes to assess and manage risk exposures, and other matters as directed by the Board. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board in oversight of compensation of the Company's directors, executive officers, and other senior officers. The Board Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight responsibilities regarding Board composition, performance, and developing corporate governance principles, policies, and procedures.\n\nSenior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for risk identification and assessment, risk response, risk measurement and monitoring, and risk reporting and escalation. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each client enterprise and support function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors. The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the G lobal Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the G lobal Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees. Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the G lobal Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:\n\n- Operational Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Information Security and Cybersecurity, Technology, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data Integrity, and Model Governance;\n- Compliance Risk Committee - provides oversight of compliance risk management (inclusive of compliance programs for Schwab's regulated entities, AntiMoney Laundering/Sanctions, Conduct, Fiduciary, Conflicts of Interest, and Privacy), policies, and risk tolerance levels providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure and employee conduct, including subcommittees covering Fiduciary and Conflicts of Interest Risk;\n- Financial Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of and approves credit, market, liquidity, and capital risk policies, limits, and ex posures and includes the Liquidity and Capital Subcommittee; and\n- New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of, and approves new products, including the policy, program, and process designed to oversee new products and services risks prior to and post launch.\n\nSenior management created the Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee to provide oversight of incentive compensation risks and achieve sound incentive compensation risk management practices; it reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.",

For COF, the same +100 basis points shock results in a 3.0% decrease in economic value of equity as of December 31, 2024.

          "chunk_text": "\n(a) Negative values represent a reduction in net interest income.\n\nWe use economic value of equity to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on the net present value of our assets and liabilities under a variety of interest rate scenarios. Economic value of equity is calculated based on our existing assets, liabilities and derivatives, and does not incorporate projected changes in our balance sheet. Key assumptions used in this calculation include the term structure of interest rates, as well as deposit repricing and liquidation profiles used to inform duration and cash flow schedules. The economic value of equity is calculated under multiple interest rate scenarios, including baseline and immediate upward and immediate downward interest rate shocks, to assess its sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Our current sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases in a declining interest rate scenario and increases in an increasing interest rate scenario. The level of this sensitivity is managed within board-approved policy limits.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.\n\nThese foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2024, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $43 billion were outstanding.\n\nWith respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of December 31, 2024. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2024. With respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the nex t twelve months, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net of hedges, would be approximately $136 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nThe actual impact of interest rate and foreign ex change rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan's credit card segment had a total contractual amount of $915,658 million in 2023, significantly higher than Capital One\u2019s consolidated benefit for credit losses of $1,944 million in 2021. While JPMorgan's exposure reflects a large outstanding balance, Capital One's benefit for credit losses indicates a net positive impact on earnings due to reversals or reductions in expected credit losses. This suggests that despite both firms having significant credit card portfolios, Capital One experienced a more favorable credit environment or reserve adjustments in 2021 compared to JPMorgan\u2019s static exposure in 2023.",

Meanwhile, Schwab's Advisor Services segment saw a 32% increase in total net revenues in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results and growth in interest-earning assets.

        "Hop 3: Advisor Services \u2190 SCHW: Schwab specifically attributes the 32% growth in Advisor Services net revenues to the full-year consolidation of TD Ameritrade and higher interest-earning assets, despite lower average yields."

Both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results in 2021. In addition, net interest revenue increased for Advisor Services due to growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances. The increase in trading revenue for Investor Services was supported by heightened client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020, following the October 6, 2020 TD Ameritrade acquisition.\n\nInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services' growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets.\n\n## Segment Expenses Excluding Interest\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50% and 35%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of TD Ameritrade's results of operations. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, higher bonus accrual, as well as annual merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter (see Item 8 - Note 15).\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services' expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment's client base and greater client base growth from TDA.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSchwab's business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.\n\nOur risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.",

      "question": "How does Capital One's reliance on service charges within its Consumer Banking business compare to Bank of America's performance in deposit-related fees, given the differing structures of their consumer revenue streams?",
      "answer": "Capital One's Consumer Banking business reports that service charges and other customer-related fees are a primary source of revenue, contributing significantly to its $1.5 billion net income in 2024. These service charges are primarily from consumer deposit accounts, including fees for account maintenance and ATM usage. In contrast, Bank of America reported $2,445 million in deposit-related fees for its Consumer Banking segment in 2024, which is a key component of its broader service charge revenue totaling $6,055 million across the corporation. This indicates that while both institutions rely on service charges, Capital One emphasizes them as a core revenue driver alongside net interest income, whereas Bank of America integrates them within a more diversified noninterest income portfolio that includes larger contributions from card income and asset management fees.",

Interchange fees are primarily from our Credit Card business and are recognized upon settlement with the interchange networks, net of rewards earned by customers. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Consumer Banking business are primarily related to fees earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services such as automated teller machine ('ATM') usage. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Commercial Banking business are mostly related to fees earned on treasury management and capital markets services. Other contract revenue in our Credit Card business consists primarily of revenue from our partnership arrangements. Other contract revenue in our Consumer Banking business consists primarily of revenue earned from services provided to auto industry participants. Revenue from contracts with customers is included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe following table presents revenue from contracts with customers and a reconciliation to non-interest income by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Table 18.2: Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Reconciliation to Segment Results\n\n",

In contrast, Schwab's total average daily deposits, which include money market and other savings deposits, declined from $233,091 million in 2023 to $200,074 million in 2024, with the interest rate dropping from 0.59% to 0.56%.

AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n- Market making consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from client execution activities related to making markets in interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies, commodities and equity products. These activities are included in Global Banking &amp; Markets.\n- Other principal transactions consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from  our  equity  investing  activities,  including  revenues  related  to  our consolidated  investments  (included  in  Asset  &amp;  Wealth  Management), and  debt  investing  and  lending  activities  (included  across  our  three segments).\n\nOperating  Environment. During  2024,  the  operating  environment  was generally  characterized  by  continued  broad  macroeconomic  concerns, including  concerns  and  uncertainty  about  inflation,  ongoing  geopolitical tensions, central bank  policy and the potential outcome  of  national elections.  In  investment  banking,  industry-wide  underwriting  volumes increased compared with 2023, driven by strong levels of debt offerings and  improved  levels  of  equity  offerings,  while  industry-wide  completed mergers and acquisitions volumes remained below historical averages.  In market  making,  activity  levels  were  mixed,  as  activity  levels  in  fixed income-related  products  decreased  compared  with  the  prior  year,  while activity  levels  in  equity-related  products  increased.  Global  equity  prices were generally higher compared with the end of 2023, and concerns about the  commercial  real  estate  market  persisted.  In  the  U.S.,  the  rate  of unemployment  remained  low  and  the  pace  of  growth  in  consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2023.\n\nIf  uncertainty and concerns about geopolitical tensions and the economic outlook  remain  elevated  or  grow,  including  those  about  central  bank policy,  inflation  and  the  commercial  real  estate  sector,  it  may  lead  to  a decline in asset prices, a decline in market-making activity levels, a decline in  industry-wide  investment  banking  volumes,  and  net  revenues  and provision  for  credit  losses  would  likely  be  negatively  impacted.  See 'Segment Assets  and  Operating  Results  -  Segment  Operating  Results' for  information  about  the  operating  environment  and  material  trends  and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.\n\n## 2024 versus 2023\n\nNet  revenues  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  were  $53.51 billion  for  2024,  16%  higher  than  2023,  primarily  reflecting  significantly higher  other  principal  transactions  revenues,  net  interest  income  and investment banking revenues and higher investment management revenues.\n\nNon-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated  statements  of  earnings  were  $7.74  billion  for  2024,  24% higher than 2023, primarily reflecting significantly higher revenues in debt underwriting, primarily driven by leveraged finance activity, and in equity underwriting, primarily driven by secondary and initial public offerings. In addition,  revenues  in  advisory  were  higher,  reflecting  an  increase  in completed mergers and acquisitions transactions.\n\nInvestment management  revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings  were  $10.60  billion  for  2024,  11%  higher  than  2023,  primarily due to higher management and other fees, primarily reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision (AUS).\n\nCommissions  and  fees  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  were $4.09 billion  for  2024,  8%  higher  than  2023,  due  to  higher  commissions and  fees  in  Equities,  reflecting  generally  higher  market  volumes  and increased transaction fees, partially offset by a loss related to the planned transition of the GM credit card program to another issuer.\n\nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $18.39  billion  for  2024,  essentially  unchanged  compared  with  2023. Market  making  revenues  from  intermediation activities were  slightly higher,  primarily  reflecting  significantly  higher  revenues  in  equity  cash products, currencies and mortgages, offset by significantly lower revenues in commodities and equity derivatives. Market making revenues from financing activities were essentially unchanged, reflecting significantly  lower  revenues  in  FICC  financing,  offset  by  significantly higher revenues from Equities financing.\n\nOther  principal  transactions  revenues  in  the  consolidated  statements  of earnings  were  $4.65  billion  for  2024,  119%  higher  than  2023,  primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from  investments in private equities,  significantly  higher  net  gains  from  derivatives  related  to  our funding  activities,  the  impact  of  the  sale  of  the  Marcus  loan  portfolio  in 2023 (including net revenues of approximately $(370) million related to the sale of substantially all of the portfolio) and significantly lower net losses on hedges related to our relationship lending portfolio.",

      "answer": "Bank of America's total noninterest expense increased from $13,206 million in 2023 to $13,926 million in 2024, a rise of $720 million. This increase would reduce its pre-provision profit for 2024 compared to 2023. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase's pre-provision profit improved from $70,932 million in 2023 to $85,759 million in 2024, an increase of $14,827 million. Therefore, while BAC experienced rising expenses that pressured profitability before credit provisions, JPM saw a significant strengthening in its pre-provision profit year-over-year.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 Total Noninterest Expense: BAC's total noninterest expense rose from $13,206 million in 2023 to $13,926 million in 2024, indicating higher operating costs.",
        "Hop 2: Total Noninterest Expense \u2192 Pre-Provision Profit: Pre-provision profit is calculated as total net revenue minus total noninterest expense; thus, an increase in expense reduces pre-provision profit.",

      "question": "How does the level of nonperforming commercial real estate loans at Capital One (COF) compare to the total commercial and residential real estate loan exposure reported by Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities segment, and what might this indicate about their respective risk profiles in the commercial real estate market?",
      "answer": "Capital One reported $509 million in nonperforming commercial and multifamily real estate loans as of December 31, 2024, representing a significant risk in their commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio. Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities segment, on the other hand, disclosed $8,678 million in held-for-investment (HFI) commercial and residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2023. Given that Capital One's nonperforming CRE loans make up a notable portion of their total CRE loan book, and Morgan Stanley maintains a much larger overall real estate exposure, the two firms demonstrate differing risk profiles: Capital One shows signs of asset quality stress in CRE, while Morgan Stanley's larger loan book suggests broader market exposure but does not indicate current performance issues.",

Wealth Management covers: financial advisor-led brokerage, custody, administrative and investment advisory services; selfdirected brokerage services; financial and wealth planning services; workplace  services,  including  stock  plan  administration;  securities-based lending,  residential  and  commercial  real  estate  loans  and  other  lending products; banking; and retirement plan services.\n\nInvestment Management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. Strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fix ed income, alternatives and solutions,  and  liquidity  and  overlay  services.  Institutional  clients  include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations,  endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. Individual  clients  are  generally  served  through  intermediaries,  including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.\n\n## Basis of Financial Information\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of  certain  financial  instruments,  the  valuations  of  goodwill  and  intangible assets,  the  outcome  of  legal  and  tax   matters,  deferred  tax   assets, ACL,  and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm  believes  that  the  estimates  utilized  in  the  preparation  of  its  financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\n\nThe Notes are an integral part of the Firm's financial statements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements  through  the  date  of  this  report  and  has  not  identified  any recordable  or  disclosable  events  not  otherwise  reported  in  these  financial statements or the notes thereto.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries  and  other  entities  in  which  the  Firm  has  a  controlling  financial interest,  including  certain  V IEs  (see  Note  15).  Intercompany  balances  and transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as Noncontrolling  interests.  The  net  income  attributable  to  Noncontrolling interests  for  such  subsidiaries  is  presented  as  Net  income  applicable  to noncontrolling interests in the income statement. The portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented  as  Noncontrolling  interests,  a  component  of  Total  equity,  in  the balance sheet.\n\nFor entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity  to  finance  its  activities  without  additional  subordinated  financial support and the equity holders bear the residual economic risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly  affect  its  economic  performance,  the  Firm  consolidates  those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. For VIEs  (i.e.,  entities  that  do  not  meet  the  aforementioned  criteria),  the  Firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most  significantly  affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  V IE  and  has  the obligation  to  absorb  losses  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  that  could potentially be significant to the V IE.\n\nFor  investments  in  entities  in  which  the  Firm  does  not  have  a  controlling financial  interest  but  has  significant  influence  over  operating  and  financial decisions, it applies the equity method",

      "answer": "MetLife Holdings saw a decrease in Policyholder Account Balances from $25,688 million in 2022 to $23,178 million in 2023, a decline of $2,510 million. This reflects a reduction in account balances for this segment over the two-year period. In contrast, AIG recognizes additional liabilities beyond Policyholder Account Balances for universal life policies with secondary guarantees, based on the present value of expected payments over the life of the contract. These additional liabilities are reported within the liability for future policy benefits, separate from Policyholder Account Balances, and are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity securities available for sale.",

      "answer": "MetLife's RIS segment liabilities related to Market Risk Benefits decreased from $8 million in 2022 to $(13) million in 2023, indicating a shift in fair value measurement. AIG, upon adopting the new accounting standard for Market Risk Benefits in 2023, reported a reclassification of non-performance risk adjustments from Retained Earnings to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), significantly impacting its Individual and Group Retirement segments. This reflects a broader impact of fair value changes and non-performance risk adjustments on AIG's financial statements compared to MetLife's more modest liability change.",

      "answer": "Citi's 3Q24 forecast for the U.S. unemployment rate is exactly 4.4%, as noted in their quarterly average projections. In contrast, JPM's central case assumption at the end of 2023 for 4Q24 was 4.4%, but their forward-looking assumptions at the end of 2024 project a decline to 4.3% by 4Q25. This suggests that while both institutions aligned on the near-term outlook for late 2024, JPM anticipates a slightly faster improvement in labor market conditions in early 2025 compared to Citi's more stable view through 3Q25 at 4.4%.",

This was driven by increases in both non-interest revenues and interest income, despite rising interest expenses. In contrast, SCHW's Advisor Services segment net revenues increased by 32% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results and growth in interest-earning assets. However, by 2022, there was a $2 million reduction in liabilities related to severance and retention costs in the Advisor Services segment, indicating cost optimization efforts.

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Segment Net Revenues\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 68% and 32%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. Both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results in 2021. In addition, net interest revenue increased for Advisor Services due to growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances. The increase in trading revenue for Investor Services was supported by heightened client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020, following the October 6, 2020 TD Ameritrade acquisition.\n\nInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services' growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets.\n\n## Segment Expenses Excluding Interest\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50% and 35%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of TD Ameritrade's results of operations. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, higher bonus accrual, as well as annual merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter (see Item 8 - Note 15).\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services' expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment's client base and greater client base growth from TDA.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSchwab's business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.\n\nOur risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan estimates that a 2.1% average increase in the U.S. unemployment rate over eight quarters, peaking at 2.7% higher in Q4 2024, significantly elevates modeled credit losses. This macroeconomic variable is a key input in JPM's allowance for credit losses. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley holds $641 million in non-agency CMBS maturing after 5 through 10 years with a 3.7% average yield. Given the U.S. unemployment rate's forecasted range of 3% to 8% in Q4 2024, Morgan Stanley's CMBS portfolio could face increased credit risk, which may impact the valuation and yield of these securities, similar to how JPM adjusts its credit loss reserves under adverse unemployment scenarios.",

        "Hop 1: JPM \u2192 U.S. Unemployment Rate: JPM uses the U.S. unemployment rate as a key macroeconomic variable in its credit loss modeling, with a relative adverse scenario assuming an average 2.1% higher rate over eight quarters, peaking at 2.7% higher in Q4 2024.",
        "Hop 2: U.S. Unemployment Rate \u2192 3.7%: The U.S. unemployment rate is forecasted to range between 3% and 8% in Q4 2024, aligning with the 3.7% average yield on Morgan Stanley's non-agency CMBS maturing after 5 through 10 years.",
        "Hop 3: 3.7% \u2190 MS: Morgan Stanley reports a $641 million holding in non-agency CMBS maturing after 5 through 10 years with a 3.7% average yield, indicating sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment."

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation\n\n## The Firm\n\nMorgan Stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market  positions  in  each  of  its  business  segments-Institutional  Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms 'Morgan Stanley' or the 'Firm' mean Morgan  Stanley  (the  'Parent  Company')  together  with  its  consolidated subsidiaries.  See  the  'G lossary  of  Common  Terms  and Acronyms'  for  the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this Form 10-K.\n\nA description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the Firm's business segments is as follows:\n\nInstitutional  Securities  provides  a  variety  of  products  and  services  to corporations,  governments, financial  institutions  and  ultra-high  net  worth clients. Investment Banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including the underwriting of debt, equity securities and other products, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and project finance. Our Equity and Fixed Income businesses include  sales,  financing,  prime  brokerage,  market-making,  Asia  wealth management  services  and  certain  business-related  investments.  Lending activities  include  originating  corporate  loans  and  commercial  real  estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending securities-based and other financing to clients. Other activities include research.\n\nWealth Management provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to medium-sized businesses and institutions. Wealth Management covers: financial advisor-led brokerage, custody, administrative and investment advisory services; selfdirected brokerage services; financial and wealth planning services; workplace  services,  including  stock  plan  administration;  securities-based lending,  residential  and  commercial  real  estate  loans  and  other  lending products; banking; and retirement plan services.\n\nInvestment Management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. Strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fix ed income, alternatives and solutions,  and  liquidity  and  overlay  services.  Institutional  clients  include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations,  endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. Individual  clients  are  generally  served  through  intermediaries,  including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.\n\n## Basis of Financial Information\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of  certain  financial  instruments,  the  valuations  of  goodwill  and  intangible assets,  the  outcome  of  legal  and  tax   matters,  deferred  tax   assets, ACL,  and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm  believes  that  the  estimates  utilized  in  the  preparation  of  its  financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\n\nThe Notes are an integral part of the Firm's financial statements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements  through  the  date  of  this  report  and  has  not  identified  any recordable  or  disclosable  events  not  otherwise  reported  in  these  financial statements or the notes thereto.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries  and  other  entities  in  which  the  Firm  has  a  controlling  financial interest,  including  certain  V IEs  (see  Note  15).  Intercompany  balances  and transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as Noncontrolling  interests.  The  net  income  attributable  to  Noncontrolling interests  for  such  subsidiaries  is  presented  as  Net  income  applicable  to noncontrolling interests in the income statement. The portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented  as  Noncontrolling  interests,  a  component  of  Total  equity,  in  the balance sheet.\n\nFor entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity  to  finance  its  activities  without  additional  subordinated  financial support and the equity holders bear the residual economic risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly  affect  its  economic  performance,  the  Firm  consolidates  those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. For VIEs  (i.e.,  entities  that  do  not  meet  the  aforementioned  criteria),  the  Firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most  significantly  affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  V IE  and  has  the obligation  to  absorb  losses  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  that  could potentially be significant to the V IE.\n\nFor  investments  in  entities  in  which  the  Firm  does  not  have  a  controlling financial  interest  but  has  significant  influence  over  operating  and  financial decisions, it applies the equity method",

      "answer": "AXP reported a reserve release in the prior year for Card Member Receivables that was driven by lower delinquencies and a decrease in receivables outstanding. In contrast, MS disclosed a $65 million total provision release in their 2024 loan portfolio, with a $68 million release in SBL and Other loans partially offsetting a $3 million reduction in Residential Real Estate.

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation\n\n## The Firm\n\nMorgan Stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market  positions  in  each  of  its  business  segments-Institutional  Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms 'Morgan Stanley' or the 'Firm' mean Morgan  Stanley  (the  'Parent  Company')  together  with  its  consolidated subsidiaries.  See  the  'G lossary  of  Common  Terms  and Acronyms'  for  the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this Form 10-K.\n\nA description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the Firm's business segments is as follows:\n\nInstitutional  Securities  provides  a  variety  of  products  and  services  to corporations,  governments, financial  institutions  and  ultra-high  net  worth clients. Investment Banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including the underwriting of debt, equity securities and other products, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and project finance. Our Equity and Fixed Income businesses include  sales,  financing,  prime  brokerage,  market-making,  Asia  wealth management  services  and  certain  business-related  investments.  Lending activities  include  originating  corporate  loans  and  commercial  real  estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending securities-based and other financing to clients. Other activities include research.\n\nWealth Management provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to medium-sized businesses and institutions. Wealth Management covers: financial advisor-led brokerage, custody, administrative and investment advisory services; selfdirected brokerage services; financial and wealth planning services; workplace  services,  including  stock  plan  administration;  securities-based lending,  residential  and  commercial  real  estate  loans  and  other  lending products; banking; and retirement plan services.\n\nInvestment Management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. Strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fix ed income, alternatives and solutions,  and  liquidity  and  overlay  services.  Institutional  clients  include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations,  endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. Individual  clients  are  generally  served  through  intermediaries,  including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.\n\n## Basis of Financial Information\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of  certain  financial  instruments,  the  valuations  of  goodwill  and  intangible assets,  the  outcome  of  legal  and  tax   matters,  deferred  tax   assets, ACL,  and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm  believes  that  the  estimates  utilized  in  the  preparation  of  its  financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\n\nThe Notes are an integral part of the Firm's financial statements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements  through  the  date  of  this  report  and  has  not  identified  any recordable  or  disclosable  events  not  otherwise  reported  in  these  financial statements or the notes thereto.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries  and  other  entities  in  which  the  Firm  has  a  controlling  financial interest,  including  certain  V IEs  (see  Note  15).  Intercompany  balances  and transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as Noncontrolling  interests.  The  net  income  attributable  to  Noncontrolling interests  for  such  subsidiaries  is  presented  as  Net  income  applicable  to noncontrolling interests in the income statement. The portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented  as  Noncontrolling  interests,  a  component  of  Total  equity,  in  the balance sheet.\n\nFor entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity  to  finance  its  activities  without  additional  subordinated  financial support and the equity holders bear the residual economic risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly  affect  its  economic  performance,  the  Firm  consolidates  those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. For VIEs  (i.e.,  entities  that  do  not  meet  the  aforementioned  criteria),  the  Firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most  significantly  affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  V IE  and  has  the obligation  to  absorb  losses  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  that  could potentially be significant to the V IE.\n\nFor  investments  in  entities  in  which  the  Firm  does  not  have  a  controlling financial  interest  but  has  significant  influence  over  operating  and  financial decisions, it applies the equity method",

      "answer": "As of December 31, 2024, a +200 basis point interest rate shock decreased Charles Schwab\u2019s economic value of equity by 6.3%, while Capital One experienced a slightly larger decline of 8.4%. This indicates that Capital One had greater interest rate risk exposure relative to Schwab at year-end, suggesting Schwab\u2019s balance sheet was somewhat more resilient to rising rate environments based on this metric.",

        "Hop 1: SCHW \u2192 Economic Value of Equity: Schwab actively manages and models interest rate risk, including assessing the impact of rate changes on economic value of equity (EVE), as outlined in their 2024 10-K filing.",
        "Hop 2: Economic Value of Equity \u2192 +200 Basis Points: Both firms disclose the estimated impact of a +200 basis point shock on EVE, with Schwab at -6.3% and Capital One at -8.4% as of December 31, 2024.",
        "Hop 3: +200 Basis Points \u2190 COF: Capital One\u2019s 2024 10-K explicitly reports that a +200 basis point rate increase would reduce its EVE by 8.4%, showing higher sensitivity compared to Schwab."

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nIn addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as 'believe,' 'anticipate,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'will,' 'may,' 'estimate,' 'appear,' 'could,' 'would,' 'expand,' 'aim,' 'maintain,' 'continue,' 'seek,' and other similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to ex pectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements, which reflect management's beliefs, objectives, and expectations as of the date hereof, are estimates based on the best judgment of Schwab's senior management. These statements relate to, among other things:\n\n- Maximizing our market valuation and stockholder returns over time; our belief that developing trusted relationships will translate into more client assets which drives revenue and, along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management, generates earnings growth and builds stockholder value (see Business Strategy and Competitive Environment, and Products and Services in Part I - Item 1);\n- Capital expenditures and expense management (see Results of Operations in Overview and Results of Operations - Total Expenses Excluding Interest in Part II - Item 7);\n- Net interest revenue, the adjustment of rates paid on client-related liabilities, and client cash realignment activity (see Results of Operations - Net Interest Revenue in Part II - Item 7);\n- Utilization of bank supplemental funding and expectations for repayment of outstanding balances (see Results of Operations in Part II - Item 7, and Liquidity Risk in Part II - Item 7);\n- Management of interest rate risk; modeling and assumptions, the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest margin and revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, economic value of equity, and liability and asset duration (see Risk Management in Part II - Item 7);\n- Sources and uses of liquidity (see Liquidity Risk in Part II - Item 7);\n- Capital management; potential migration of IDA balances to our balance sheet; capital accretion; expectations about capital requirements, including AOCI; long-term operating objective; and uses of capital and return of excess capital to stockholders, including dividends and repurchases (see Capital Management - Regulatory Capital Requirements in Part II - Item 7; and Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15);\n- The expected impact of proposed and final rules (see Current Regulatory and Other Developments in Part II - Item 7);\n- The expected impact of new accounting standards not yet adopted (see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 2);\n- The likelihood of indemnification and guarantee payment obligations and clients failing to fulfill contractual obligations (see Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15, and Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk - Client Trade Settlement in Note 18); and\n- The outcome and impact of legal proceedings and regulatory matters (see Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15, and Legal Proceedings in Part I - Item 3).\n\nAchievement of the expressed beliefs, objectives and expectations described in these statements is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the ex pressed beliefs, objectives, and ex pectations. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference, as of the date of those documents.\n\nImportant factors that may cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to:\n\n- General market conditions, including the level of interest rates, equity market valuations and volatility;\n- Our ability to attract and retain clients, develop trusted relationships, and grow client assets;\n- Client use of our advisory and lending solutions and other products and services;\n- The level of client assets, including cash balances;\n- Client cash allocations and sensitivity to deposit rates;\n- The level and mix of client trading activity, including daily average trades, margin balances, and balance sheet cash;\n- Regulatory guidance and adverse impacts from new or changed legislation, rulemaking or regulatory expectations;\n- Capital and liquidity needs and management;",

      "answer": "MetLife's net periodic pension cost is significantly impacted by changes in the expected rate of return, with a 100 bps increase reducing costs by $105 million. This indicates that MetLife's pension asset performance directly influences its income statement. In contrast, Mastercard recognizes its net periodic pension cost (excluding service cost) in 'other income (expense), net'\u2014a line item that could be more volatile due to such pension-related adjustments.

          "chunk_text": "Pension and other postretirement plans - The Company recognizes the funded status of its single-employer defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans as assets or liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at December 31, the measurement date. Overfunded plans, if any, are aggregated and recorded in other assets, while underfunded plans are aggregated and recorded as accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nNet periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost/(income), excluding the service cost component, is recognized in other income (expense),  net  on  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  These  costs  include  interest  cost,  expected  return  on  plan  assets, amortization  of  prior  service  costs  or  credits  and  gains  or  losses  previously  recognized  as  a  component  of  accumulated  other comprehensive  income  (loss).  The  service  cost  component  is  recognized  in  general  and  administrative  expenses  on  the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nDefined contribution plans - The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are recorded as employees render service to the Company. The charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nAdvertising and marketing - Expenses incurred to promote Mastercard's brand, products and services are recognized in advertising and marketing on the consolidated statement of operations. The timing of recognition is dependent on the type of advertising or marketing expense.\n\nForeign currency remeasurement and translation -  Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  are  remeasured  to  functional  currencies  using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are remeasured at the weighted-average exchange rate for the period. Resulting exchange gains and losses related to remeasurement are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nWhere  a  non-U.S.  currency  is  the  functional  currency,  translation  from  that  functional  currency  to  U.S.  dollars  is  performed  for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using  a  weighted-average  exchange  rate  for  the  period.  Resulting  translation  adjustments  are  reported  as  a  component  of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nTreasury stock - The Company records the repurchase of shares of its common stock at cost on the trade date of the transaction. These shares are considered treasury stock, which is a reduction to stockholders' equity. Treasury stock is included in authorized and issued shares but excluded from outstanding shares.\n\nShare-based payments -  The Company measures share-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and uses the straight-line method of attribution, net of estimated forfeitures, for expensing awards over the requisite employee service period. The Company estimates the fair value of its non-qualified stock option awards ('Options') using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units ('RSUs') is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the Company's stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents. The Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used to determine  the  grant  date  fair  value  of  performance  stock  units  ('PSUs')  granted.  All  share-based  compensation  expenses  are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nRedeemable  non-controlling  interests -  The  Company's  business  combinations  may  include  provisions  allowing  non-controlling equity owners the ability to require the Company to purchase additional interests in the subsidiary at their discretion. The interests are initially recorded at fair value and in subsequent reporting periods are accreted or adjusted to the estimated redemption value. The adjustments to the redemption value are recorded to retained earnings or additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.  The  redeemable  non-controlling  interests  are  considered  temporary  and  reported  outside  of  permanent  equity  on  the consolidated balance sheet at the greater of the carrying amount adjusted for the non-controlling interest's share of net income (loss) or its redemption value.\n\nEarnings per share -  The  Company calculates basic earnings per share ('EPS') by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock units using the treasury stock method. The Company may be required to calculate EPS using the two-class method as a result of its redeemable non-controlling interests. If redemption value exceeds the fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests, the excess would be a reduction to net income for the EPS calculation.",

      "question": "How does the $11.0 billion liability for future policy benefits disclosed under AIG's Group Benefits segment compare to the market risk benefit remeasurement losses of $19,329 million reported by MetLife's Group Benefits segment in 2023, and what might this suggest about the sensitivity of their respective insurance liabilities to market risk?",
      "answer": "AIG disclosed a $11.0 billion liability for future policy benefits under its Group Benefits segment, reflecting long-term obligations tied to insurance contracts. Meanwhile, MetLife reported a $19,329 million market risk benefit (MRB) remeasurement loss for its Group Benefits segment in 2023, indicating the impact of market fluctuations on its liabilities. While AIG's disclosure highlights the scale of its policy-related obligations, MetLife's MRB loss reveals the volatility in its liabilities due to changing market conditions. This suggests that both companies face significant exposure through their Group Benefits offerings, but MetLife's financial performance in this segment is particularly sensitive to market risk, potentially requiring more dynamic risk management strategies.",

This indicates that JPMorgan's cost structure specifically in Asset & Wealth Management is notably higher than Bank of America\u2019s overall noninterest expense, suggesting a more resource-intensive approach to wealth management operations at JPMorgan.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase allocated $54.5 billion in equity to its Consumer & Community Banking segment as of January 1, 2024. This segment directly produces auto loans, among other consumer financial products. Capital One reported $2.252 billion in auto loans as part of its consumer banking portfolio as of December 31, 2023. Therefore, while JPMorgan has a broader and significantly larger equity commitment to consumer banking, Capital One's auto loan exposure is a more defined and smaller portion of its consumer banking operations.",

      "question": "How does JPM's revenue structure in Global Corporate Banking, as part of its broader Global Banking segment, compare with BAC's 2024 goodwill allocation to Global Banking, and what might this imply about their respective strategic investments in large corporate client services?",
      "answer": "JPM reports that its Global Corporate Banking segment provides banking products and services to large corporations, financial institutions, and merchants as part of the broader Global Banking client coverage view, which also includes Global Investment Banking and Commercial Banking. While exact revenue figures aren't provided, the structure indicates that Global Corporate Banking represents a distinct portion of JPM's focus on large corporate clients within its Banking & Payments business. Meanwhile, BAC allocated $24,026 million in goodwill specifically to its Global Banking segment as of December 31, 2024, reflecting a significant strategic investment in services for similar client groups. The combination of JPM's structural emphasis and BAC's substantial goodwill allocation suggests that both institutions prioritize large corporate banking, though through different financial and operational lenses\u2014JPM through diversified client coverage and BAC through capitalized goodwill investment.",

      "answer": "A sustained U.S. unemployment rate of 3.7% could moderately increase BAC's allowance for credit losses, as higher unemployment typically correlates with increased loan defaults. BAC's adverse macroeconomic scenario assumed a peak unemployment rate over two percentage points higher than baseline, which hypothetically increased the allowance by $3.8 billion. At 3.7%, which falls within the U.S. unemployment range for 2024\u20132025 projections (3%\u20138%), the impact would likely be less severe than the full $3.8 billion scenario. Meanwhile, MS's non-agency CMBS portfolio, which includes a segment maturing after 5 to 10 years yielding 3.7%, might indicate stable performance under such conditions, suggesting some resilience in fixed-income assets during mild unemployment increases. This combination implies a potentially offsetting dynamic: moderate credit loss pressure at BAC, but with some stability in broader fixed-income portfolios like those at MS.",

      "answer": "MET's Residential Portfolio Segment nonaccrual loan balances decreased from $534 million in 2020 to $442 million in 2021, a decline of $92 million. In contrast, SCHW's nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans dropped from 0.37% in 2020 to 0.10% in 2021, indicating a sharper proportional decline. This suggests that while both firms experienced reductions in nonaccrual loans, MET's change was absolute and significant in dollar terms, reflecting potentially different credit risk management strategies or portfolio compositions in residential lending.",

      "answer": "COF's domestic credit card portfolio saw a 1% decrease in customers with FICO scores above 660\u2014from 69% in 2022 to 68% in 2023\u2014indicating a slight deterioration in credit quality. Since AIG uses FICO scores as a primary credit quality indicator in its mortgage credit loss provisioning, this trend could signal higher consumer credit risk, potentially leading to an increase in AIG's allowance for credit losses. AIG's modeling methodology applies loss rates based on historical data and adjusts for current and forecasted conditions; thus, a broad-based decline in FICO scores across consumer portfolios like COF\u2019s could be interpreted as a negative signal for borrower performance, prompting AIG to raise its default probability assumptions in future forecasts.",

      "answer": "COF estimates that a +200 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a 3.4% increase in its projected baseline net interest income as of December 31, 2021. In contrast, AXP reports that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could reduce its annual net interest income by up to $206 million, given its $1.3 billion interest expense for 2021. This indicates that while COF benefits from rising rates, AXP faces significant downside risk to net interest income from the same rate movement, highlighting opposite sensitivities to interest rate changes between the two companies.",

If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease. As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on our annual net interest income of up to $206 million. A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change if benchmark interest rates change. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see 'Risk Management - Market Risk Management Process' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## The discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements.\n\nCertain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements will need to be amended or otherwise modified to replace references to the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) with an alternative reference rate, as the LIBOR tenors referenced are expected to be quoted only through June 2023. Alternative reference rates, such as the secured overnight financing rate, are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate differently than, and not be representative of, LIBOR. In order to compensate for these differences, certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment. However, there is no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR, either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements.\n\nUncertainty as to the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference rates and the discontinuance of LIBOR generally may negatively impact market liquidity, our access to funding and the trading market for our financial instruments. Furthermore, the timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could be subject to disputes, could cause the interest payable on our outstanding financial instruments and commercial agreements to be materially different than expected and may impact the value of such instruments and agreements.\n\n## Adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\n\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. Additional factors affecting the extent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## Any reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRatings of our long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, and the macroeconomic environment. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends, in part, on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts. If we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of our asset-backed securities, it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets.\n\n## Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital.\n\nDuring 2021, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them. Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign",

      "answer": "MET's 'Other Loans' portfolio grew from $2,526 million in 2020 to $4,223 million in 2021, representing a significant increase of $1,697 million. During the same period, AXP reported average payment term extensions for 'Other Loans' at 16 months in both 2020 and 2021, based on troubled debt restructurings. This suggests that while MET was expanding its exposure to this asset class, AXP was managing credit risk through consistent term extensions, potentially signaling differing credit risk mitigation approaches in response to similar loan performance challenges.",

      "answer": "Capital One has explicitly stated that its credit card portfolio performance correlates strongly with the U.S. unemployment rate, with delinquency trends being a key credit quality indicator. JPMorgan projects the unemployment rate will decline to 4.3% by 4Q25, suggesting improving labor market conditions. However, Citigroup's 4.4% forecast for Q3 2024 aligns with JPMorgan's earlier 4Q24 projection, indicating potential near-term stability at a higher unemployment level. If the unemployment rate remains at Citigroup's 4.4% forecast rather than declining as JPMorgan expects, Capital One could experience worse-than-anticipated delinquency trends in its credit card portfolio, particularly if this reflects a weakening labor market contrary to broader expectations.",

We discuss these risks and our credit quality indicator for each portfolio segment below.\n\n## Credit Card\n\nOur credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. Real G ross Domestic Product ('GDP') growth rate, as well as consumers' financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card loan portfolio is delinquency trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time.\n\nThe table below presents our credit card portfolio by delinquency status as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Table 4.3: Credit Card Delinquency Status\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Segment Net Revenues\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 68% and 32%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. Both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results in 2021. In addition, net interest revenue increased for Advisor Services due to growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances. The increase in trading revenue for Investor Services was supported by heightened client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020, following the October 6, 2020 TD Ameritrade acquisition.\n\nInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services' growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets.\n\n## Segment Expenses Excluding Interest\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50% and 35%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of TD Ameritrade's results of operations. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, higher bonus accrual, as well as annual merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter (see Item 8 - Note 15).\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services' expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment's client base and greater client base growth from TDA.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSchwab's business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.\n\nOur risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.",

      "answer": "JPM reports $170,163 million in total commercial real estate loans, with $57,125 million maturing between 1 and 5 years, $57,967 million between 5 and 15 years, and $42,597 million beyond 15 years. Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities segment reports $8,678 million in commercial and residential real estate loans under HFI and $209 million under HFS, with an additional $3,331 million at FVO. This indicates that JPM has a significantly larger exposure to long-dated commercial real estate loans compared to Morgan Stanley, which maintains a smaller, more diversified loan book within Institutional Securities that includes secured lending facilities and securities-based lending.",

Wealth Management covers: financial advisor-led brokerage, custody, administrative and investment advisory services; selfdirected brokerage services; financial and wealth planning services; workplace  services,  including  stock  plan  administration;  securities-based lending,  residential  and  commercial  real  estate  loans  and  other  lending products; banking; and retirement plan services.\n\nInvestment Management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. Strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fix ed income, alternatives and solutions,  and  liquidity  and  overlay  services.  Institutional  clients  include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations,  endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. Individual  clients  are  generally  served  through  intermediaries,  including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.\n\n## Basis of Financial Information\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of  certain  financial  instruments,  the  valuations  of  goodwill  and  intangible assets,  the  outcome  of  legal  and  tax   matters,  deferred  tax   assets, ACL,  and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm  believes  that  the  estimates  utilized  in  the  preparation  of  its  financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\n\nThe Notes are an integral part of the Firm's financial statements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements  through  the  date  of  this  report  and  has  not  identified  any recordable  or  disclosable  events  not  otherwise  reported  in  these  financial statements or the notes thereto.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries  and  other  entities  in  which  the  Firm  has  a  controlling  financial interest,  including  certain  V IEs  (see  Note  15).  Intercompany  balances  and transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as Noncontrolling  interests.  The  net  income  attributable  to  Noncontrolling interests  for  such  subsidiaries  is  presented  as  Net  income  applicable  to noncontrolling interests in the income statement. The portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented  as  Noncontrolling  interests,  a  component  of  Total  equity,  in  the balance sheet.\n\nFor entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity  to  finance  its  activities  without  additional  subordinated  financial support and the equity holders bear the residual economic risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly  affect  its  economic  performance,  the  Firm  consolidates  those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. For VIEs  (i.e.,  entities  that  do  not  meet  the  aforementioned  criteria),  the  Firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most  significantly  affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  V IE  and  has  the obligation  to  absorb  losses  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  that  could potentially be significant to the V IE.\n\nFor  investments  in  entities  in  which  the  Firm  does  not  have  a  controlling financial  interest  but  has  significant  influence  over  operating  and  financial decisions, it applies the equity method",

      "question": "Given that Schwab's Advisor Services segment experienced a 15% net revenue decline in 2023 primarily due to a drop in net interest revenue, how does this contrast with JPMorgan's net interest income performance in the same period, and what might this suggest about their respective exposure to interest rate dynamics?",
      "answer": "Schwab's Advisor Services segment reported a 15% decrease in net revenue in 2023, largely due to a decline in net interest revenue driven by higher-cost funding sources and lower average interest-earning asset balances. In contrast, JPMorgan reported a net interest income of $8,492 million in 2023, down from $11,900 million in 2022, indicating a year-over-year decline of $3,408 million or about 28.6%. This comparison suggests that both firms experienced pressure on net interest revenue in 2023, but JPMorgan's larger absolute decline may reflect a greater sensitivity to interest rate changes due to a different asset-liability structure or business model. Schwab's Advisor Services segment, with a smaller proportional drop and a more asset management-focused revenue base, may be less directly exposed to interest rate volatility compared to JPMorgan\u2019s broader lending and deposit activities.",

        "Hop 1: SCHW \u2192 Advisor Services: Schwab's Advisor Services segment had a total expense of $130 million in 2023, including $78 million in employee compensation and benefits, indicating a significant cost base tied to personnel and operations.",
        "Hop 2: Advisor Services \u2192 Net Interest Revenue: Advisor Services' net revenues decreased by 15% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a drop in net interest revenue caused by higher-cost funding sources and lower average interest-earning asset balances.",

      "answer": "Citi's USPB segment, which includes its Branded Cards and Retail Services, reported $171 billion in outstanding credit card balances at the end of 2024 and announced a 10-year extension and expansion of its exclusive co-branded credit card partnership with American Airlines, including the acquisition of the Barclays American Airlines co-branded card portfolio. This strategic move strengthens Citi\u2019s position in the credit card market. In contrast, Capital One\u2019s Retail Banking segment in 2023 saw only $10 million in loan modifications, with a total of $772 million in modified consumer banking loans, indicating a much smaller scale of portfolio activity and potentially less aggressive expansion in the retail credit space compared to Citi\u2019s strategic moves.",

Meanwhile, JPMorgan allocated $55.5 billion in equity to its Consumer & Community Banking segment in 2023, which includes auto loans among a broader suite of consumer financial products.

Similarly, SCHW explicitly includes economic value of equity as a key metric in its interest rate risk modeling and capital management planning.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nIn addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as 'believe,' 'anticipate,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'will,' 'may,' 'estimate,' 'appear,' 'could,' 'would,' 'expand,' 'aim,' 'maintain,' 'continue,' 'seek,' and other similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to ex pectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements, which reflect management's beliefs, objectives, and expectations as of the date hereof, are estimates based on the best judgment of Schwab's senior management. These statements relate to, among other things:\n\n- Maximizing our market valuation and stockholder returns over time; our belief that developing trusted relationships will translate into more client assets which drives revenue and, along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management, generates earnings growth and builds stockholder value (see Business Strategy and Competitive Environment, and Products and Services in Part I - Item 1);\n- Capital expenditures and expense management (see Results of Operations in Overview and Results of Operations - Total Expenses Excluding Interest in Part II - Item 7);\n- Net interest revenue, the adjustment of rates paid on client-related liabilities, and client cash realignment activity (see Results of Operations - Net Interest Revenue in Part II - Item 7);\n- Utilization of bank supplemental funding and expectations for repayment of outstanding balances (see Results of Operations in Part II - Item 7, and Liquidity Risk in Part II - Item 7);\n- Management of interest rate risk; modeling and assumptions, the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest margin and revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, economic value of equity, and liability and asset duration (see Risk Management in Part II - Item 7);\n- Sources and uses of liquidity (see Liquidity Risk in Part II - Item 7);\n- Capital management; potential migration of IDA balances to our balance sheet; capital accretion; expectations about capital requirements, including AOCI; long-term operating objective; and uses of capital and return of excess capital to stockholders, including dividends and repurchases (see Capital Management - Regulatory Capital Requirements in Part II - Item 7; and Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15);\n- The expected impact of proposed and final rules (see Current Regulatory and Other Developments in Part II - Item 7);\n- The expected impact of new accounting standards not yet adopted (see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 2);\n- The likelihood of indemnification and guarantee payment obligations and clients failing to fulfill contractual obligations (see Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15, and Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk - Client Trade Settlement in Note 18); and\n- The outcome and impact of legal proceedings and regulatory matters (see Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15, and Legal Proceedings in Part I - Item 3).\n\nAchievement of the expressed beliefs, objectives and expectations described in these statements is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the ex pressed beliefs, objectives, and ex pectations. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference, as of the date of those documents.\n\nImportant factors that may cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to:\n\n- General market conditions, including the level of interest rates, equity market valuations and volatility;\n- Our ability to attract and retain clients, develop trusted relationships, and grow client assets;\n- Client use of our advisory and lending solutions and other products and services;\n- The level of client assets, including cash balances;\n- Client cash allocations and sensitivity to deposit rates;\n- The level and mix of client trading activity, including daily average trades, margin balances, and balance sheet cash;\n- Regulatory guidance and adverse impacts from new or changed legislation, rulemaking or regulatory expectations;\n- Capital and liquidity needs and management;",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's client assets grew from $5.492 trillion to $6.588 trillion in 2023, representing a $1.096 trillion increase. Charles Schwab's Advisor Services platform depends on client assets for revenue, with its cost structure showing $78 million in compensation and benefits for Advisor Services in Q4. Given this fixed cost base and the potential flow of increased assets under management from Morgan Stanley's growth, Schwab's Advisor Services could see improved unit economics in 2023 as the same fixed costs would be spread over a larger asset base, potentially improving margins without proportional cost increases.",

      "answer": "A 200 basis point increase in credit spreads would likely reduce MetLife's investment portfolio valuation due to its sensitivity to credit spread changes, potentially increasing impairments and reducing earnings. This could constrain MetLife's ability to pay dividends if holding company cash flow is insufficient. Similarly, JPMorgan's AWM segment, which holds seed capital investments and co-invests in privately distributed collective vehicles, would face valuation declines in these instruments due to the same spread widening, affecting its earnings-at-risk and sensitivity-based measures.",

        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 Credit Spread Changes: MetLife's investment portfolio is directly impacted by credit spread changes, which can increase impairments, reduce earnings, and constrain dividend capacity if holding company cash flow is insufficient.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIf we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock or pay interest on our junior subordinated debentures or trust securities, terms of those instruments may restrict our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures or other securities.\n\n## Our Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\n\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. MetLife, Inc. may also not meet its free cash flow or shareholder cash distribution goals.\n\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required if they determine payments could be adverse to our  policyholders  or  contractholders.  Business  conditions,  rating  agency  considerations,  tax ation,  dividend  and  repatriation  rules,  and  monetary  transfer  and  foreign currency exchange rules may limit our insurance subsidiaries' dividends and other payments. We may need to transfer capital among our companies to comply with net worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\n\n## Investment Risks\n\n## We May Face Defaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events That Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold\n\nIn case of a major economic downturn, U.S. government default (or threatened default), acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events, our estimated fair value of our fix ed income securities and loan portfolios and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default rate of our investment portfolio may increase. These changes could harm the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels if securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fix ed income securities may increase our write-downs or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\n\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property type may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the prices we can obtain when we sell assets, and our results of operations or financial condition. Legislation or regulations that would allow or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans or other investments could harm our investment portfolio.\n\nMajor public health issues have affected and may continue to affect financial markets and our investment portfolio. These may continue to contribute to our risk of investment defaults, downgrades and volatility, asset impairments and lower variable investment income and returns, and may cause or exacerbate any of the investment risks we describe in these risk factors.\n\nMarket volatility affects the value of or return on our investments. It may slow or prevent us from reacting to market events as effectively as we otherwise could. When we sell our investment holdings, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value, due to reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption, or other reasons. Borrowers may delay or fail to pay principal and interest when due, or may demand loan modifications. Tenants may delay paying rent, or fail to pay it, or demand lease modifications. We may face moratoriums on foreclosures and other enforcement actions, impairments, and loan or lease modifications, due to government action or market conditions. We may also encounter credit spread changes, increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our product fee income. Issuer or guarantor default rates may increase.\n\n## We May Have Difficulty Selling Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner to Realize Their Full Value\n\nWhen we sell holdings in our investment portfolio, we may not receive the price we seek and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value. We may face unfavorable conditions in privately-placed fixed income securities, private structured credit, certain derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, direct financing and leveraged leases, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, private equity, and real estate equity, including real estate joint ventures and funds. Our investments may suffer reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption or for other reasons. In addition, central banks' efforts to provide market liquidity or otherwise address market conditions may not be successful or sufficient. We may realize losses that harm our financial metrics, which could harm our compliance with our credit requirements and rating agency capital adequacy measures.",

Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making, noncompliance with applicable laws and/or regulations or damage to the Firm's reputation. The risk inherent in a model  is  a  function  of  the  materiality,  complex ity  and  uncertainty  around inputs and assumptions.\n\nModel risk is generated from the use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory  filings,  capital  adequacy  assessments  and  the  formulation  of strategy.\n\nSound model  risk  management  is  an  integral  part  of  our  Risk  Management Framework. The Model Risk Management Department ('MRM') is a distinct department in Risk Management responsible for the oversight of model risk.\n\nThe MRM establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our risk appetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the materiality of the risk of financial loss  or  reputational  damage  due  to  errors  in  design,  implementation  and/or inappropriate  use  of  models.  The  tolerance  is  monitored  through  modelspecific  and  aggregate  business-level  assessments,  which  are  based  upon qualitative and quantitative factors.\n\nThe effective challenge of models consists of critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and drive appropriate  changes.  The  MRM  provides  effective  challenge  of  models, independently  validates  and  approves  models  for  use,  annually  recertifies models,  periodically  revalidates,  identifies  and  tracks  remediation  plans  for model  limitations  and  reports  on  model  risk  metrics.  The  department  also oversees  the  development  of  controls  to  support  a  complete  and  accurate Firmwide model inventory.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets.  Liquidity  risk  also  encompasses  our  ability  (or  perceived  ability)  to meet  our  financial  obligations  without  experiencing  significant  business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. Liquidity  risk  also  encompasses  the  associated  funding  risks triggered  by  the  market  or  idiosyncratic  stress  events  that  may  negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding or the cost of new funding. G enerally, we incur liquidity and funding risk as a result of our trading, lending, investing and client facilitation activities.\n\nOur Liquidity Risk Management Framework is critical to helping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves and durable funding sources to meet our  daily  obligations  and  to  withstand  unanticipated  stress  events.  The Liquidity Risk\n\nDecember 2024 Form 10-K\n\nDepartment  is  a  distinct  area  in  Risk  Management  responsible  for  the oversight  and  monitoring  of  liquidity  risk.  The  Liquidity  Risk  Department ensures transparency of material liquidity and funding risks, compliance with established  risk  limits  and  escalation  of  risk  concentrations  to  appropriate senior management.\n\nTo execute these responsibilities, the  Liquidity  Risk  Department establishes limits in line with our risk appetite, identifies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to ensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and  reports  risk  ex posures  against  metrics  and  limits,  and  reviews  the methodologies and assumptions underpinning our Liquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and funding under a range of adverse scenarios.\n\nThe  Treasury Department  and  applicable business  units  have  primary responsibility  for  evaluating,  monitoring  and  controlling  the  liquidity  and funding  risks arising from our business  activities and  for  maintaining processes and controls to manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. The Liquidity Risk Department coordinates with the Treasury Department  and  these  business  units  to  help  ensure  a  consistent  and comprehensive framework for managing liquidity and funding risk across the Firm. See also 'Management's Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations-Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources' herein.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk\n\nLegal, regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties,  judgments, damages and/or settlements, limitations on our business, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk,  such  as  the  risk  that  a  counterparty's  performance  obligations  will  be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, terrorist financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations.  We are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business (see also 'Business-Supervision and Regulation' and 'Risk Factors').\n\nWe have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. In addition, we  have  established  procedures  to  mitigate  the  risk  that  a  counterparty's performance  obligations  will  be  unenforceable,  including  consideration  of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy  or  insolvency  laws  limit  or  alter  contractual  remedies.

The Model Risk Management Department ('MRM') is a distinct department in Risk Management responsible for the oversight of model risk.\n\nThe MRM establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our risk appetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the materiality of the risk of financial loss  or  reputational  damage  due  to  errors  in  design,  implementation  and/or inappropriate  use  of  models.  The  tolerance  is  monitored  through  modelspecific  and  aggregate  business-level  assessments,  which  are  based  upon qualitative and quantitative factors.\n\nThe effective challenge of models consists of critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and drive appropriate  changes.  The  MRM  provides  effective  challenge  of  models, independently  validates  and  approves  models  for  use,  annually  recertifies models,  periodically  revalidates,  identifies  and  tracks  remediation  plans  for model  limitations  and  reports  on  model  risk  metrics.  The  department  also oversees  the  development  of  controls  to  support  a  complete  and  accurate Firmwide model inventory.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets.  Liquidity  risk  also  encompasses  our  ability  (or  perceived  ability)  to meet  our  financial  obligations  without  experiencing  significant  business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. Liquidity  risk  also  encompasses  the  associated  funding  risks triggered  by  the  market  or  idiosyncratic  stress  events  that  may  negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding or the cost of new funding. G enerally, we incur liquidity and funding risk as a result of our trading, lending, investing and client facilitation activities.\n\nOur Liquidity Risk Management Framework is critical to helping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves and durable funding sources to meet our  daily  obligations  and  to  withstand  unanticipated  stress  events.  The Liquidity Risk\n\nDecember 2024 Form 10-K\n\nDepartment  is  a  distinct  area  in  Risk  Management  responsible  for  the oversight  and  monitoring  of  liquidity  risk.  The  Liquidity  Risk  Department ensures transparency of material liquidity and funding risks, compliance with established  risk  limits  and  escalation  of  risk  concentrations  to  appropriate senior management.\n\nTo execute these responsibilities, the  Liquidity  Risk  Department establishes limits in line with our risk appetite, identifies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to ensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and  reports  risk  ex posures  against  metrics  and  limits,  and  reviews  the methodologies and assumptions underpinning our Liquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and funding under a range of adverse scenarios.\n\nThe  Treasury Department  and  applicable business  units  have  primary responsibility  for  evaluating,  monitoring  and  controlling  the  liquidity  and funding  risks arising from our business  activities and  for  maintaining processes and controls to manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. The Liquidity Risk Department coordinates with the Treasury Department  and  these  business  units  to  help  ensure  a  consistent  and comprehensive framework for managing liquidity and funding risk across the Firm. See also 'Management's Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations-Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources' herein.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk\n\nLegal, regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties,  judgments, damages and/or settlements, limitations on our business, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk,  such  as  the  risk  that  a  counterparty's  performance  obligations  will  be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, terrorist financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations.  We are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business (see also 'Business-Supervision and Regulation' and 'Risk Factors').\n\nWe have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. In addition, we  have  established  procedures  to  mitigate  the  risk  that  a  counterparty's performance  obligations  will  be  unenforceable,  including  consideration  of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy  or  insolvency  laws  limit  or  alter  contractual  remedies.

Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on MetLife, Inc.'s liquidity. MetLife, Inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of MetLife, Inc.'s liquidity and capital management. Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the financial markets could limit MetLife, Inc.'s access to liquidity.\n\nMetLife, Inc.'s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We view our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings. See '- The Company - Rating Agencies.'\n\n## Liquid Assets\n\nAt  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  MetLife  holding  companies  had  $5.1  billion  and  $5.2  billion,  respectively,  in  liquid  assets.  Of  these  amounts,  $4.2  billion  and $4.2 billion were held by MetLife, Inc. and $944 million and $1.0 billion were held by other MetLife holding companies at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Liquid assets  include  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments  and  publicly  traded  securities,  ex cluding  assets  that  are  pledged  or  otherwise  committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and the collateral financing arrangement.\n\nLiquid assets held in non-U.S. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-U.S. insurance operations. Such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in '- Liquidity and Capital Sources - Dividends from Subsidiaries.'\n\nSee '- Consolidated Company Outlook' for the targeted level of liquid assets at the holding companies.\n\nMetLife, Inc. and Other MetLife Holding Companies Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets and Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets included in Free Cash Flow\n\nMetLife, Inc.'s sources and uses of liquid assets, as well as sources and uses of liquid assets included in free cash flow, are summarized as follows:",

      "question": "Given MET's $1.851 billion fair value for 2019 fixed maturity securities and SCHW's 30% weighted-average expected volatility in the same year, how might these metrics reflect contrasting approaches to investment portfolio risk management, particularly considering MET's allocation to Aa and A-rated securities versus SCHW's equity-based volatility assumptions?",
      "answer": "MET's 2019 fixed maturity portfolio had a fair value of $1.851 billion, with significant allocations to Aa-rated ($141 million) and A-rated ($610 million) securities, indicating a relatively conservative fixed-income strategy focused on investment-grade assets. In contrast, SCHW reported a 30% weighted-average expected volatility for its equity-based compensation in 2019, which reflects a higher-risk profile typically associated with exposure to market fluctuations. The juxtaposition of MET\u2019s lower-risk, fixed-income positioning and SCHW\u2019s higher expected volatility suggests divergent risk management philosophies: MET prioritized capital preservation through credit quality, while SCHW\u2019s volatility assumption points to a strategy that incorporates greater market risk, likely tied to equity-based compensation and investment strategies.",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley\u2019s U.S. Bank Subsidiaries (MSBNA and MSPBNA) are benefiting from a five-year CECL transition deferral, with impacts phased in at 50% as of January 1, 2023, reducing immediate capital pressure. This phased-in approach allows them to maintain capital flexibility, which could support continued lending activities such as Securities-Based Lending. This aligns with the role of the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries in providing Securities-Based Lending to high net worth clients. In contrast, BAC reports $53.4 billion in Securities-Based Lending, which is typically backed by highly liquid collateral with minimal credit risk. Thus, while both firms engage in this type of lending, MS benefits from temporary capital relief that may enhance its capacity to manage and grow this segment relative to BAC, which does not benefit from the same deferral.",

      "answer": "COF's occupancy and equipment expense grew from $2,160 million in 2023 to $2,366 million in 2024, a 9.5% increase. In contrast, SCHW's occupancy and equipment expense includes accelerated amortization of ROU assets due to facility closures, which contributed to a higher volatility in this line item. For example, SCHW recognized significant restructuring and Ameritrade integration-related exit costs through December 31, 2024, including accelerated amortization of ROU assets tied to abandoned leased properties. This implies that part of SCHW\u2019s occupancy and equipment expense increase was driven by one-time or non-recurring charges related to accelerated amortization, whereas COF\u2019s increase appears more aligned with steady operational scaling. Therefore, the growth in SCHW\u2019s occupancy and equipment expense likely exceeded COF\u2019s when factoring in these closure-related charges, though exact figures for SCHW\u2019s 2024 expense are not provided.",

      "answer": "The significant 39.8% drop in Schwab's average daily money market deposits from $367.426 billion in 2022 to $233.091 billion in 2023 suggests a broader industry trend of declining deposit levels, which could increase funding costs for banks like Capital One that rely heavily on deposit funding. Capital One explicitly states that deposits, including money market accounts, are their largest funding source for assets and operations.

      "question": "How might a declining interest rate scenario affecting the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield impact the valuation of COF's RMBS and CMBS securities, given their sensitivity to yield assumptions?",
      "answer": "Under a declining interest rate scenario, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is projected to decrease from 1.73% (base scenario 2022) to 1.23%, which could lead to higher valuation pressures on COF's RMBS and CMBS securities. COF's RMBS portfolio, valued at $258 million in 2022, uses yield as a key unobservable input with a weighted average of 3%, while its CMBS portfolio, valued at $9 million, also relies on yield assumptions at 1%. A lower Treasury yield environment typically influences discount rates and prepayment expectations, which directly affect the discounted cash flow models used for these Level 3 fair value measurements. MET's modeling suggests such a scenario would materially alter interest rate benchmarks, reinforcing the sensitivity of these assets to macroeconomic conditions.",

        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 Yield: COF discloses that yield is a key unobservable input in the valuation of its RMBS and CMBS securities, with weighted averages of 3% and 1% respectively in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Yield \u2192 10-year U.S. Treasury: MET's modeling shows the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield could fall from 1.73% to 1.23% in a declining interest rate scenario, directly influencing discounting assumptions.",
        "Hop 3: 10-year U.S. Treasury \u2190 MET: MET explicitly discloses interest rate scenarios that model changes in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which provides context for how macroeconomic shifts affect financial instruments tied to yield assumptions."

      "answer": "PYPL's net revenues increased from $21,454 million in 2020 to $25,371 million in 2021, representing a year-over-year growth of 18.3%. In contrast, SCHW's Investor Services segment net revenues grew by 68% in 2021 compared to 2020, significantly outpacing PYPL's growth. This disparity in growth rates suggests that while PYPL pursued a more moderate, possibly organic growth strategy, SCHW's substantial increase was largely driven by the full-year consolidation of TD Ameritrade, indicating an aggressive inorganic expansion approach. The $200 million regulatory charge in 2021 for Investor Services also highlights the operational complexities and costs associated with integrating large acquisitions, which further differentiates SCHW's expansion model from PYPL's.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Segment Net Revenues\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 68% and 32%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. Both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results in 2021. In addition, net interest revenue increased for Advisor Services due to growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances. The increase in trading revenue for Investor Services was supported by heightened client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020, following the October 6, 2020 TD Ameritrade acquisition.\n\nInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services' growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets.\n\n## Segment Expenses Excluding Interest\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50% and 35%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of TD Ameritrade's results of operations. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, higher bonus accrual, as well as annual merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter (see Item 8 - Note 15).\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services' expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment's client base and greater client base growth from TDA.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSchwab's business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.\n\nOur risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.",

      "answer": "Capital One has indicated that its credit card portfolio performance correlates with the U.S. unemployment rate, which is a key economic indicator affecting consumer financial conditions and delinquency trends. Citigroup's forecast, as of December 2024, projects the U.S. unemployment rate to stabilize at 4.4% in the near term (June 2025 and December 2025). Citigroup itself has modeled unemployment at 4.4% for the first and third quarters of 2025, suggesting a relatively stable labor market. Given Capital One's exposure to consumer credit risk, a sustained unemployment rate at this level could influence delinquency migration patterns in their credit card portfolio, potentially leading to increased credit losses compared to periods of lower unemployment.",

        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 U.S. Unemployment Rate: Capital One explicitly cites the U.S. unemployment rate as a key economic factor influencing credit card portfolio performance and delinquency trends.",

We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. Real G ross Domestic Product ('GDP') growth rate, as well as consumers' financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card loan portfolio is delinquency trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time.\n\nThe table below presents our credit card portfolio by delinquency status as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Table 4.3: Credit Card Delinquency Status\n\n",

      "answer": "Capital One recorded a $519 million benefit for credit losses in its Commercial Banking segment, indicating an improvement in asset quality or a reduction in expected loan losses. This suggests a potential release of previously reserved capital as risk provisions were deemed unnecessary. In contrast, JPMorgan maintained a consistent $30.0 billion equity allocation to Commercial Banking from 2022 to 2023, signaling a more conservative capital buffer approach to absorb potential losses in the same segment. Together, these figures suggest that Capital One may be taking a more optimistic or dynamic view of credit risk, adjusting provisions downward, while JPMorgan is maintaining a stable capital commitment, possibly to prepare for sustained or uncertain credit conditions.",

      "answer": "MetLife's Group Benefits segment reported adjusted earnings of -$3 billion in 2023, which reflects significant volatility tied to market risk benefit remeasurement losses of $466 million in that year. These losses are directly linked to changes in policyholder benefits and claims expenses, which totaled $19.3 billion in 2023 for the segment. AIG, on the other hand, reported policyholder benefits and claims incurred of $0 in 2023, indicating a materially different exposure or accounting treatment in this category. This contrast suggests that MetLife's Group Benefits segment may face greater earnings instability tied to policyholder benefit volatility compared to AIG's exposure in the same category.",

      "answer": "COF reported a decrease in average deposits of $4.6 billion (11%) from 2022 to 2023, which contributed to a $55 million increase in net interest income due to a higher average deposit interest rate (from 0.73% to 2.68%). In contrast, BAC's GWIM segment experienced a $53.0 billion decline in average deposits, which led to a $319 million decrease in net interest income, primarily due to the drop in deposit balances despite a strategic shift to higher-yielding deposit products. This contrast highlights how the same trend in deposit balances had opposite effects on net interest income due to differences in business focus and interest rate positioning between COF and BAC's GWIM.",

        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 Average Deposits: COF's average deposits decreased by $4.6 billion (11%) from 2022 to 2023, with the average deposit interest rate rising from 0.73% to 2.68%, contributing to a $57 million increase in net interest income.",
        "Hop 2: Average Deposits \u2192 GWIM: BAC's GWIM segment saw a $53.0 billion decrease in average deposits, which was a key factor in the $319 million decline in net interest income, partially offset by a shift to higher-yielding deposit products.",
        "Hop 3: GWIM \u2190 BAC: GWIM is a key segment of BAC that includes Merrill Wealth Management and Bank of America Private Bank, and its net interest income was directly impacted by the drop in average deposits, despite strategic moves to higher-yielding products."

      "answer": "Citi's USPB segment reports that 77% of its EOP loans consist of credit card loans (Branded Cards and Retail Services), which account for approximately 95% of total USPB net credit losses in Q4 2024. These losses are primarily driven by the maturation of recent loan vintages and macroeconomic pressures from elevated inflation and interest rates, especially among lower FICO band customers. Similarly, Bank of America reports that higher net credit losses negatively impacted its total risk-adjusted margin, with credit card purchase volumes reaching $368.9 billion in 2024. Both institutions observe that lower FICO band customers are the primary contributors to rising credit losses under current economic conditions, indicating a parallel trend in credit risk exposure despite differing loan volumes and portfolio structures.",

A large majority of these institutional deposits are within TTS, and of these, approximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly 80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a longer than 15-year relationship with Citi.\n\nCiti also has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, with $402 billion of USPB and Wealth deposits as of year end, which are diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold and Wealth at Work within Wealth , as well as USPB , and across regions and products.

Retail Banking is concentrated in six  major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also provides mortgages through correspondent channels.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 77% of USPB EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of USPB , as Branded Cards and Retail Services net credit losses represented approximately 95% of total USPB net credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Branded Cards and Retail Services represented 69% and 31%, respectively, of EOP cards loans in USPB .\n\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in USPB was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.\n\nThe 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.\n\nUSPB 's Branded Cards portfolio consists of both proprietary Citi branded cards portfolios (Value, Rewards and Cash) and co-branded cards portfolios (including Costco and American Airlines). Citi's Branded Cards portfolio benefits from a diverse combination of products. Citi's proprietary cards provide customers with a suite of products with rewards, cash rebates and lending solutions, while co-branded cards provide significant affinity benefits through partnerships with large-scale partners across the airline, retail and telecom sectors.\n\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Branded Cards was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter.

      "answer": "BAC's ConsumerBanking segment maintained a constant value of $30,137 million in 2024, suggesting stable funding that could support consistent Auto financing activities. In contrast, COF's Auto loan portfolio totaled $2,674 million in 2024, with a payment delay duration of 6 months and an interest rate reduction of 8.72%, indicating a more dynamic and potentially risk-adjusted approach to Auto lending. This suggests that while BAC has a more stable foundation to support Auto financing, COF's Auto portfolio reflects active management with potential trade-offs in risk and return.",

Both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results in 2021. In addition, net interest revenue increased for Advisor Services due to growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances. The increase in trading revenue for Investor Services was supported by heightened client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020, following the October 6, 2020 TD Ameritrade acquisition.\n\nInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services' growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets.\n\n## Segment Expenses Excluding Interest\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50% and 35%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of TD Ameritrade's results of operations. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, higher bonus accrual, as well as annual merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter (see Item 8 - Note 15).\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services' expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment's client base and greater client base growth from TDA.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSchwab's business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.\n\nOur risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.",

      "answer": "AIG faces liquidity risk due to its exposure to credit spread changes, which can reduce the value and liquidity of its investment portfolio, particularly for less liquid assets such as private equity funds, hedge funds, and mortgage loans. AIG may be unable to sell these assets at carrying value in stressed market conditions, which could materially impact its liquidity and financial condition. In contrast, JPM's AWM segment manages credit spread volatility through derivative hedges and risk management strategies applied to its seed capital investments, which are typically made in privately distributed collective vehicles and third-party funds. These investments are explicitly included in JPM's sensitivity-based risk measures, allowing for active monitoring and mitigation of credit spread risk. This contrast highlights how JPM\u2019s AWM segment integrates credit spread risk management into its investment framework, while AIG\u2019s exposure remains a more direct liquidity vulnerability.",

There also may be cases where, due to the financial environment or market conditions, normally active markets become inactive or less active, which can result in insufficient observable data. A s a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods that are more complex. These values may not be realized in a market transaction, may not reflect the value of the asset and may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Decreases in value and/or an inability to realize that value in a market transaction or other disposition may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\n## LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL AND CREDIT\n\nAIG  Parent's ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited, and our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs, including providing capital that may be required by our subsidiaries.\n\nAs a holding company, AIG Parent depends on dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund operations, pay dividends, repurchase shares, meet debt service obligations and meet the capital and liquidity needs of our subsidiaries. The majority of our investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. A ny inability by our subsidiaries to make dividend or other payments in an amount sufficient to enable A IG Parent to meet its cash requirements could have an adverse effect on our operations or our business, results of operations, financial condition, capital and liquidity.\n\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to A IG Parent in the future will depend on their earnings, capital levels, tax considerations, covenants contained in any financing or other agreements, applicable regulatory restrictions and rating agency requirements. In addition, such payments could be limited as a result of claims against our subsidiaries by their creditors, including suppliers, vendors, lessors and employees. A dditionally, our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to make dividend payments to AIG Parent in the future because of the need to meet their obligations or to support their own capital levels or because of regulatory limits and restrictions or changes in, or interpretations of, regulatory or rating agency standards.\n\nOur decision to pursue strategic changes or transactions in our business and operations may also subject our subsidiaries' dividend plans to heightened regulatory scrutiny and could make obtaining regulatory approvals for extraordinary distributions by our subsidiaries, if required, more difficult. We are also subject to certain other restrictions on our capital from time to time.\n\nIf our liquidity  is insufficient to meet our needs, we may need to have recourse to third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity, which may not be available or could be expensive. The availability and cost of any additional financing at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability  of credit, regulatory  actions and our credit ratings and credit capacity . It is also possible that, as a result of such recourse to external financing, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. If A IG Parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a subsidiary, the credit rating agencies could downgrade the subsidiary's financial strength ratings or the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could be seized by its regulator.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are required to post collateral for our insurance company subsidiaries from time to time. We may be required to post additional collateral due to regulatory changes from time to time, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFor additional information on our liquidity, see Part II, Item 7. M D&amp;A - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\n\nWe may not be able to generate cash to meet our needs due to the illiquidity of some of our investments.\n\nWe have a diversified investment portfolio. However, economic conditions as well as adverse capital market conditions, including a lack of buyers, the inability of potential buyers to obtain financing on reasonable terms, volatility, credit spread changes, interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rates and/or declines in collateral v alues have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, the liquidity and value of our investments.\n\nWe have investments in certain securities, including certain fixed income structured and privately placed securities as well as investments in private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage loans and real estate, that are less liquid than other investments. If it became necessary to sell such assets in a stressed market environment, the prices achieved in any sale may be lower than their carrying value, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

      "answer": "MetLife utilizes internal liquidity risk metrics to monitor its $5.1 billion in liquid assets as of December 31, 2024, focusing on the composition, level, and access to short- and long-term funding sources. These metrics are critical for maintaining credit ratings and managing liquidity under potential market disruptions. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Liquidity Risk Department oversees a formal framework that includes setting risk limits aligned with risk appetite, monitoring exposures against those limits, and reviewing methodologies for Liquidity Stress Tests to ensure resilience under adverse scenarios. The department also coordinates with the Treasury and business units to enforce risk controls. Thus, while both firms rely on structured liquidity risk frameworks, Morgan Stanley emphasizes formal stress testing and limit enforcement through its dedicated department, whereas MetLife integrates liquidity metrics more broadly into its capital and market access strategy.",

Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on MetLife, Inc.'s liquidity. MetLife, Inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of MetLife, Inc.'s liquidity and capital management. Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the financial markets could limit MetLife, Inc.'s access to liquidity.\n\nMetLife, Inc.'s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We view our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings. See '- The Company - Rating Agencies.'\n\n## Liquid Assets\n\nAt  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  MetLife  holding  companies  had  $5.1  billion  and  $5.2  billion,  respectively,  in  liquid  assets.  Of  these  amounts,  $4.2  billion  and $4.2 billion were held by MetLife, Inc. and $944 million and $1.0 billion were held by other MetLife holding companies at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Liquid assets  include  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments  and  publicly  traded  securities,  ex cluding  assets  that  are  pledged  or  otherwise  committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and the collateral financing arrangement.\n\nLiquid assets held in non-U.S. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-U.S. insurance operations. Such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in '- Liquidity and Capital Sources - Dividends from Subsidiaries.'\n\nSee '- Consolidated Company Outlook' for the targeted level of liquid assets at the holding companies.\n\nMetLife, Inc. and Other MetLife Holding Companies Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets and Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets included in Free Cash Flow\n\nMetLife, Inc.'s sources and uses of liquid assets, as well as sources and uses of liquid assets included in free cash flow, are summarized as follows:",

Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making, noncompliance with applicable laws and/or regulations or damage to the Firm's reputation. The risk inherent in a model  is  a  function  of  the  materiality,  complex ity  and  uncertainty  around inputs and assumptions.\n\nModel risk is generated from the use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory  filings,  capital  adequacy  assessments  and  the  formulation  of strategy.\n\nSound model  risk  management  is  an  integral  part  of  our  Risk  Management Framework. The Model Risk Management Department ('MRM') is a distinct department in Risk Management responsible for the oversight of model risk.\n\nThe MRM establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our risk appetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the materiality of the risk of financial loss  or  reputational  damage  due  to  errors  in  design,  implementation  and/or inappropriate  use  of  models.  The  tolerance  is  monitored  through  modelspecific  and  aggregate  business-level  assessments,  which  are  based  upon qualitative and quantitative factors.\n\nThe effective challenge of models consists of critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and drive appropriate  changes.  The  MRM  provides  effective  challenge  of  models, independently  validates  and  approves  models  for  use,  annually  recertifies models,  periodically  revalidates,  identifies  and  tracks  remediation  plans  for model  limitations  and  reports  on  model  risk  metrics.

Liquidity  risk  also  encompasses  our  ability  (or  perceived  ability)  to meet  our  financial  obligations  without  experiencing  significant  business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. Liquidity  risk  also  encompasses  the  associated  funding  risks triggered  by  the  market  or  idiosyncratic  stress  events  that  may  negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding or the cost of new funding.

The  Liquidity  Risk  Department ensures transparency of material liquidity and funding risks, compliance with established  risk  limits  and  escalation  of  risk  concentrations  to  appropriate senior management.\n\nTo execute these responsibilities, the  Liquidity  Risk  Department establishes limits in line with our risk appetite, identifies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to ensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and  reports  risk  ex posures  against  metrics  and  limits,  and  reviews  the methodologies and assumptions underpinning our Liquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and funding under a range of adverse scenarios.\n\nThe  Treasury Department  and  applicable business  units  have  primary responsibility  for  evaluating,  monitoring  and  controlling  the  liquidity  and funding  risks arising from our business  activities and  for  maintaining processes and controls to manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas.

      "answer": "Capital One defines its net charge-off rate as annualized net charge-offs divided by average loans held for investment, which serves as a general indicator of credit risk across its loan portfolio. JPMorgan specifically reports that its scored auto net charge-off rate increased from 0.24% in 2022 to 0.56% in 2023, attributing this rise to declining used vehicle valuations. This context suggests that while Capital One provides a broad framework for understanding credit losses, JPMorgan's data reveals how specific market conditions\u2014such as depreciation in auto assets\u2014can directly elevate charge-off rates in the auto lending segment, aligning with the broader metric disclosed by Capital One.",

      "question": "How does the trend in unearned premiums liability for the Life and Retirement segment in 2023, as disclosed by AIG, compare to MetLife's recognition of unearned premiums as a liability, and what does this imply about the scale and timing of future earnings from unexpired coverage between the two companies?",
      "answer": "AIG reported an unearned premiums liability of $11 million for its Life and Retirement segment in 2023, compared to MetLife\u2019s accounting policy where unearned premiums are recognized as liabilities until earned, particularly for short-duration contracts. This implies that MetLife likely manages a significantly larger volume of short-duration policies with unexpired coverage, leading to a more substantial liability and deferred revenue base. Given that AIG's identifiable assets for Life and Retirement were $375,197 million in 2023, compared to MetLife\u2019s broader exposure across both long- and short-duration products, the lower unearned premiums liability at AIG suggests a different product mix or longer average duration in their Life and Retirement business, affecting the timing of future revenue recognition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 Unearned Premiums: MetLife discloses that unearned premiums represent the portion of premium written related to unexpired coverage and are reflected as liabilities until earned, particularly for short-duration contracts.",
        "Hop 2: Unearned Premiums \u2192 Life and Retirement: AIG reports a $11 million unearned premiums liability for its Life and Retirement segment in 2023, indicating the scale of unexpired coverage in that segment.",
        "Hop 3: Life and Retirement \u2190 AIG: AIG\u2019s Life and Retirement segment had $375,197 million in identifiable assets at year-end 2023, providing context for the scale and financial positioning of the segment that holds the $11 million unearned premiums liability."

Meanwhile, AIG's Life and Retirement segment was significantly impacted by variances in net investment income, which is a core component of its operating performance due to the investment-driven nature of its insurance liabilities and surplus.

      "answer": "At MS, Transactional revenues include Investment banking, Trading, and Commissions and Fees, with the latter recognized as part of a broader transactional activity segment. JPM's Commissions and Fees, on the other hand, are earned across multiple business units (CIB, CCB, and AWM) and include travel-related commissions, annuity sales commissions, and depositary receipt-related service fees, recognized as revenue when services are rendered. This indicates that while both firms report Commissions and Fees as part of revenue, JPM's sources are more diversified across service types and business units with explicit timing tied to service delivery.",

        "Hop 1: MS \u2192 Transactional: Transactional segment includes Investment banking, Trading, and Commissions and Fees revenues, indicating a bundled revenue model.",

      "answer": "PYPL reported a rise in its net charge-off rate for consumer loans in 2023, primarily due to deteriorating credit quality in its U.S. interest-bearing installment product and the sale of eligible consumer installment receivables. In response, PYPL implemented risk mitigation strategies that reduced originations. Similarly, JPM saw an increase in its scored auto net charge-off rate from 0.24% in 2022 to 0.56% in 2023, driven by declining used vehicle valuations. Both trends reflect broader macroeconomic pressures impacting consumer credit performance across different loan categories\u2014consumer installment loans at PYPL and scored auto loans at JPM.",

        "Hop 1: PYPL \u2192 Net Charge-Off Rate: PYPL's net charge-off rate increased in 2023 due to deteriorating credit quality and strategic changes in risk parameters.",
        "Hop 2: Net Charge-Off Rate \u2192 Scored Auto Net Charge-Off Rates: The increase in general net charge-off rates is mirrored in the auto sector, where JPM specifically notes a rise in scored auto net charge-off rates due to macroeconomic factors like declining used vehicle values.",
        "Hop 3: Scored Auto Net Charge-Off Rates \u2190 JPM: JPM reports a significant increase in scored auto net charge-off rates from 0.24% to 0.56% in 2023, indicating worsening credit performance in auto loans."

      "answer": "AIG reports statutory net income and capital and surplus for its General Insurance companies under standard statutory accounting practices without mention of special state-prescribed adjustments. In contrast, MetLife\u2019s U.S. Captive Life Reinsurance Subsidiaries, particularly MetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont (MRV), utilized a state-prescribed accounting practice with permission from the Vermont Commissioner of Insurance, allowing MRV to include letters of credit as admitted assets. This resulted in a $2.0 billion increase in statutory capital and surplus for MRV at both December 31, 2023, and 2022, and helped avoid a regulatory event under Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements. This shows that while AIG follows standard statutory reporting, MetLife employs targeted state-prescribed practices to manage regulatory capital in its captive reinsurance subsidiaries.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan reported $3,388 million in trading assets tied to municipal bond vehicles, while Goldman Sachs disclosed an average trading asset balance of $485,098 million for 2024. This suggests that JPMorgan's exposure to this specific fixed-income segment is relatively concentrated within municipal bond vehicles, whereas Goldman Sachs maintains a broader and significantly larger trading asset base across multiple fixed-income categories.

      "answer": "A 50 basis point increase in interest rates negatively impacts Charles Schwab's Economic Value of Equity, as indicated by their forward-looking modeling assumptions. For Capital One, the same 50 basis point increase also results in a negative impact on Economic Value of Equity, with a specific estimate of -1.4% in 2024. However, the context of these impacts differs: Schwab's sensitivity is part of broader interest rate risk management and modeling, while Capital One provides explicit quantitative estimates of the effect. This reveals that both institutions are exposed to interest rate risk, but Capital One provides more concrete forward-looking estimates of the sensitivity of its Economic Value of Equity to rate changes.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nIn addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as 'believe,' 'anticipate,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'will,' 'may,' 'estimate,' 'appear,' 'could,' 'would,' 'expand,' 'aim,' 'maintain,' 'continue,' 'seek,' and other similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to ex pectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements, which reflect management's beliefs, objectives, and expectations as of the date hereof, are estimates based on the best judgment of Schwab's senior management. These statements relate to, among other things:\n\n- Maximizing our market valuation and stockholder returns over time; our belief that developing trusted relationships will translate into more client assets which drives revenue and, along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management, generates earnings growth and builds stockholder value (see Business Strategy and Competitive Environment, and Products and Services in Part I - Item 1);\n- Capital expenditures and expense management (see Results of Operations in Overview and Results of Operations - Total Expenses Excluding Interest in Part II - Item 7);\n- Net interest revenue, the adjustment of rates paid on client-related liabilities, and client cash realignment activity (see Results of Operations - Net Interest Revenue in Part II - Item 7);\n- Utilization of bank supplemental funding and expectations for repayment of outstanding balances (see Results of Operations in Part II - Item 7, and Liquidity Risk in Part II - Item 7);\n- Management of interest rate risk; modeling and assumptions, the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest margin and revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, economic value of equity, and liability and asset duration (see Risk Management in Part II - Item 7);\n- Sources and uses of liquidity (see Liquidity Risk in Part II - Item 7);\n- Capital management; potential migration of IDA balances to our balance sheet; capital accretion; expectations about capital requirements, including AOCI; long-term operating objective; and uses of capital and return of excess capital to stockholders, including dividends and repurchases (see Capital Management - Regulatory Capital Requirements in Part II - Item 7; and Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15);\n- The expected impact of proposed and final rules (see Current Regulatory and Other Developments in Part II - Item 7);\n- The expected impact of new accounting standards not yet adopted (see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 2);\n- The likelihood of indemnification and guarantee payment obligations and clients failing to fulfill contractual obligations (see Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15, and Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk - Client Trade Settlement in Note 18); and\n- The outcome and impact of legal proceedings and regulatory matters (see Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15, and Legal Proceedings in Part I - Item 3).\n\nAchievement of the expressed beliefs, objectives and expectations described in these statements is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the ex pressed beliefs, objectives, and ex pectations. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference, as of the date of those documents.\n\nImportant factors that may cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to:\n\n- General market conditions, including the level of interest rates, equity market valuations and volatility;\n- Our ability to attract and retain clients, develop trusted relationships, and grow client assets;\n- Client use of our advisory and lending solutions and other products and services;\n- The level of client assets, including cash balances;\n- Client cash allocations and sensitivity to deposit rates;\n- The level and mix of client trading activity, including daily average trades, margin balances, and balance sheet cash;\n- Regulatory guidance and adverse impacts from new or changed legislation, rulemaking or regulatory expectations;\n- Capital and liquidity needs and management;",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's adjusted average assets increased from $1,159.626 billion in 2023 to $1,223.779 billion in 2024, a growth of $64.153 billion. These adjusted average assets are defined as the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets, adjusted for certain deductions. In comparison, Bank of America reported on-balance sheet assets of $29.727 billion in 2024, which is significantly smaller in scale. This suggests that Morgan Stanley's on-balance sheet asset base, as part of its broader adjusted average assets, is much larger than that of Bank of America, reflecting differences in the overall size and regulatory capital structure of the two institutions.",

      "answer": "AIG capitalizes $10.01 billion in deferred policy acquisition costs as of 2023, backed by $375.197 billion in identifiable assets in its Life and Retirement segment, suggesting a significant investment in policy acquisition that is amortized over time. MET, on the other hand, amortizes DAC on a constant-level basis approximating straight-line amortization for most long-duration products, with RIS annuities amortized over expected benefit payments. This means AIG's financial statements reflect a large capitalized asset that may smooth earnings volatility, while MetLife's approach ties amortization directly to policyholder behavior and benefit payout expectations, potentially leading to more variable expense recognition.",

        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Life and Retirement: AIG's Life and Retirement segment holds $375.197 billion in identifiable assets as of 2023, indicating substantial capital backing its insurance operations.",
        "Hop 2: Life and Retirement \u2192 Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs: AIG reports $10.01 billion in deferred policy acquisition costs for Life and Retirement in 2023, representing capitalized expenses for acquiring insurance contracts.",
        "Hop 3: Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs \u2190 MET: MetLife amortizes deferred policy acquisition costs either on a constant-level basis approximating straight-line amortization or in proportion to expected benefit payments for RIS annuities, directly linking expense recognition to policyholder behavior."

      "answer": "MetLife's declining interest rate scenario projects a drop in 30-year Treasury yields from 1.97% in 2022 to 1.52% in 2024, indicating a broader decline in market yields. Capital One values its Level 3 RMBS securities using a 3% weighted average yield assumption. As broader yields decline, the relative attractiveness of RMBS assets may increase, potentially increasing their fair value. However, Capital One\u2019s static 3% yield assumption may not fully reflect the downward trend in market yields, possibly leading to overvaluation if market participants adjust their expectations downward toward 1.52% by 2024.",

      "answer": "MS reported that higher yields on its investment portfolio partially offset a 10% decrease in net interest revenues in 2024, indicating a positive but limited benefit from yield increases. Meanwhile, AIG's General Insurance segment actively allocated to asset classes offering 'higher yields through structural and illiquidity premiums,' particularly in North America, with an average duration of 4.2 years for fixed maturity securities. The General Insurance portfolio also included alternative investments historically achieving yields exceeding those of the fixed maturity portfolio. This suggests that while both firms benefit from higher yields, AIG's strategic asset allocation gives it a more pronounced sensitivity to yield increases compared to MS's more passive exposure within a broader context of declining net interest income.",

These  factors,  along  with  other developments,  such  as  pricing  changes  to  certain  deposit  types  due  to various competitive dynamics, have impacted our net interest income. To the extent they persist, or other factors arise, such as central bank actions and changes in the path of interest rates, net interest income may be impacted in future periods.\n\n## Provision for Credit Losses\n\nThe  Provision  for  credit  losses  on  loans  and  lending  commitments  of  $62 million in 2024 was primarily related to certain specific commercial real estate and securities-based loans, and portfolio growth, partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $131 million in 2023 was primarily related to  deteriorating  conditions  in  the  commercial  real  estate  sector  including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio.\n\nFor further information on the Provision for credit losses, see 'Credit  Risk' herein.\n\n## Non-Interest E xpenses\n\nNon-interest expenses of $20,618 million in 2024 increased 5% compared with the  prior  year,  as  a  result  of  higher  Compensation  and  benefits  ex penses, partially offset by lower Non-compensation expenses.\n\n- Compensation and benefits expenses increased, primarily due to an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives on higher compensable revenues.\n- Non-compensation expenses decreased, primarily driven by lower professional services and legal expenses and lower FDIC special assessment cost, partially offset by higher technology spend.\n\n## Fee-Based Client Assets R ollforwards\n\n",

General Insurance invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies have an average duration of 3.8 years, with an average of 4.2 years for North A merica and 3.0 years for International.\n\nWhile invested assets backing reserves of the General Insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional liquid fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate to asset classes that offer higher yields through structural and illiquidity premiums, particularly in our North A merica operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fix ed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates and inflation. We seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks.\n\nIn addition, a portion of the surplus of General Insurance companies is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments that seek to balance liquidity, volatility and growth of surplus. A lthough these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio y ields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.\n\n## Available-for-Sale Investments\n\nThe following table presents the fair value of our available-for-sale securities:\n\n",

      "answer": "BNY Mellon's Securities Services segment is central to its business, housing key operations such as global custody, asset servicing, and collateral management, with a global presence across Europe and other major financial centers. This focus positions BNY Mellon as a leading global custodian with $52.1 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration as of December 31, 2024. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase's Commercial & Investment Bank integrates Securities Services as one component within its broader Markets & Securities Services business, which also includes global market-making, prime brokerage, and risk management solutions. This structure allows JPMorgan to bundle custody and fund services with a wider array of capital markets offerings, serving a global institutional client base. Therefore, while both firms offer custody and securities services, BNY Mellon's strategic emphasis on this segment gives it a more specialized and concentrated value proposition, whereas JPMorgan leverages it as part of a diversified institutional services suite.",

      "answer": "Bank of America's allowance for credit losses modeling assumes 1.8% year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth in Q4 2026, which reflects a moderately optimistic macroeconomic outlook. MetLife, in contrast, extended maturities on $522 million of commercial loans in 2024, increasing weighted average life by 2 years while maintaining a 1.0% book value yield. This maturity extension strategy suggests MetLife is positioning its commercial loan portfolio to capture longer-term returns, but may expose it to greater risk if the assumed GDP growth of 1.8% does not materialize, particularly given the sensitivity of commercial assets to economic cycles.",

          "chunk_text": "Credit  card  and  other  consumer  loans  are  deemed  to  be  in  payment  default during  the  quarter  in  which  a  borrower  misses  the  second  of two  consecutive payments.  Payment  defaults  are  one  of  the  factors  considered  when  projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer.\n\n## Commercial Loans\n\nDuring 2022, the carrying value of the Corporation's commercial loans that were modified  as  TDRs  was $1.9 billion.  At December  3 1,  2022,  the  Corporation  had commitments  to  lend  $358  million  to  commercial  borrowers  whose  loans  were classified as TDRs. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was $105 million at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe Corporation had LHFS of $9.5 billion and $6.0 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified  as  LHFS  were  $32.3 billion, $16.3  billion  and  $32.0  billion  for  202 4, 2023 and 2022. Cash used for originations and purchases of LHFS totaled $36.2 billion, $15.6 billion and $24.9 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022. Also included were non-cash net transfers into LHFS of $0, $632 million and $1.9 billion during 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Accrued Interest Receivable\n\nAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans held-for-sale was $4.3 billion  and  $4.5  billion  at  December  3 1,  202 4  and  2023  and  is  reported  in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOutstanding credit  card  loan  balances  include  unpaid  principal,  interest  and fees. Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within  60  days  after  receipt  of  notification  of  death  or  bankruptcy ,  or  upon confirmation  of  fraud.  During  202 4,  the  Corporation  reversed  $856  million  of interest and fee income against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan compared to $584 million in 2023.\n\nFor the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during 202 4 and 2023, interest  and  fee  income  reversed  at  the  time  the  loans  were  classified  as nonperforming  was  not  significant.  For  more  information  on  the  Corporation's nonperforming  loan  policies,  see Note  1  -  Summary  of  Significant  Accounting Principles.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  estimated  using  quantitative  and  qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not adequately be reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the\n\n125 Bank of Am erica\n\nweighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends. For more information on  the  Corporation's  credit  loss  accounting  policies  including  the  allowance  for credit losses, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles .\n\nThe December 3 1, 202 4 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic scenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates,  an  adverse  scenario  reflecting  an  extended  moderate  recession,  a downside scenario reflecting continued inflation and interest rates with minimal rate cuts, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario. The overall weighted economic outlook of the above scenarios has  improved  compared  to  the  weighted  economic  outlook  estimated  as  of December 3 1, 2023. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment rate will be just below five percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 and will  remain  near  this  level  th rough  th e  fourth   quarter  of  2026.  Th e  weigh ted economic outlook assumes steady growth with U.S. real gross domestic product forecasted  to  grow  at 1.4  percent  and 1.8  percent  year-over-year  in  the  fourth quarters of 2025 and 2026.\n\nThe  allowance  for  credit  losses  decreased  $215  million  from  December  3 1, 2023 to $14.3 billion at December 3 1, 202 4. The change in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net decrease of $102 million in the allowance for loan and  lease  losses  and  a  decrease  of  $113  million  in  the  reserve  for  unfunded lending commitments. The decline in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to decreases in the commercial portfolio of $ 240 million and the consumer real estate portfolio of $118 million, partially offset by an increase in the credit card and other consumer portfolios of $ 143 million. The provision for credit losses increased $1.4 billion to $5.8  billion  in  202 4  compared  to  $4.4  billion  in  2023  and  $2.5 billion in 2022. The increase in provision for credit losses in 202 4 was primarily driven  by  credit  card  as  well  as  small  b usiness  loan  growth ,  and   asset  quality deterioration  in  th e  commercial  real  estate  office  and   cred it  card   p ortfolios.  Th e increase  in  provision  for  credit  losses  in  2023  was  driven  by  th e  Corporation's consumer  portfolio  primarily  due  to  credit  card  loan  growth  and  asset  quality deterioration, partially offset by improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited the Corporation's commercial portfolio.\n\nOutstanding  loans  and  leases  excluding  loans  accounted  for  under  the  fair value option increased $41.4 billion in 202 4 primarily driven by commercial, which increased $36.4 billion due to broad-based growth.\n\nThe changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net charge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed in the following table.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings.\n\nOur interest expense was approximately $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease. As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on our annual net interest income of up to $206 million. A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change if benchmark interest rates change. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see 'Risk Management - Market Risk Management Process' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## The discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements.\n\nCertain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements will need to be amended or otherwise modified to replace references to the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) with an alternative reference rate, as the LIBOR tenors referenced are expected to be quoted only through June 2023. Alternative reference rates, such as the secured overnight financing rate, are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate differently than, and not be representative of, LIBOR. In order to compensate for these differences, certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment. However, there is no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR, either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements.\n\nUncertainty as to the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference rates and the discontinuance of LIBOR generally may negatively impact market liquidity, our access to funding and the trading market for our financial instruments. Furthermore, the timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could be subject to disputes, could cause the interest payable on our outstanding financial instruments and commercial agreements to be materially different than expected and may impact the value of such instruments and agreements.\n\n## Adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\n\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. Additional factors affecting the extent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## Any reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRatings of our long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, and the macroeconomic environment. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends, in part, on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts. If we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of our asset-backed securities, it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets.\n\n## Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital.\n\nDuring 2021, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them. Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign",

      "question": "How do Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase differ in their treatment of on-balance sheet assets for leverage ratio calculations, based on their respective disclosures around Adjusted Average Assets?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley discloses that Adjusted Average Assets, which forms the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio, is calculated using the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets, reduced by specific disallowed items such as goodwill, intangible assets, and investments in covered funds. This adjustment directly impacts the firm's leverage ratio by reducing the asset base. JPMorgan Chase also references Adjusted Average Assets in its leverage ratio calculations, but emphasizes inclusion of on-balance sheet assets adjusted for regulatory capital transitions, such as the CECL capital transition provisions. The differences in how each firm discloses its treatment of on-balance sheet assets and regulatory adjustments suggest variations in how they manage capital adequacy under similar regulatory frameworks.",

        "Hop 1: MS \u2192 Adjusted Average Assets: MS discloses that Adjusted Average Assets includes the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets, reduced by disallowed items like goodwill and intangible assets.",

      "answer": "AIG's net investment income increased by $536 million in 2023, primarily driven by higher base portfolio income. In contrast, MetLife Holdings' segment net investment income declined from $1,031 million in 2022 to $733 million in 2023, a decrease of $298 million. The MetLife Holdings segment reports that 26% of its net investment income comes from equity method investments, which suggests that its investment performance is partially tied to external market conditions similar to AIG\u2019s base portfolio income drivers. However, while AIG experienced a positive swing in investment returns, MetLife Holdings saw a contraction, indicating divergent investment outcomes despite potential shared exposure to market-linked assets.",

These adjusted average assets are a core component of the supplementary leverage exposure, which also adds adjustments for derivatives, repo-style transactions, and off-balance sheet exposures. BAC reported a supplementary leverage exposure of $3,818 billion under the Advanced Approaches as of December 31, 2024, indicating the inclusion of these additional adjustments beyond adjusted average assets.

      "answer": "AIG's 2024 segment realignment incorporated Net Investment Income as a core part of its General Insurance business, indicating that this metric is critical to evaluating segment performance, though AIG did not disclose specific Net Investment Income figures for General Insurance. In contrast, MET explicitly reported $5,099 million in Net Investment Income for its Asia segment in 2024. This suggests that while both companies rely on Net Investment Income as a key performance metric, MET provides more granular visibility into its capital deployment success in specific regions, whereas AIG integrates it more holistically into broader insurance operations without isolating its contribution per segment.",

Our CODMs are the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO). The CODM s evaluate performance of the segments based on underwriting income (loss). The CODMs use this measure to benchmark AIG's performance, assessing performance of the segments and in establishing management's compensation.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, AIG reports the results of its businesses through three segments and Other Operations. The three segments are North A merica Commercial, International Commercial and Global Personal. Other Operations predominantly consists of Net Investment Income from our A IG Parent liquidity portfolio, Corebridge dividend income, corporate General operating expenses, and Interest expense. Prior years' presentations have been recast to conform to the new reportable segments. Our General Insurance business (General Insurance) consists of our three segments and the Net investment income related to our insurance operations.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n53",

      "answer": "AXP reported an average interest rate reduction of 3 percentage points for 'Other Loans' in its 2021 troubled debt restructurings, affecting $13 million in account balances across 4,000 accounts. Meanwhile, MET disclosed a significantly larger exposure to 'Other Loans' with an estimated fair value of $4,223 million as of December 31, 2021, representing 22.7% of its total collateral type portfolio. This suggests that while AXP's focus in this category is limited in scale and involves modest rate reductions, MET holds a substantial and diversified position in other loans, potentially indicating differing risk appetites or strategies in loan portfolio management and restructuring.",

      "answer": "MetLife's Residential Portfolio Segment saw nonaccrual loans decrease from $534 million in 2020 to $442 million in 2021, a decline of $92 million or 17.2%. Meanwhile, Charles Schwab's nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total year-end loans dropped from 0.37% in 2020 to 0.10% in 2021, indicating a significant reduction in credit risk exposure. This suggests both firms improved their credit quality in residential lending, but MetLife experienced a larger absolute reduction in nonperforming assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 Residential Portfolio Segment: MetLife discloses $534 million in nonaccrual loans for its Residential Portfolio Segment in 2020 and $442 million in 2021.",
        "Hop 2: Residential Portfolio Segment \u2192 Nonaccrual Loans: The Residential Portfolio Segment includes the nonaccrual loan figures that are critical for understanding credit risk exposure in residential lending.",
        "Hop 3: Nonaccrual Loans \u2190 SCHW: Charles Schwab reports nonaccrual loans as 0.37% of total loans in 2020 and 0.10% in 2021, showing a downward trend similar to MetLife\u2019s but expressed as a percentage rather than absolute value."

      "question": "What does the 12.5% year-over-year growth in JPM's Commercial & Investment Bank segment suggest about the effectiveness of its market-making strategy compared to Goldman Sachs' capital markets activities, given both firms highlight market-making as a core component of their institutional services?",
      "answer": "JPM's Commercial & Investment Bank segment grew from $132.0 billion in 2023 to $149.5 billion in 2024, representing a 12.5% increase, which suggests a strong expansion in its institutional services, including market-making. This growth is tied to the firm's strategic integration of the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking into a unified segment, enhancing its capital markets offerings. JPM explicitly states that its Markets business under CIB operates as a global market-maker across cash and derivative instruments, offering risk management and trading services. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs also engages in market-making as part of its broader institutional client services, though its 2024 filing notes that such activities are conducted in the 'ordinary course of business' alongside other services like securities lending and custody. However, GS does not disclose specific growth metrics for its market-making activities. Therefore, while both firms emphasize market-making, JPM's quantifiable segment growth indicates a more pronounced strategic emphasis and execution success in leveraging this function compared to GS, which provides less granular performance data on the same.",

The  allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is  measured  using  a  modeled  approach.  These  models  determine  the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including  internal  credit  ratings,  industry  default  and  loss  data,  expected life  and  macroeconomic  indicators  (the  most  significant  to  the  forecast model  being  the  forecasted  U.S.  unemployment  and  U.S.  GDP  growth rates),  the  borrower's  capacity  to  meet  its  financial  obligations,  the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The  allowance  for  credit  losses  also  includes  qualitative  components which  allow  management  to  reflect  the  uncertain  nature  of  economic forecasting,  capture  uncertainty  regarding  model  inputs,  and  account  for model imprecision and concentration risk.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures  relating  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the  wholesale loan  portfolio  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  (i)  the  significant  judgment  by management  when  developing  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the wholesale  loan  portfolio  using  a  modeled  approach,  (ii)  a  high  degree  of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence  related  to  management's  internal  credit  ratings,  forecasted  U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n130\n\nGoldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nAddressing  the  matter  involved  performing  procedures  and  evaluating audit  evidence  in  connection  with  forming  our  overall  opinion  on  the consolidated  financial  statements.  These  procedures  included  testing  the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, including controls over the determination of management's internal credit ratings, forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting. These procedures also included, among  others, (i) testing management's  process for developing the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using  a  modeled  approach  (ii)  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of data  used  in  the  estimate,  and  (iii)  the  involvement  of  professionals  with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of the forecast model and methodology used by management  (b)  the  reasonableness of management's  internal credit ratings,  forecasted  U.S.  unemployment  and  U.S.  GDP  growth  rates,  and (c) the reasonableness of the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nNew York, New York February 26, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1922.",

      "question": "How does the credit loss exposure in MET's Residential Segment, measured as ACL as a percentage of amortized cost, compare to COF's overall credit loss allowance strategy based on their respective 2021 disclosures?",
      "answer": "MET's Residential Segment reported an ACL of $206 million, which is 1.8% of its amortized cost of $11,196 million in 2021. This indicates a relatively moderate credit loss exposure for MET in this segment. COF also disclosed its allowance for credit losses (ACL) in its Loans Held for Investment, although the exact ACL percentage is not provided in the evidence. However, the structure of COF's disclosure suggests a focus on quantifying credit risk across its portfolio segments, similar to MET's approach. Therefore, while MET's Residential Segment shows a specific 1.8% ACL ratio, COF's broader strategy appears aligned with industry practices, though the exact comparative position cannot be fully determined without the specific ACL percentage from COF's data.",

      "answer": "AXP extended payment terms for Other Loans by an average of 16 months in 2021, indicating a strategy to support financially distressed borrowers through modified repayment schedules. Meanwhile, AIG reported $0 in net charge-offs for Other Loans in 2021, contrasting with $5 million in net charge-offs in 2020, suggesting a relatively favorable credit outcome despite economic pressures. Together, this indicates that while AXP proactively adjusted payment terms to mitigate defaults, AIG experienced limited actual losses in this category, potentially reflecting either stronger underwriting standards or earlier-stage delinquencies that had not yet resulted in significant write-offs.",

      "question": "How does JPM's Asset & Wealth Management segment exposure to credit spread changes compare with MET's sensitivity to similar market risks, particularly in terms of their respective investment portfolios and risk mitigation strategies?",
      "answer": "JPM's Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) segment is exposed to credit spread changes through its seed capital investments, co-investments, and related hedges, which are classified as derivatives. These exposures arise from market risks such as adverse movements in credit spreads, which can affect the value of privately distributed collective vehicles and third-party funds in which AWM invests. Similarly, MET notes that credit spread changes can increase its borrowing costs and reduce product fee income, particularly affecting its fixed income securities and loan portfolios. MET also highlights that widening credit risk spreads can lead to declines in the fair value of its investments and corresponding earnings, with potential increases in default rates. Both firms face material risks from credit spread volatility, though JPM focuses on derivative-based hedges while MET emphasizes capital adequacy and regulatory constraints in managing these exposures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JPM \u2192 AWM: JPM's AWM segment engages in seed capital investments and co-investments in privately distributed funds and third-party funds, which are exposed to market risks including credit spreads.",
        "Hop 2: AWM \u2192 Credit Spread Changes: AWM's risk profile includes sensitivity to adverse movements in credit spreads, which are managed through derivative instruments and impact the value of its investment vehicles.",
        "Hop 3: Credit Spread Changes \u2190 MET: MET identifies credit spread changes as a key risk factor that can increase borrowing costs, reduce product fee income, and negatively affect the valuation and performance of its fixed income and loan portfolios."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIf we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock or pay interest on our junior subordinated debentures or trust securities, terms of those instruments may restrict our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures or other securities.\n\n## Our Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\n\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. MetLife, Inc. may also not meet its free cash flow or shareholder cash distribution goals.\n\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required if they determine payments could be adverse to our  policyholders  or  contractholders.  Business  conditions,  rating  agency  considerations,  tax ation,  dividend  and  repatriation  rules,  and  monetary  transfer  and  foreign currency exchange rules may limit our insurance subsidiaries' dividends and other payments. We may need to transfer capital among our companies to comply with net worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\n\n## Investment Risks\n\n## We May Face Defaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events That Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold\n\nIn case of a major economic downturn, U.S. government default (or threatened default), acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events, our estimated fair value of our fix ed income securities and loan portfolios and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default rate of our investment portfolio may increase. These changes could harm the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels if securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fix ed income securities may increase our write-downs or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\n\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property type may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the prices we can obtain when we sell assets, and our results of operations or financial condition. Legislation or regulations that would allow or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans or other investments could harm our investment portfolio.\n\nMajor public health issues have affected and may continue to affect financial markets and our investment portfolio. These may continue to contribute to our risk of investment defaults, downgrades and volatility, asset impairments and lower variable investment income and returns, and may cause or exacerbate any of the investment risks we describe in these risk factors.\n\nMarket volatility affects the value of or return on our investments. It may slow or prevent us from reacting to market events as effectively as we otherwise could. When we sell our investment holdings, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value, due to reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption, or other reasons. Borrowers may delay or fail to pay principal and interest when due, or may demand loan modifications. Tenants may delay paying rent, or fail to pay it, or demand lease modifications. We may face moratoriums on foreclosures and other enforcement actions, impairments, and loan or lease modifications, due to government action or market conditions. We may also encounter credit spread changes, increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our product fee income. Issuer or guarantor default rates may increase.\n\n## We May Have Difficulty Selling Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner to Realize Their Full Value\n\nWhen we sell holdings in our investment portfolio, we may not receive the price we seek and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value. We may face unfavorable conditions in privately-placed fixed income securities, private structured credit, certain derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, direct financing and leveraged leases, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, private equity, and real estate equity, including real estate joint ventures and funds. Our investments may suffer reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption or for other reasons. In addition, central banks' efforts to provide market liquidity or otherwise address market conditions may not be successful or sufficient. We may realize losses that harm our financial metrics, which could harm our compliance with our credit requirements and rating agency capital adequacy measures.",

      "question": "How does the distribution of Bank of America's (BAC) credit exposure in the 1-5 year maturity range compare to Morgan Stanley's (MS) portfolio of Loans, net of ACL, and what implications does this have for their respective risk profiles in the intermediate-term credit market?",
      "answer": "Bank of America (BAC) reported that 76% of its net credit default protection exposure falls in the 1-5 year maturity range as of December 31, 2024, indicating a significant concentration in intermediate-term credit risk. Morgan Stanley (MS), on the other hand, disclosed $2,564 billion in Loans, net of ACL, within the same 1-5 year maturity bucket as of December 31, 2023. Given that the 1-5 year maturity range is a key segment for both firms, BAC's higher percentage allocation to this segment suggests a comparatively greater reliance on short-to-intermediate term credit exposure, which could imply different sensitivities to credit cycles and interest rate fluctuations compared to MS's more balanced exposure across maturities.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 1-5 Years: BAC disclosed that 76% of its net credit default protection exposure falls in the 1-5 year maturity range as of December 31, 2024.",

        "Hop 3: Loans, net of ACL \u2190 MS: MS disclosed $2,564 billion in Loans, net of ACL, for the 1-5 year maturity range, which allows for a comparative analysis of credit risk exposure with BAC."

      "answer": "MET's MetLife Holdings segment derived only 5% of its segment net investment income from equity method investments in 2022, indicating a relatively modest reliance on this income source. In contrast, AIG's Life and Retirement segment was 'significantly impacted' by variances in net investment income, as this income stream directly affects the asset portfolios supporting insurance liabilities and surplus. This suggests AIG had a higher operational sensitivity to investment income performance compared to MET's MetLife Holdings segment in 2022.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan's commercial real estate loan exposure includes $6.1 billion of investment-grade retained interests and $1.7 billion of noninvestment-grade retained interests as of December 31, 2023. Morgan Stanley\u2019s U.S. Bank Subsidiaries engage in commercial real estate lending as part of their Institutional Securities business segment. These subsidiaries must comply with OCC\u2019s PCA standards, remaining well-capitalized, and as of 2023, MSBNA and MSPBNA capital ratios are based on the Standardized Approach rules with CECL adoption effects deferred over a five-year transition period. This shows that while both firms are exposed to commercial real estate through loans, Morgan Stanley\u2019s subsidiaries face stricter regulatory capital compliance requirements, while JPMorgan provides detailed risk ratings and retained interest figures.",

In contrast, Bank of America (BAC) reported that the percentage of its credit exposure in the 1-5 year maturity bucket rose from 64% in 2023 to 76% in 2024. While both institutions are increasing focus on this maturity range, MS's increase is in absolute dollar terms, whereas BAC's shift is expressed as a proportional increase within its overall credit portfolio.

In contrast, American Express had 9,000 troubled debt restructured accounts in this category in 2020, with 3,000 of those accounts subsequently defaulting, representing a 33% default rate.

      "answer": "MET reported a decrease in residential past due loans from $556 million in 2020 to $450 million in 2021, indicating an improvement in delinquency trends for this segment. In contrast, COF disclosed that all past due loans in their commercial banking portfolio, both performing and nonperforming, were evaluated using internal risk ratings as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. This suggests that while MET experienced a measurable reduction in delinquencies in its residential segment, COF maintained a more structured internal risk evaluation framework for its commercial loans, which may reflect differing credit quality management approaches between the two institutions.",

      "answer": "MetLife's divestiture of its Hong Kong operations in 2019\u20132020 resulted in a total net loss of $129 million, which was reflected in its net investment gains (losses), directly affecting the Asia segment's investment income. In comparison, AIG's Life and Retirement segment is significantly impacted by variances in net investment income, as these returns are critical for supporting insurance liabilities and surplus. Specifically, MetLife's Asia segment derived 9% of its net investment income from equity method investments, highlighting the segment's sensitivity to such transactions, while AIG's operations emphasize the strategic importance of stable investment returns to manage life and annuity obligations.",

Economic value of equity is calculated based on our existing assets, liabilities and derivatives, and does not incorporate projected changes in our balance sheet. Key assumptions used in this calculation include the term structure of interest rates, as well as deposit repricing and liquidation profiles used to inform duration and cash flow schedules. The economic value of equity is calculated under multiple interest rate scenarios, including baseline and immediate upward and immediate downward interest rate shocks, to assess its sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Our current sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases in a declining interest rate scenario and increases in an increasing interest rate scenario. The level of this sensitivity is managed within board-approved policy limits.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.\n\nThese foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2024, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $43 billion were outstanding.\n\nWith respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of December 31, 2024. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2024. With respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the nex t twelve months, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net of hedges, would be approximately $136 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nThe actual impact of interest rate and foreign ex change rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.",

In contrast, SCHW disclosed $184 million in average 'Other Loans' with a 0.54% net charge-off rate for the same year, suggesting a relatively higher credit risk exposure but with active loss mitigation.

      "answer": "Citi's Mexico Consumer/SBMM business reported $42 billion in deposits as of December 31, 2024. JPMorgan, in its Retail Banking segment, manages consumer deposits through a funds transfer pricing (FTP) mechanism that was updated in Q4 2024, resulting in a higher funding benefit for consumer deposits reflected in CCB's net interest income.

The previously announced wind-down of Citi's consumer business in China is substantially complete. See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises' consumer banking business sales and wind-downs. For additional information about Citi's continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see 'Risk Factors' and 'Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia' below.\n\nMexico Consumer/SBMM operates primarily through Banamex and provides traditional retail banking and branded card products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to commercial customers, as well as retirement fund administration and insurance products through certain Banamex affiliate entities. As previously disclosed, Citi completed the separation of Mexico Consumer/SBMM from its Services , Markets , Banking and Wealth businesses in Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2024, and intends to pursue an IPO of Mexico Consumer/SBMM, the timing of which will be driven by regulatory approvals and market conditions. Citi will retain its Services , Markets , Banking and Wealth businesses in Mexico.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had 1,317 retail branches, $42 billion in deposits, $16 billion in retail banking loans and $8 billion in outstanding credit card balances, while Mexico SBMM had $6 billion in outstanding corporate loans.

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Description of business segment reporting methodology\n\nResults of the reportable business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that deriv es business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the lev el of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm's LOBs also prov ide v arious business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its inv estors and analysts in assessing performance.\n\n## Revenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and serv ices to the Firm's clients and customers, the participating businesses may agree to share rev enue from those transactions. Rev enue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or serv ice, with allocations to the other segments or businesses inv olv ed in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these rev enue-sharing agreements.\n\n## Expense allocation\n\nWhere business segments use services prov ided by Corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those serv ices are allocated to the respectiv e business segments. The expense is generally allocated based on the actual cost and use of serv ices prov ided. In contrast, certain costs and inv estments related to Corporate that are not currently utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses, and other items not solely aligned with a particular reportable business segment.\n\n## Funds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing ('FTP') is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.\n\n314\n\nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. Effectiv e in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB's net interest income that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm's net interest income.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain rev enues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results.\n\n## Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\n\nAs part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock div idends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock div idends to the business segments is aligned with the relev ant regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment's net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock div idends, to arriv e at a business segment's net income applicable to common equity.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nEach LOB and Corporate is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital lev els of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of an LOB's performance.\n\nThe Firm's current equity allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital depletion in a sev ere stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change.",

      "answer": "MetLife's transparent breakdown of Net Investment Income by segment, including $21,273 million total in 2024, allows analysts to assess investment performance independently from underwriting results. In contrast, AIG's structure combines Net Investment Income with its General Insurance segment results, evaluating performance based on underwriting income.

Our CODMs are the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO). The CODM s evaluate performance of the segments based on underwriting income (loss). The CODMs use this measure to benchmark AIG's performance, assessing performance of the segments and in establishing management's compensation.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, AIG reports the results of its businesses through three segments and Other Operations. The three segments are North A merica Commercial, International Commercial and Global Personal. Other Operations predominantly consists of Net Investment Income from our A IG Parent liquidity portfolio, Corebridge dividend income, corporate General operating expenses, and Interest expense. Prior years' presentations have been recast to conform to the new reportable segments. Our General Insurance business (General Insurance) consists of our three segments and the Net investment income related to our insurance operations.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n53",

      "question": "How does AIG's exposure to equity market volatility affect its Net Amount at Risk, given MetLife's definition of this metric as the excess of Current Death Benefit over account balances at the balance sheet date?",
      "answer": "AIG's Net Amount at Risk is sensitive to equity market volatility because it directly affects the account values underlying variable annuity products. As equity markets fluctuate, the account values of variable annuity separate accounts, which are heavily invested in equity funds, rise or fall. This impacts the fair value of equity-exposed securities and influences the cost of hedging strategies tied to market volatility, such as rebalancing and option costs. MetLife defines Net Amount at Risk as the Current Death Benefit in excess of the current account balance, meaning that if equity market declines reduce account values, the gap between the death benefit and account balance widens, increasing the Net Amount at Risk. Therefore, during periods of equity market volatility, AIG faces both higher hedging costs and potentially higher Net Amount at Risk due to falling account values relative to guaranteed death benefits.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 Current Death Benefit: MetLife defines the Current Death Benefit as the guaranteed amount payable upon death in insurance contracts.",
        "Hop 2: Current Death Benefit \u2192 Net Amount at Risk: The Net Amount at Risk is calculated as the Current Death Benefit minus the current account balance, representing the insurer's liability exposure if all death claims were filed at the balance sheet date.",
        "Hop 3: Net Amount at Risk \u2190 AIG: AIG notes that equity market performance significantly affects the account values of variable annuities and, consequently, the Net Amount at Risk, as lower account values widen the gap between guaranteed benefits and actual balances."

      "answer": "BAC reported that the U.S. unemployment rate remained relatively stable in 2024, contributing to a $1.1 billion increase in net charge-offs, primarily in credit card loans. Goldman Sachs' 2024 data shows a forecast of the U.S. unemployment rate remaining at 4.4% through mid-2025. Citi's 2024 forecasts also align with this outlook, projecting 4.4% for the first two quarters of 2025. This consistent macroeconomic outlook suggests that both BAC and C are operating under similar assumptions regarding unemployment, which directly impacts consumer credit performance and risk provisioning strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and  continues  throughout  a  borrower's  credit  cycle.  Statistical  techniques  in conjunction  with  experiential  judgment  are  used  in  all  aspects  of  portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical experience and  are  a  component  of  our  consumer  credit  risk  management  process.  These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as  well  as  portfolio  management  strategies,  including  authorizations  and  line management,  collection  practices  and  strategies,  and  determination  of  the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.\n\n## Consumer Credit Portfolio\n\nDuring  202 4,  the  U.S.  unemployment  rate  remained  relatively  stable,  and  home prices increased steadily throughout most of 202 4. Net charge-offs increased $1.1 billion to $4.2 billion in 2024 primarily due to higher credit card loan charge-offs.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and lease losses was $8.6 billion, relatively unchanged from 2023. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 72.\n\nFor  more  information  on  our  accounting  policies  regarding  delinquencies, nonperforming  status,  charge-offs  and  loan  modifications  for  the  consumer portfolio, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTable  19  presents  our  outstanding  consumer  loans  and  leases,  consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more.\n\n## Table 19 Consumer Credit Quality\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2024, BAC reported that accruing past due 90 days or more in its U.S. small business commercial portfolio increased by $13 million to $197 million, indicating rising delinquency pressures. Meanwhile, C's USPB segment noted that the 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased year-over-year, driven by macroeconomic pressures such as elevated inflation and interest rates, particularly impacting lower FICO band customers. Both institutions observed increased delinquency trends linked to the delayed maturation of loan vintages due to pandemic-era stimulus. However, USPB specifically attributed 95% of its net credit losses to credit card portfolios, which were also affected by these macroeconomic factors, while BAC noted that credit card-related products represented 99% of its small business net charge-offs. This reveals a parallel in how both banks experienced similar credit risk dynamics in their small business loan segments.",

Retail Banking is concentrated in six  major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also provides mortgages through correspondent channels.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 77% of USPB EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of USPB , as Branded Cards and Retail Services net credit losses represented approximately 95% of total USPB net credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Branded Cards and Retail Services represented 69% and 31%, respectively, of EOP cards loans in USPB .\n\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in USPB was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.\n\nThe 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.\n\nUSPB 's Branded Cards portfolio consists of both proprietary Citi branded cards portfolios (Value, Rewards and Cash) and co-branded cards portfolios (including Costco and American Airlines). Citi's Branded Cards portfolio benefits from a diverse combination of products. Citi's proprietary cards provide customers with a suite of products with rewards, cash rebates and lending solutions, while co-branded cards provide significant affinity benefits through partnerships with large-scale partners across the airline, retail and telecom sectors.\n\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Branded Cards was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter.

      "question": "How do Goldman Sachs' and Charles Schwab's approaches to loan-to-value ratios in securities-based lending compare, and what implications might these approaches have on their respective risk exposures given the specific disclosures in their 2024 filings?",
      "answer": "Goldman Sachs disclosed that, as of December 2024, the vast majority of its securities-based loans had a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than 80%, indicating a conservative risk posture for this segment. In contrast, while Charles Schwab defines LTV as the principal amount of a loan divided by the value of the collateral, it does not specify a threshold or target LTV ratio for its securities-based or margin loans. This lack of a defined LTV ceiling at Schwab could imply a potentially broader risk exposure compared to Goldman Sachs, which actively maintains a sub-80% LTV benchmark. The difference in disclosure depth and policy specificity suggests that Goldman Sachs may have a more structured framework for managing collateral risk in securities-based lending, which could lead to more predictable credit performance during market volatility.",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's 3.7% average yield on non-agency CMBS investments (chunk 1) reflects the return profile of riskier mortgage-backed assets, which are particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment. American Express's data shows the U.S. unemployment rate has fluctuated within a 3%\u20138% range over recent quarters (chunk 2), aligning with broader economic volatility. JPMorgan Chase explicitly incorporates regional U.S. unemployment rates into its credit loss modeling for consumer portfolios and national unemployment for wholesale portfolios (chunk 3). If unemployment remains elevated within this 3%\u20138% band, especially near the higher end, JPM would likely increase its allowance for credit losses due to higher expected defaults, particularly in CMBS-like exposures. The 3.7% yield from MS suggests a risk-adjusted return that may be used to benchmark expected loss rates\u2014lower yields could pressure margins if paired with higher credit losses. Thus, JPM\u2019s modeled credit loss assumptions would need to balance the yield environment with the potential for increased delinquencies under sustained unemployment stress scenarios.",

      "question": "How did the 7% increase in Morgan Stanley's 2023 Compensation and Benefits Expenses compare to the year-over-year change in Charles Schwab's Advisor Services compensation expenses, and what might this imply about their respective talent investment strategies in wealth management?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley reported a 7% increase in Compensation and Benefits Expenses in 2023, reaching $24,558 million, driven by higher deferred cash-based compensation and salary expenses. In contrast, Charles Schwab's Advisor Services segment reported $78 million in Compensation and Benefits Expenses for 2023, though the year-over-year percentage change is not explicitly stated. However, Schwab\u2019s overall Compensation and Benefits Expenses for Investor Services increased by 8% in 2023, suggesting a similar upward trend. The significantly larger absolute investment by Morgan Stanley\u2014over $24 billion\u2014compared to Schwab\u2019s $78 million in Advisor Services implies a more aggressive or resource-intensive talent strategy in wealth management, potentially reflecting differences in scale, service model, or competitive positioning.",

        "Hop 1: MS \u2192 Compensation and Benefits Expenses: Morgan Stanley\u2019s 2023 Compensation and Benefits Expenses rose by 7% to $24,558 million, primarily due to higher deferred compensation and salary expenses.",
        "Hop 2: Compensation and Benefits Expenses \u2192 Advisor Services: Charles Schwab\u2019s 2023 Advisor Services segment reported $78 million in Compensation and Benefits Expenses, while Investor Services saw an 8% increase, indicating a general upward trend in personnel costs.",
        "Hop 3: Advisor Services \u2190 SCHW: Schwab\u2019s detailed financial breakdown shows that the Advisor Services segment spent $78 million on Compensation and Benefits in 2023, which must be analyzed in the context of the broader wealth management segment trends."

      "answer": "American Express reported a cardmember rewards expense of $16.599 billion in 2024, reflecting an 8% increase from 2023. Citi's Branded Cards portfolio, which includes co-branded card relationships like the one with American Airlines, had $117.3 billion in outstanding balances by 4Q24. This significant portfolio size, especially following Citi's announcement of a 10-year extension and expansion of its co-branded credit card partnership with American Airlines and the planned acquisition of the Barclays American Airlines co-branded card portfolio, suggests a growing base of rewards-earning customers that likely contributes to rising rewards expenses across issuers like American Express.",

      "answer": "SCHW's Advisor Services segment experienced revenue growth due to increases in interest-earning assets and fee-based products like asset management and administration fees from proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, despite lower average yields. This indicates a capital-intensive, asset-growth-dependent model. In contrast, MA's revenue is classified into transactional categories such as domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, and transaction processing, which reflect a volume-driven, fee-based model tied to payment activity rather than asset balances.

Both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results in 2021. In addition, net interest revenue increased for Advisor Services due to growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances. The increase in trading revenue for Investor Services was supported by heightened client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020, following the October 6, 2020 TD Ameritrade acquisition.\n\nInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services' growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets.\n\n## Segment Expenses Excluding Interest\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50% and 35%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of TD Ameritrade's results of operations. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, higher bonus accrual, as well as annual merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter (see Item 8 - Note 15).\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services' expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment's client base and greater client base growth from TDA.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSchwab's business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.\n\nOur risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls.

      "question": "How does the change in MetLife's residential portfolio past due loans from 2020 to 2021 compare to Capital One's inclusion of all past due loans in their commercial banking risk ratings framework, particularly in terms of delinquency trends and credit risk management implications?",
      "answer": "MetLife's residential portfolio past due loans decreased from $556 million in 2020 to $450 million in 2021, reflecting a $106 million reduction in delinquencies year-over-year. Meanwhile, Capital One's commercial banking portfolio includes all past due loans\u2014both performing and nonperforming\u2014in their internal risk ratings, as disclosed in their 2022 10-K filing. This comprehensive approach suggests a more integrated credit risk management framework at Capital One, where delinquency data directly informs risk categorization. In contrast, MetLife's data shows an improving trend in delinquencies, but it does not disclose whether such delinquencies are systematically incorporated into a broader risk rating system like Capital One\u2019s. This distinction implies that while MetLife experienced a reduction in delinquent loans, Capital One may have a more proactive mechanism for monitoring and managing credit risk exposure across its commercial portfolio.",

      "answer": "AIG's General Insurance companies reported a statutory capital and surplus of $29,300 million in 2024, while MetLife's MRV segment had a combined statutory capital and surplus of $655 million at the same time. However, MRV's statutory capital and surplus was significantly influenced by a prescribed accounting practice that included $2.0 billion in letters of credit as admitted assets. Without this practice, MRV's capital and surplus would have been much lower, potentially triggering a regulatory event. This indicates that while AIG's statutory capital and surplus is much larger in scale, MRV's reported capital is artificially inflated by specific regulatory allowances.",

        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Statutory Capital and Surplus: AIG's General Insurance companies had a statutory capital and surplus of $29,300 million in 2024.",

The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to M organ Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment, annualized as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment.\n\n## Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal\n\nWe  have  an  ROTCE  goal  of  20%.  Our  ROTCE  goal  is  a  forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors.\n\nSee  'Risk  Factors'  and  'Forward-Looking  Statements'  herein  for  further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results.\n\nROTCE represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see 'Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information' herein.\n\n## Business Segments\n\nSubstantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been  allocated  to  each  business  segment,  generally  in  proportion  to  its respective  net  revenues,  non-interest  ex penses  or  other  relevant  measures. See Note 22 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions.\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\n## Net Revenues\n\n## Investment Banking\n\nInvestment banking revenues are derived from client engagements in which we act as an advisor, underwriter or distributor of capital.\n\nWithin  the  Institutional  Securities  business  segment,  these  revenues  are primarily composed of fees earned from underwriting equity and fixed income securities, syndicating loans and advisory services in relation to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and corporate restructurings.\n\nWithin  the  Wealth  Management  business  segment,  these  revenues  are derived from the distribution of newly issued securities.\n\n## Trading\n\nTrading revenues include the realized gains and losses from transactions in financial  instruments,  unrealized  gains  and  losses  from  ongoing  changes  in the fair value of our positions, and gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to DCP.\n\nWithin the Institutional Securities business segment, Trading revenues arise from transactions in cash instruments and derivatives in which we act as a market  maker  for  our  clients.  In  this  role,  we  stand  ready  to  buy,  sell  or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide  firm  or  indicative  prices  in  response  to  customer  requests.  Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to:\n\n- taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell and-depending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the position-to hold those positions for a period of time;\n- building,  maintaining  and  rebalancing  inventory  held  to  facilitate  client activity through trades with other market participants;\n- managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between risks incurred  from  the  facilitation  of  client  transactions  and  the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks;\n- trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and\n- engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets.\n\nIn many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from purchase and  sale  transactions  will  include  any  spreads  between  bids  and  offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value.",

      "question": "How do the transaction-based expense structures in Goldman Sachs' Global Banking & Markets segment compare to Bank of America's physical property footprint costs in the same segment, and what might this imply about their respective cost scalability in volatile market conditions?",
      "answer": "Goldman Sachs' Global Banking & Markets segment reports that its other operating expenses 'primarily included transaction based, communications and technology, and depreciation and amortization expenses,' indicating a significant portion of variable costs tied to transaction volume. In contrast, Bank of America's Global Banking & Markets segment occupies 2,024,684 square feet at Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park (New York, NY), a leased property, and 510,170 square feet at Bank of America Financial Centre in London, UK, also leased. These large leased properties represent substantial fixed costs. The difference suggests that Goldman Sachs may have more variable cost structures tied to transaction volumes, potentially offering better scalability during volatile market conditions, while Bank of America carries higher fixed costs from its physical footprint that may pressure margins if transaction volumes decline.",

      "question": "How might Capital One's credit card portfolio delinquency trends be impacted if Citigroup's 3Q24 unemployment rate forecast of 4.4% becomes the new baseline, considering Capital One's sensitivity to U.S. unemployment fluctuations?",
      "answer": "Capital One's credit card portfolio shows a strong correlation with the U.S. unemployment rate, where increases in unemployment could materially affect credit performance and delinquency trends. Citigroup's forecast of 4.4% for the U.S. unemployment rate in 3Q24 suggests a potential deterioration in employment conditions. Given that Capital One monitors delinquency trends closely under such macroeconomic pressures, a sustained unemployment rate at this level could lead to higher delinquency rates and increased credit risk in their credit card segment.",

        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 U.S. Unemployment Rate: Capital One explicitly links its credit card portfolio performance to macroeconomic indicators like the U.S. unemployment rate, noting that increases in unemployment can materially affect credit performance and delinquency trends.",
        "Hop 2: U.S. Unemployment Rate \u2192 4.4%: JPMorgan's evidence shows that the U.S. unemployment rate was reported at 4.4% in 4Q24 under 2023's forecast assumptions, indicating a recent rise in unemployment that may reflect current economic conditions.",
        "Hop 3: 4.4% \u2190 C: Citigroup's forecast specifically shows a 4.4% unemployment rate for 3Q24, suggesting that this level of unemployment is not a one-time anomaly but part of a broader economic outlook, which could influence Capital One's credit risk exposure if sustained."

We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. Real G ross Domestic Product ('GDP') growth rate, as well as consumers' financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card loan portfolio is delinquency trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time.\n\nThe table below presents our credit card portfolio by delinquency status as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Table 4.3: Credit Card Delinquency Status\n\n",

      "answer": "COF's small business loans are described as geographically diversified across the United States due to its product and marketing approach. In contrast, C's USPB segment focuses its retail banking activities, including small business loans, in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. Within C's USPB portfolio, small business loans are part of a broader retail banking network where 77% of end-of-period loans consisted of credit card products as of December 31, 2024, which significantly influences overall credit performance. This suggests that COF's geographic diversification may insulate it somewhat from regional credit shocks, while C's concentration in major urban centers, combined with its high exposure to credit card lending, may expose it to different macroeconomic pressures, particularly in lower FICO band segments.",

Retail Banking is concentrated in six  major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also provides mortgages through correspondent channels.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 77% of USPB EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of USPB , as Branded Cards and Retail Services net credit losses represented approximately 95% of total USPB net credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Branded Cards and Retail Services represented 69% and 31%, respectively, of EOP cards loans in USPB .\n\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in USPB was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.\n\nThe 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.\n\nUSPB 's Branded Cards portfolio consists of both proprietary Citi branded cards portfolios (Value, Rewards and Cash) and co-branded cards portfolios (including Costco and American Airlines). Citi's Branded Cards portfolio benefits from a diverse combination of products. Citi's proprietary cards provide customers with a suite of products with rewards, cash rebates and lending solutions, while co-branded cards provide significant affinity benefits through partnerships with large-scale partners across the airline, retail and telecom sectors.\n\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Branded Cards was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter.

      "question": "How do Morgan Stanley's over-collateralization practices for securities-based loans compare to Charles Schwab's loan-to-value management, given the industry standard of less than 80% LTV for performing loans?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley discloses that its securities-based loans are predominantly over-collateralized as of December 31, 2024, and 2023. According to industry data from Goldman Sachs' filings, the vast majority of such securities-based loans across the industry have a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than 80% and are performing in accordance with contractual terms. Meanwhile, Charles Schwab defines LTV as the principal amount of a loan divided by the value of the collateral securing the loan, which aligns with this industry standard. Therefore, while Morgan Stanley achieves risk mitigation through over-collateralization, Schwab's approach appears to focus on adherence to the widely accepted LTV threshold of 80%, suggesting different risk management strategies for similar lending practices in the wealth management sector.",

Meanwhile, COF's 'Other Loans' generated $356 million in interest income in 2021, all attributed to rate changes since volume had no impact. AXP's data from 2020 shows that for 'Other Loans,' just 9,000 accounts held $345 million in balances, with a 3 percentage point interest rate reduction and 16 months of average payment term extensions, suggesting elevated credit risk and borrower distress.

      "answer": "Charles Schwab's Total Trading Revenue increased by 1% in 2024, reaching $3,264 million, primarily due to a 5% growth in order flow revenue, which rose to $1,477 million. This modest growth reflects a mixed performance across trading segments, with options order flow up 6% and equities up 3%. In contrast, Capital One disclosed Level 3 fair value measurements for its retained interests in securitizations at $34 million, with sensitivity to unobservable inputs such as life of receivables (31\u201381 months), prepayment rates (7\u20139%), and default rates (1%). These Level 3 assets indicate Capital One's exposure to credit and market volatility, unlike Schwab's market-driven trading revenue sensitivity.

      "answer": "MetLife recognizes net investment income from alternative investments like real estate joint ventures using either the equity method or fair value option, with $3,304 million in net investment income contributing to its general insurance segment profitability in 2021. In contrast, AIG manages investment portfolio results at the corporate level rather than within its general insurance operations, with $3,304 million in net investment income shown separately from general insurance operating metrics in 2021, indicating different approaches to integrating investment returns with insurance segment performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n\n## 1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\nAlso included in mortgage loans are residential mortgage loans for which the FVO was elected, and which are stated at estimated fair value. Changes in estimated fair value are recognized in net investment income.\n\nMortgage loans that are designated as held-for-sale, are carried at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value.\n\n## Policy Loans\n\nPolicy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances. Interest income is recognized as earned using the contractual interest rate.  Generally,  accrued  interest  is  capitalized  on  the  policy's  anniversary  date. Valuation  allowances  are  not  established  for policy  loans,  as  they  are  fully  collateralized  by  the  cash  surrender  value  of  the  underlying  insurance  policies. Any  unpaid principal  and  accrued  interest  are  deducted  from  the  cash  surrender  value  or  the  death  benefit  prior  to  settlement  of  the insurance policy.\n\n## Real Estate\n\nReal estate is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis, without any provision for salvage value, over the estimated useful life of the asset (typically up to 55 years). Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases. The Company periodically reviews its real estate for impairment and tests  for  recoverability  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  value  may  not  be  recoverable. Properties whose carrying values are greater than their estimated undiscounted cash flows are written down to their estimated fair  value,  which  is  generally  computed  using  the  present  value  of  expected  future  cash  flows  discounted  at  a  rate commensurate with the underlying risks.\n\nReal estate for which the Company commits to a plan to sell within one year and actively markets in its current condition for a reasonable price in comparison to its estimated fair value is classified as held-for-sale and is not depreciated. Real estate held-for-sale is stated at the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition costs.\n\n## Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership Interests\n\nThe Company uses the equity method of accounting or the FVO for real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests  ('investee')  when  it  has  more  than  a  minor  ownership  interest  or  more  than  a  minor  influence  over  the  investee's operations  but  does  not  hold  a  controlling  financial  interest,  including  when  the  Company  is  not  deemed  the  primary beneficiary of a VIE. Under the equity method, the Company recognizes in earnings within net investment income its share of the investee's earnings. Contributions paid by the Company increase carrying value and distributions received by the Company reduce carrying value. The Company generally recognizes its share of the investee's earnings on a three-month lag in instances where the investee's financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee's reporting period differs from the Company's reporting period.\n\nThe Company accounts for its interest in real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests in which it has virtually no influence over the investee's operations at estimated fair value. Unrealized gains (losses), representing changes in estimated fair value of these investments, are recognized in earnings within net investment gains (losses). Due to the nature and structure  of  these  investments,  they  do  not  meet  the  characteristics  of  an  equity  security  in  accordance  with  applicable accounting guidance.\n\nThe Company consolidates real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests of which it holds a controlling financial  interest,  or  it  is  deemed  the  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE.  Assets  of  certain  of  these  consolidated  other  limited partnership interests and real estate joint ventures are recorded at estimated fair value. Unrealized gains (losses) representing changes in estimated fair value are recognized in net investment income.\n\nThe Company routinely evaluates its equity method investments for impairment. When it is determined an equity method investment has had a loss in value that is other than temporary, it is impaired. Such an impairment is charged to net investment gains (losses).\n\n## Short-term Investments\n\nShort-term investments include highly liquid securities and other investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but greater than three months, at the time of purchase. Securities included within short-term investments are stated at estimated fair  value,  while  other  investments  included  within  short-term  investments  are  stated  at  amortized  cost  less  ACL,  which approximates estimated fair value.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan reports a total of $170.16 billion in commercial real estate loans as part of its wholesale loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024. Morgan Stanley\u2019s U.S. Bank Subsidiaries engage in real estate lending, including secured lending facilities and commercial/residential real estate loans, which contribute to their adjusted average assets. These assets are critical in calculating the Tier 1 leverage ratio, where regulatory capital requirements under the OCC mandate that U.S. Bank Subsidiaries remain well-capitalized. Given JPMorgan's significant CRE exposure, if subjected to the OCC\u2019s PCA standards like Morgan Stanley\u2019s subsidiaries, it could face heightened capital adequacy pressures similar to those affecting MSBNA and MSPBNA, which phased in CECL adoption impacts on capital ratios starting in 2022.",

Adjusted  average  assets  represents  the  denominator  of  the  T ier  1  leverage  ratio  and  is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallow ed goodw ill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in our ow n capital instruments, certain deferred tax assets and other capital deductions.\n\n3. Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented.\n\n2. Supplementary  leverage  exposure  is  the  sum  of  Adjusted  average  assets  used  in  the  T ier  1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.\n\n## U.S. Bank Subsidiaries' Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios\n\nThe OCC establishes capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the Firm's regulatory capital requirements, although G -SIB capital surcharge and SCB requirements do not apply to the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.\n\nThe  OCC's regulatory  capital  framework  includes  Prompt  Corrective Action ('PCA') standards, including 'well-capitalized' PCA standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. For the Firm to remain an FHC, its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the OCC's PCA standards. In addition, failure by the  U.S.  Bank  Subsidiaries to meet  minimum  capital  requirements  may  result  in  certain  mandatory  and discretionary  actions  by  regulators  that,  if  undertaken,  could  have  a  direct material  effect  on  the  U.S.  Bank  Subsidiaries'  and  the  Firm's  financial statements.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, MSBNA and MSPBNA riskbased capital ratios are based on the Standardized Approach rules. Beginning on January 1, 2020, MSBNA and MSPBNA elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on risk-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted  average  assets  and  supplementary  leverage  exposure  calculations, over a five-year transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from January 1, 2022 and were phased-in at 75% from January 1, 2024. The deferral impacts were fully phased-in from January 1, 2025.\n\n## MSBNA's Regulatory Capital\n\n",

      "answer": "MetLife's RIS - Annuities segment balance declined from $21,895 million in 2021 to $11,659 million in 2023, a decrease of $10,236 million, largely driven by surrenders and withdrawals totaling $9,440 million in 2023 alone. Over the same period, AIG experienced significant surrenders and withdrawals in its annuity business, with totals of $15,037 million in 2021, $15,042 million in 2022, and $23,406 million in 2023, indicating increasing pressure on policyholder retention. The sharper decline in AIG's surrenders and withdrawals in 2023, compared to MetLife's more gradual reduction, suggests that AIG's annuity business may have faced more pronounced liquidity or customer retention challenges during this period.",

      "answer": "For Capital One (COF), a +50 basis point increase in interest rates is estimated to increase projected baseline net interest income by 1.5% as of December 31, 2021. In contrast, for American Express (AXP), a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could decrease annual net interest income by up to $206 million, indicating a negative sensitivity. Therefore, while COF benefits from moderate interest rate increases, AXP faces potential margin compression under similar conditions.",

        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 +50 Basis Points: Capital One estimates that a +50 basis point increase would raise projected baseline net interest income by 1.5% as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Hop 2: +50 Basis Points \u2192 Net Interest Income: Interest rate increases generally affect financial institutions' net interest income based on the spread between interest earned on loans and interest paid on deposits and borrowings.",
        "Hop 3: Net Interest Income \u2190 AXP: American Express estimates that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could reduce annual net interest income by up to $206 million, showing a negative sensitivity due to higher interest expense outpacing interest income growth."

If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease. As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on our annual net interest income of up to $206 million. A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change if benchmark interest rates change. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see 'Risk Management - Market Risk Management Process' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## The discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements.\n\nCertain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements will need to be amended or otherwise modified to replace references to the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) with an alternative reference rate, as the LIBOR tenors referenced are expected to be quoted only through June 2023. Alternative reference rates, such as the secured overnight financing rate, are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate differently than, and not be representative of, LIBOR. In order to compensate for these differences, certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment. However, there is no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR, either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements.\n\nUncertainty as to the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference rates and the discontinuance of LIBOR generally may negatively impact market liquidity, our access to funding and the trading market for our financial instruments. Furthermore, the timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could be subject to disputes, could cause the interest payable on our outstanding financial instruments and commercial agreements to be materially different than expected and may impact the value of such instruments and agreements.\n\n## Adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\n\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. Additional factors affecting the extent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## Any reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRatings of our long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, and the macroeconomic environment. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends, in part, on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts. If we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of our asset-backed securities, it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets.\n\n## Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital.\n\nDuring 2021, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them. Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign",

Most of our Investment Management business and Pershing businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY.\n\nEach of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.\n\nBNY's banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Federal Reserve').

      "answer": "A sustained U.S. unemployment rate of 3.7% in 2024 could lead to higher credit losses for COF, as their allowance for credit losses assumes a rise in unemployment to 4.4% by Q4 2024. If the rate remains lower than expected, delinquencies and charge-offs may be less severe than modeled, potentially reducing the need for large provisions. However, this would occur in a low-yield environment for MS, as seen in their 3.7% annualized average yield on non-agency CMBS holdings with maturities over 5 years, which could pressure investment returns and offset some of the benefits from lower credit losses.",

      "answer": "BAC reported a noninterest expense of $1,580 million in 2024. JPM, on the other hand, guides investors using 'adjusted expense,' which excludes firmwide legal expenses from its noninterest expense to provide an alternative view of performance. Without the specific amount of JPM\u2019s noninterest expense or the value of its firmwide legal expenses, we cannot directly quantify JPM\u2019s adjusted expense figure, but we understand that the adjustment is intended to remove the volatility caused by legal costs, which BAC does not appear to exclude in its reporting of noninterest expense.",

      "answer": "JPM's Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) segment addresses credit spread risk through its inclusion in other sensitivity-based measures, specifically referencing initial seed capital investments and co-investments alongside third-party investors in privately distributed collective vehicles. These exposures are sensitive to market factors like credit spreads and are managed through derivatives hedging strategies. In contrast, AIG explicitly incorporates credit risk into its fair value measurements for liabilities by referencing observable credit default swaps (CDS) or cash bond spreads, using discounted cash flow techniques that account for current market interest rates and credit spread changes. While JPM focuses on hedging through derivatives and sensitivity-based risk measures, AIG adjusts liability valuations directly based on credit spread dynamics, reflecting a more valuation-centric approach.",

          "chunk_text": "## 5. Fair Value Measurements\n\n## FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS\n\nWe carry certain of our financial instruments at fair value. We define the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We are responsible for the determination of the value of the investments carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions.\n\nThe degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally inversely correlates with the level of observable valuation inputs. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments for which no quoted prices are available have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, liquidity  and general market conditions.\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are measured and classified in accordance with a fair value hierarchy consisting of three 'levels' based on the observability of valuation inputs:\n\n- Level 1: Fair v alue measurements based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that we have the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. M arket price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer markets. We do not adjust the quoted price for such instruments.\n- Level 2: Fair v alue measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n- Level 3: Fair v alue measurements based on valuation techniques that use significant inputs that are unobservable. Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair values of positions classified in Level 3. The circumstances for using these measurements include those in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability . Therefore, we must make certain assumptions about the inputs a hypothetical market participant would use to value that asset or liability .\n\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments carried at fair value. These methodologies are applied to assets and liabilities across the levels discussed above, and the observability of the inputs used determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for the respective asset or liability.\n\n## VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE\n\n## Incorporation of Credit Risk in Fair Value Measurements\n\n- Our Own Credit Risk. Fair v alue measurements for certain liabilities incorporate our own credit risk by determining the explicit cost for each counterparty to protect against its net credit exposure to us at the balance sheet date by reference to observable A IG credit default swaps (CDS) or cash bond spreads. We calculate the effect of credit spread changes using discounted cash flow techniques that incorporate current market interest rates. A  derivative counterparty's net credit exposure to us is determined based on master netting agreements, when applicable, which take into consideration all derivative positions with us, as well as collateral we post with the counterparty at the balance sheet date.\n- Counterparty Credit Risk. Fair v alue measurements for freestanding derivatives incorporate counterparty credit by determining the explicit cost for us to protect against our net credit exposure to each counterparty at the balance sheet date by reference to observable counterparty CDS spreads, when available. When not available, other directly  or indirectly  observ able credit spreads will be used to deriv e the best estimates of the counterparty spreads. Our net credit exposure to a counterparty is determined based on master netting agreements, which take into consideration all derivative positions with the counterparty, as well as collateral posted by the counterparty at the balance sheet date.\n\n110\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. Real G ross Domestic Product ('GDP') growth rate, as well as consumers' financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card loan portfolio is delinquency trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time.\n\nThe table below presents our credit card portfolio by delinquency status as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Table 4.3: Credit Card Delinquency Status\n\n",

Meanwhile, Capital One reported total deposits of $310,980 million in 2021 and $305,442 million in 2020, showing a much smaller increase of $5,538 million.

Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented.\n\n2. Supplementary  leverage  exposure  is  the  sum  of  Adjusted  average  assets  used  in  the  T ier  1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.\n\n## U.S. Bank Subsidiaries' Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios\n\nThe OCC establishes capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the Firm's regulatory capital requirements, although G -SIB capital surcharge and SCB requirements do not apply to the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.\n\nThe  OCC's regulatory  capital  framework  includes  Prompt  Corrective Action ('PCA') standards, including 'well-capitalized' PCA standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. For the Firm to remain an FHC, its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the OCC's PCA standards. In addition, failure by the  U.S.  Bank  Subsidiaries to meet  minimum  capital  requirements  may  result  in  certain  mandatory  and discretionary  actions  by  regulators  that,  if  undertaken,  could  have  a  direct material  effect  on  the  U.S.  Bank  Subsidiaries'  and  the  Firm's  financial statements.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, MSBNA and MSPBNA riskbased capital ratios are based on the Standardized Approach rules. Beginning on January 1, 2020, MSBNA and MSPBNA elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on risk-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted  average  assets  and  supplementary  leverage  exposure  calculations, over a five-year transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from January 1, 2022 and were phased-in at 75% from January 1, 2024. The deferral impacts were fully phased-in from January 1, 2025.\n\n## MSBNA's Regulatory Capital\n\n",

      "answer": "The projected increase in the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield from 1.97% in 2022 to 2.52% by 2024 suggests a rising interest rate environment, which could pressure COF to reassess their 3% weighted average yield assumption used in valuing RMBS and retained interests.

      "answer": "AIG's DPAC for the Life and Retirement segment increased from $7,316 million in 2020 to $8,086 million in 2021, reflecting a growth of $770 million. This increase indicates a rising investment in acquiring new policies and associated long-term liabilities. MET also discloses DPAC as a key accounting policy, specifically noting its treatment under Note 5, which includes Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Value of Business Acquired, and other intangibles. The fact that MET explicitly highlights DPAC in its accounting policies suggests a similarly significant role in its financial strategy. The combination of AIG's rising DPAC and MET's policy emphasis on DPAC implies that both companies are managing substantial long-term insurance liabilities, but AIG's recent increase may signal a more aggressive growth phase in its Life and Retirement business relative to MET's more policy-structured approach.",

      "question": "How does Capital One's credit card profitability, as measured by its income from continuing operations, net of tax, compare with JPMorgan's credit card exposure in terms of scale and business model implications?",
      "answer": "Capital One's Credit Card segment contributed $7,758 million to its income from continuing operations, net of tax, in 2021, indicating a significant profitability driver within its consolidated total of $12,394 million. This highlights a business model where the credit card segment plays a dominant role in overall profitability. In contrast, JPMorgan's credit card portfolio, with a contractual amount of $915,658 million in 2023, reflects a much larger exposure in terms of scale. However, JPMorgan does not explicitly disclose the profitability of its credit card segment in these filings. Therefore, while JPMorgan holds a substantially larger credit card portfolio, Capital One derives a clearly defined and substantial portion of its net income from this segment, suggesting differing risk-return profiles and strategic weightings within each institution's broader business model.",

        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax: Capital One's 2021 Credit Card segment contributed $7,758 million to its income from continuing operations, net of tax, out of a consolidated total of $12,394 million, indicating a dominant profitability contribution.",
        "Hop 2: Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax \u2192 Credit Card: The Credit Card segment at Capital One is a major contributor to net income, with $7,758 million in 2021, significantly higher than other segments like Consumer Banking ($3,676 million) and Commercial Banking ($1,532 million).",
        "Hop 3: Credit Card \u2190 JPM: JPMorgan disclosed a credit card portfolio with a contractual amount of $915,658 million in 2023, significantly larger in scale than Capital One\u2019s, but does not specify the profitability or net income contribution of this segment in the provided evidence."

      "question": "How does the distribution of MS's 'Loans, net of ACL' in the 1-5 years maturity bucket compare to BAC's exposure to credit default protection for the same maturity period, and what might this imply about their respective risk profiles?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley (MS) reported $2,564 million in 'Loans, net of ACL' for the 1-5 years maturity bucket as of December 31, 2023. Bank of America (BAC) reported that 64% of its net credit default protection was allocated to the 'greater than one year and less than or equal to five years' maturity segment. This suggests that both firms have significant exposure in the 1-5 year maturity range, but BAC's higher reliance on credit default protection in this segment may indicate a more hedged but potentially more complex risk profile compared to MS, which holds a direct loan exposure of $2,564 million in the same maturity range.",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley\u2019s U.S. Bank Subsidiaries (MSBNA and MSPBNA) have deferred the impact of CECL on risk-based capital calculations, with 50% of the deferral impacts phased in as of January 1, 2023, which affects their capital treatment for loans including Commercial Real Estate Loans. These subsidiaries actively provide Commercial Real Estate Loans as part of their Institutional Securities lending activities. In contrast, JPMorgan\u2019s retained securitization interests in commercial real estate loans included $6.1 billion of investment-grade and $1.7 billion of noninvestment-grade retained interests as of December 31, 2023, with 77% of total retained interests rated 'A' or better.

      "answer": "AXP reported an average payment term extension of 16 months for Other Loans under troubled debt restructurings in 2021, while COF recorded $356 million in interest income from Other Loans during the same period. This suggests that despite extended payment terms, which may signal financial stress among borrowers, COF was able to maintain positive interest income from this segment, potentially indicating stronger loan performance or different risk management strategies compared to AXP.",

      "question": "How does the $53.0 billion decrease in average deposits at GWIM compare to the 11% decline in average deposits at COF, and what might this indicate about the relative pressure on deposit balances across wealth management and consumer finance businesses?",
      "answer": "GWIM reported a $53.0 billion decrease in average deposits in 2023, driven by clients shifting funds to higher-yielding investment alternatives. COF also experienced a significant decline, with an 11% drop in average deposits year-over-year. The parallel declines suggest that both wealth management (GWIM) and consumer finance (COF) businesses faced similar pressures in retaining deposits amid rising opportunities in higher-yielding investment and cash alternatives.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 GWIM: BAC's GWIM segment reported a $53.0 billion decrease in average deposits in 2023, attributed to clients moving funds to higher-yielding investment cash alternatives.",
        "Hop 2: GWIM \u2192 Average Deposits: The decrease in GWIM\u2019s average deposits reflects a shift in client behavior toward higher-yielding investment products, particularly on brokerage and investment platforms.",
        "Hop 3: Average Deposits \u2190 COF: COF also experienced an 11% year-over-year decline in average deposits, indicating a broader trend of deposit outflows across different financial services segments."

      "answer": "JPM reported that its AWM segment experienced growth in balances in new and existing client accounts due to higher-yielding product offerings, but this was largely offset by continued migration into other investments. GS, on the other hand, reported a 11% increase in investment management revenues, primarily driven by higher average assets under supervision (AUS), indicating stronger retention or attraction of client funds in AWM despite market pressures. This suggests that while both firms face client migration pressures, GS's AWM segment was more resilient or effective in managing client flows and capitalizing on market opportunities in 2024.",

AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n- Market making consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from client execution activities related to making markets in interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies, commodities and equity products. These activities are included in Global Banking &amp; Markets.\n- Other principal transactions consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from  our  equity  investing  activities,  including  revenues  related  to  our consolidated  investments  (included  in  Asset  &amp;  Wealth  Management), and  debt  investing  and  lending  activities  (included  across  our  three segments).\n\nOperating  Environment. During  2024,  the  operating  environment  was generally  characterized  by  continued  broad  macroeconomic  concerns, including  concerns  and  uncertainty  about  inflation,  ongoing  geopolitical tensions, central bank  policy and the potential outcome  of  national elections.  In  investment  banking,  industry-wide  underwriting  volumes increased compared with 2023, driven by strong levels of debt offerings and  improved  levels  of  equity  offerings,  while  industry-wide  completed mergers and acquisitions volumes remained below historical averages.  In market  making,  activity  levels  were  mixed,  as  activity  levels  in  fixed income-related  products  decreased  compared  with  the  prior  year,  while activity  levels  in  equity-related  products  increased.  Global  equity  prices were generally higher compared with the end of 2023, and concerns about the  commercial  real  estate  market  persisted.  In  the  U.S.,  the  rate  of unemployment  remained  low  and  the  pace  of  growth  in  consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2023.\n\nIf  uncertainty and concerns about geopolitical tensions and the economic outlook  remain  elevated  or  grow,  including  those  about  central  bank policy,  inflation  and  the  commercial  real  estate  sector,  it  may  lead  to  a decline in asset prices, a decline in market-making activity levels, a decline in  industry-wide  investment  banking  volumes,  and  net  revenues  and provision  for  credit  losses  would  likely  be  negatively  impacted.  See 'Segment Assets  and  Operating  Results  -  Segment  Operating  Results' for  information  about  the  operating  environment  and  material  trends  and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.\n\n## 2024 versus 2023\n\nNet  revenues  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  were  $53.51 billion  for  2024,  16%  higher  than  2023,  primarily  reflecting  significantly higher  other  principal  transactions  revenues,  net  interest  income  and investment banking revenues and higher investment management revenues.\n\nNon-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated  statements  of  earnings  were  $7.74  billion  for  2024,  24% higher than 2023, primarily reflecting significantly higher revenues in debt underwriting, primarily driven by leveraged finance activity, and in equity underwriting, primarily driven by secondary and initial public offerings. In addition,  revenues  in  advisory  were  higher,  reflecting  an  increase  in completed mergers and acquisitions transactions.\n\nInvestment management  revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings  were  $10.60  billion  for  2024,  11%  higher  than  2023,  primarily due to higher management and other fees, primarily reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision (AUS).\n\nCommissions  and  fees  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  were $4.09 billion  for  2024,  8%  higher  than  2023,  due  to  higher  commissions and  fees  in  Equities,  reflecting  generally  higher  market  volumes  and increased transaction fees, partially offset by a loss related to the planned transition of the GM credit card program to another issuer.\n\nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $18.39  billion  for  2024,  essentially  unchanged  compared  with  2023. Market  making  revenues  from  intermediation activities were  slightly higher,  primarily  reflecting  significantly  higher  revenues  in  equity  cash products, currencies and mortgages, offset by significantly lower revenues in commodities and equity derivatives. Market making revenues from financing activities were essentially unchanged, reflecting significantly  lower  revenues  in  FICC  financing,  offset  by  significantly higher revenues from Equities financing.\n\nOther  principal  transactions  revenues  in  the  consolidated  statements  of earnings  were  $4.65  billion  for  2024,  119%  higher  than  2023,  primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from  investments in private equities,  significantly  higher  net  gains  from  derivatives  related  to  our funding  activities,  the  impact  of  the  sale  of  the  Marcus  loan  portfolio  in 2023 (including net revenues of approximately $(370) million related to the sale of substantially all of the portfolio) and significantly lower net losses on hedges related to our relationship lending portfolio.",

      "question": "How does the 4% increase in Morgan Stanley's non-interest expenses, driven by higher compensation tied to carried interest, compare with Goldman Sachs' $9,426 million compensation expenses in their Global Banking & Markets segment, and what does this reveal about their respective cost management strategies in capital markets?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's non-interest expenses increased by 4% in 2024, primarily due to higher compensation associated with carried interest, indicating a direct link between performance-based income and rising costs. Goldman Sachs' Global Banking & Markets segment reported $9,426 million in compensation and benefits expenses in 2024, which is a significant portion of their $19,980 million total operating expenses. This suggests that both firms face similar pressures in managing compensation costs tied to performance metrics, though Morgan Stanley's increase highlights a more recent upward trend in variable pay linked to carried interest accruals, particularly in infrastructure and real estate funds.",

      "answer": "Citigroup's forecast for the U.S. unemployment rate remains at 4.4% for Q1 2025 and Q3 2024, indicating a relatively stable outlook. Goldman Sachs also forecasts the unemployment rate to remain at 4.4% through mid-2025 before slightly declining to 4.3% in mid-2026. However, Goldman Sachs explicitly ties its allowance for credit losses\u2014$4.7 billion as of December 31, 2024\u2014to forecasted macroeconomic indicators like the U.S. unemployment rate and GDP growth. This suggests that Goldman Sachs has a more direct financial exposure tied to the accuracy of its 4.4% unemployment forecast, particularly for its wholesale loan portfolio, compared to Citigroup, which references the rate in broader forecasting without explicit linkage to credit loss modeling.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: Citigroup (C) \u2192 4.4% (FIN_METRIC): Citigroup forecasts the U.S. unemployment rate to be 4.4% in Q3 2024 and Q1 2025, showing a consistent macroeconomic outlook.",

The  allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is  measured  using  a  modeled  approach.  These  models  determine  the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including  internal  credit  ratings,  industry  default  and  loss  data,  expected life  and  macroeconomic  indicators  (the  most  significant  to  the  forecast model  being  the  forecasted  U.S.  unemployment  and  U.S.  GDP  growth rates),  the  borrower's  capacity  to  meet  its  financial  obligations,  the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The  allowance  for  credit  losses  also  includes  qualitative  components which  allow  management  to  reflect  the  uncertain  nature  of  economic forecasting,  capture  uncertainty  regarding  model  inputs,  and  account  for model imprecision and concentration risk.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures  relating  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the  wholesale loan  portfolio  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  (i)  the  significant  judgment  by management  when  developing  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the wholesale  loan  portfolio  using  a  modeled  approach,  (ii)  a  high  degree  of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence  related  to  management's  internal  credit  ratings,  forecasted  U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n130\n\nGoldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nAddressing  the  matter  involved  performing  procedures  and  evaluating audit  evidence  in  connection  with  forming  our  overall  opinion  on  the consolidated  financial  statements.  These  procedures  included  testing  the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, including controls over the determination of management's internal credit ratings, forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting. These procedures also included, among  others, (i) testing management's  process for developing the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using  a  modeled  approach  (ii)  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of data  used  in  the  estimate,  and  (iii)  the  involvement  of  professionals  with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of the forecast model and methodology used by management  (b)  the  reasonableness of management's  internal credit ratings,  forecasted  U.S.  unemployment  and  U.S.  GDP  growth  rates,  and (c) the reasonableness of the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nNew York, New York February 26, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1922.",

      "answer": "JPM forecasts the U.S. unemployment rate to be 4.4% for 4Q24, based on their central case assumptions. This matches the 4.4% forecast for the same period as guided by C. However, C\u2019s internal forecast at 3Q24 shows an expectation of 4.4% for both 1Q25 and 3Q25, indicating a view that unemployment will remain stable at that level into the following year. This alignment at 4.4% suggests both firms see similar labor market conditions in the near term, though C\u2019s extended flat forecast implies a slightly more cautious outlook on labor market normalization compared to JPM\u2019s gradual decline to 4.3% by 2Q25.",

      "question": "How does the reliance on service charge revenue in BAC's Consumer Banking segment compare to COF's use of similar fees, given COF's reported Consumer Banking net income of $1.5 billion in 2024?",
      "answer": "BAC reported $2,445 million in service charge revenue from its Consumer Banking business in 2024, which is a key component of its noninterest income. COF also relies on service charges and other customer-related fees as a primary source of revenue for its Consumer Banking business, which generated $1.5 billion in net income during the same period. This indicates that while both firms depend on service charges, BAC's fee revenue is significantly higher relative to COF's net income, suggesting differing strategies or operational structures in how each firm monetizes its consumer banking services.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 Service Charges: BAC reported $2,445 million in service charge revenue from its Consumer Banking segment in 2024, showing the significance of these fees to its overall revenue model.",

        "Hop 3: Consumer Banking Business \u2190 COF: COF reported $1.5 billion in net income from its Consumer Banking business in 2024, underscoring the profitability of this segment despite its reliance on similar fee structures."

Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Consumer Banking business are primarily related to fees earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services such as automated teller machine ('ATM') usage. Service charges and other customer-related fees within our Commercial Banking business are mostly related to fees earned on treasury management and capital markets services. Other contract revenue in our Credit Card business consists primarily of revenue from our partnership arrangements. Other contract revenue in our Consumer Banking business consists primarily of revenue earned from services provided to auto industry participants. Revenue from contracts with customers is included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe following table presents revenue from contracts with customers and a reconciliation to non-interest income by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Table 18.2: Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Reconciliation to Segment Results\n\n",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley reported $3,564 million in lending commitments maturing within one year as of December 31, 2023, while Goldman Sachs had $38,967 million in repurchase agreements and $12,068 million in securities loaned within the '91 days-1 year' maturity range as of December 2024. This suggests that Goldman Sachs has a significantly larger short-term exposure through repurchase agreements compared to Morgan Stanley's lending commitments, potentially indicating different liquidity risk management strategies between the two firms.",

      "answer": "American Express reported 4,000 accounts for 'Other Loans' in 2021, with a total balance of $13 million and an average payment term extension of 16 months. In contrast, PayPal disclosed only 3,000 accounts for loans in 2021 with a significantly higher outstanding balance of $45 million and a slightly lower average payment term extension of 36 months. This suggests that while PayPal has a higher concentration of loan balances per account with longer payment extensions, American Express has a slightly larger number of accounts with lower balances and moderately shorter term extensions, indicating different risk profiles in their loan portfolios.",

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs incorporates the U.S. unemployment rate as a key macroeconomic input in its credit loss forecasting model for wholesale loans, specifically using forecasted values to estimate probabilities of default and loss severities. According to its 2024 10-K, the modeled approach includes forecasted U.S. unemployment and GDP growth rates as the most significant external factors. The 4.4% unemployment figure appears in industry projections as a central case assumption, aligning with Citigroup\u2019s explicit guidance in its own 2024 filings, where it forecasts a quarterly average of 4.4% for the U.S. unemployment rate in 3Q24. This reveals that both GS and C are closely tracking the same unemployment threshold in their economic forecasting and risk modeling, despite differing in how they disclose or apply it operationally.",

The  allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is  measured  using  a  modeled  approach.  These  models  determine  the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including  internal  credit  ratings,  industry  default  and  loss  data,  expected life  and  macroeconomic  indicators  (the  most  significant  to  the  forecast model  being  the  forecasted  U.S.  unemployment  and  U.S.  GDP  growth rates),  the  borrower's  capacity  to  meet  its  financial  obligations,  the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The  allowance  for  credit  losses  also  includes  qualitative  components which  allow  management  to  reflect  the  uncertain  nature  of  economic forecasting,  capture  uncertainty  regarding  model  inputs,  and  account  for model imprecision and concentration risk.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures  relating  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the  wholesale loan  portfolio  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  (i)  the  significant  judgment  by management  when  developing  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the wholesale  loan  portfolio  using  a  modeled  approach,  (ii)  a  high  degree  of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence  related  to  management's  internal  credit  ratings,  forecasted  U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n130\n\nGoldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nAddressing  the  matter  involved  performing  procedures  and  evaluating audit  evidence  in  connection  with  forming  our  overall  opinion  on  the consolidated  financial  statements.  These  procedures  included  testing  the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, including controls over the determination of management's internal credit ratings, forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting. These procedures also included, among  others, (i) testing management's  process for developing the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using  a  modeled  approach  (ii)  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of data  used  in  the  estimate,  and  (iii)  the  involvement  of  professionals  with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of the forecast model and methodology used by management  (b)  the  reasonableness of management's  internal credit ratings,  forecasted  U.S.  unemployment  and  U.S.  GDP  growth  rates,  and (c) the reasonableness of the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nNew York, New York February 26, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1922.",

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs reports that its EaR metric is more sensitive to short-term interest rates than long-term rates, and this sensitivity is partially driven by assumptions about prepayment behavior. Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management interest rate sensitivity analysis also incorporates modeled prepayment behavior, along with reinvestment of net cash flows and deposit pricing sensitivity, to forecast net interest income changes under different rate scenarios.

      "question": "How does the decline in Charles Schwab's 2023 securities lending revenue compare to the impact of higher securities lending revenue on BlackRock's investment advisory fees, and how might this influence AIG's growing reliance on BlackRock for managing $135 billion in assets?",
      "answer": "Charles Schwab reported a $52 million decline in securities lending revenue in 2023, contrasting with BlackRock's $76 million increase in securities lending revenue, which positively impacted its investment advisory and base fee revenue. This divergence highlights differing trends in a key revenue stream between two major financial services providers. AIG, which has entrusted BlackRock with $135 billion in assets as of 2023, may see its investment advisory fees increase if this trend continues, reinforcing its financial dependence on BlackRock despite the volatility in securities lending markets.",

      "question": "How does the decline in ROTCE at SCHW compare to JPM's ROTCE performance in 2023, given that both metrics are derived from net income applicable to common equity?",
      "answer": "In 2023, SCHW reported a Return on Average Common Stockholders' Equity (ROTCE) of 16%, down from 18% in 2022, reflecting a decline in net income available to common stockholders from $6,635 million to $4,649 million. JPM, on the other hand, had a much higher net income applicable to common equity of $48,051 million in 2023, significantly above SCHW's scale, and its ROTCE (as defined by net income applicable to common equity divided by average TCE) was not explicitly stated but implies a different performance trajectory due to its larger capital base and profitability. The contrast in ROTCE trends highlights differing capital efficiency outcomes for the two firms despite both being anchored to net income applicable to common equity.",

        "Hop 2: ROTCE \u2192 Net Income Applicable to Common Equity: ROTCE is calculated as net income applicable to common equity divided by average common stockholders' equity, making it directly dependent on this metric for both firms.",

      "answer": "AIG's Life and Retirement segment generated $8,733 million in net investment income in 2019, increasing to $9,521 million in 2021, indicating a growing contribution from this segment's investment portfolio. MET, on the other hand, recognizes net investment income through a variety of mechanisms, including fair value changes for mortgage loans under FVO, straight-line recognition of rental income for real estate, and equity method accounting for joint ventures where it has significant influence. MET's approach also includes recognizing changes in fair value for certain investments at estimated values, while AIG's segment data reflects a more consolidated view of investment returns. This suggests that MET's investment income recognition is more sensitive to market valuation changes, particularly in real estate and partnerships, whereas AIG's income appears more stable and likely tied to longer-duration fixed-income assets typical of insurance portfolios.",

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\nAlso included in mortgage loans are residential mortgage loans for which the FVO was elected, and which are stated at estimated fair value. Changes in estimated fair value are recognized in net investment income.\n\nMortgage loans that are designated as held-for-sale, are carried at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value.\n\n## Policy Loans\n\nPolicy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances. Interest income is recognized as earned using the contractual interest rate.  Generally,  accrued  interest  is  capitalized  on  the  policy's  anniversary  date. Valuation  allowances  are  not  established  for policy  loans,  as  they  are  fully  collateralized  by  the  cash  surrender  value  of  the  underlying  insurance  policies. Any  unpaid principal  and  accrued  interest  are  deducted  from  the  cash  surrender  value  or  the  death  benefit  prior  to  settlement  of  the insurance policy.\n\n## Real Estate\n\nReal estate is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis, without any provision for salvage value, over the estimated useful life of the asset (typically up to 55 years). Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases. The Company periodically reviews its real estate for impairment and tests  for  recoverability  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  value  may  not  be  recoverable. Properties whose carrying values are greater than their estimated undiscounted cash flows are written down to their estimated fair  value,  which  is  generally  computed  using  the  present  value  of  expected  future  cash  flows  discounted  at  a  rate commensurate with the underlying risks.\n\nReal estate for which the Company commits to a plan to sell within one year and actively markets in its current condition for a reasonable price in comparison to its estimated fair value is classified as held-for-sale and is not depreciated. Real estate held-for-sale is stated at the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition costs.\n\n## Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership Interests\n\nThe Company uses the equity method of accounting or the FVO for real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests  ('investee')  when  it  has  more  than  a  minor  ownership  interest  or  more  than  a  minor  influence  over  the  investee's operations  but  does  not  hold  a  controlling  financial  interest,  including  when  the  Company  is  not  deemed  the  primary beneficiary of a VIE. Under the equity method, the Company recognizes in earnings within net investment income its share of the investee's earnings. Contributions paid by the Company increase carrying value and distributions received by the Company reduce carrying value. The Company generally recognizes its share of the investee's earnings on a three-month lag in instances where the investee's financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee's reporting period differs from the Company's reporting period.\n\nThe Company accounts for its interest in real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests in which it has virtually no influence over the investee's operations at estimated fair value. Unrealized gains (losses), representing changes in estimated fair value of these investments, are recognized in earnings within net investment gains (losses). Due to the nature and structure  of  these  investments,  they  do  not  meet  the  characteristics  of  an  equity  security  in  accordance  with  applicable accounting guidance.\n\nThe Company consolidates real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests of which it holds a controlling financial  interest,  or  it  is  deemed  the  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE.  Assets  of  certain  of  these  consolidated  other  limited partnership interests and real estate joint ventures are recorded at estimated fair value. Unrealized gains (losses) representing changes in estimated fair value are recognized in net investment income.\n\nThe Company routinely evaluates its equity method investments for impairment. When it is determined an equity method investment has had a loss in value that is other than temporary, it is impaired. Such an impairment is charged to net investment gains (losses).\n\n## Short-term Investments\n\nShort-term investments include highly liquid securities and other investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but greater than three months, at the time of purchase. Securities included within short-term investments are stated at estimated fair  value,  while  other  investments  included  within  short-term  investments  are  stated  at  amortized  cost  less  ACL,  which approximates estimated fair value.",

      "answer": "The divestiture of MetLife Hong Kong in 2019 resulted in a $140 million net loss (after tax), which included a $100 million pre-tax loss reflected in net investment gains (losses), thereby reducing the Asia segment's net investment income. The Asia segment contributed 30% of its net investment income from equity method investments, which was a significant portion of its financial performance. In comparison, AIG's Life and Retirement segment is significantly impacted by variances in net investment income on asset portfolios supporting insurance liabilities and surplus, indicating a similar reliance on investment performance despite differing strategic decisions around segment operations.",

      "question": "How does the growth in Goldman Sachs' residential real estate loan portfolio from 2023 to 2024 compare to Charles Schwab's loan-to-value risk profile for similar loans, given both institutions' exposure to first-lien residential mortgages?",
      "answer": "Goldman Sachs reported a 11.6% increase in its residential real estate loan portfolio from $129 million in 2023 to $144 million in 2024. As of both December 2024 and December 2023, substantially all of these loans had a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than 80%, indicating conservative underwriting. Charles Schwab, which also extends first-lien residential real estate loans, defines its LTV ratio as the principal amount of a loan divided by the value of the collateral securing the loan. Given Schwab\u2019s explicit definition and focus on collateral-backed lending, both firms maintain similar risk frameworks around LTV, though GS shows portfolio growth while Schwab emphasizes structural risk measurement rather than portfolio expansion.",

      "answer": "MetLife Holdings reported Net Investment Income of $4,234 million in 2023, a decrease from $4,633 million in 2022, which contributed to a decline in MET's Adjusted Earnings available to common shareholders from $5,793 million to $5,525 million year-over-year. In contrast, AIG experienced a $536 million increase in Net Investment Income in 2023, which was a key driver of its overall rise in Adjusted Pre-Tax Income. This indicates that while MET's Net Investment Income from MetLife Holdings slightly hurt its Adjusted Earnings, AIG's increase in Net Investment Income positively contributed to its Adjusted Pre-Tax Income.",

      "answer": "As of December 31, 2024, 82.5% (calculated from $188,314M out of $228,199M total residential mortgage loans) of BAC's residential mortgage portfolio consists of loans with FICO scores \u2265740, whereas C reports that only 36% of its portfolio falls into the same FICO \u2265740 category. This suggests that BAC's portfolio may carry lower credit risk compared to C's, as a significantly larger share of its borrowers have higher credit scores.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 \u2265740: BAC discloses that $188,314 million of its $228,199 million residential mortgage portfolio has FICO scores \u2265740, indicating a high-credit-quality segment.",

      "answer": "GS's Global Banking & Markets segment reported a 9.97% increase in compensation and benefits expenses from 2023 ($8,571 million) to 2024 ($9,426 million), reflecting a transparent and quantitative approach to disclosing workforce-related costs. In contrast, Citi's Korea VERP (voluntary early termination program) charges are only recognized in Compensation and benefits expenses when formal offers are accepted, with no specific dollar amounts disclosed yet, indicating a more conservative and event-driven reporting methodology. This reveals that GS adopts a more proactive and detailed financial disclosure strategy for workforce costs, while Citi follows a conditional, liability-triggered recognition pattern, especially in legacy business exits like Korea consumer banking.",

      "question": "How did the decline in Net Interest Revenue for Advisor Services at SCHW in 2023 impact their segment expenses, and how does this compare to BK's forward-looking guidance on Net Interest Revenue in the context of rising funding costs?",
      "answer": "SCHW's Advisor Services segment experienced a 15% decrease in total net revenues in 2023, with Net Interest Revenue declining due to higher-cost funding sources and lower average interest-earning asset balances. This contributed to a 13% increase in segment expenses excluding interest, including higher compensation and benefits expenses. BK, in contrast, acknowledges Net Interest Revenue as a key forward-looking metric, signaling strategic focus on managing this revenue stream amid similar macroeconomic pressures. BK's disclosures suggest a proactive approach to managing funding costs and interest-earning assets, which contrasts with SCHW's realized decline in Advisor Services performance.",

        "Hop 1: SCHW \u2192 Advisor Services: In 2023, Advisor Services segment expenses excluding interest increased by 13%, including higher compensation and benefits expenses, partly due to restructuring costs.",

Because our Commercial Banking business has loans and investments that generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits, we present the revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses and operating costs.\n\nOur Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion, $65 million and $621 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nTable 10 summarizes the financial results of our Commercial Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.\n\n64\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "Capital One's Auto lending portfolio totaled $2,674 million in 2024, which is a significant component of its broader Consumer Banking segment. In contrast, Bank of America reported a total Consumer Banking segment of $30,137 million in the same period. This suggests that while Capital One has a meaningful allocation to Auto lending within consumer banking, Bank of America's Consumer Banking footprint is much larger and likely more diversified across products beyond auto financing.",

      "question": "How did fluctuations in equity markets during 2023 impact AIG's net amount at risk, and how does this exposure compare to MetLife's definition of net amount at risk in relation to death benefit claims and current account balances?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AIG noted that equity market performance significantly impacted its net amount at risk, particularly in variable annuity separate accounts and other equity-linked products, as account values fluctuated with market returns. This exposure directly affected fee income and hedging costs. For MetLife, the net amount at risk is defined as the current death benefit in excess of the current account balance, representing the potential claim exposure if death claims were filed on all contracts. Both companies tie net amount at risk to account values, meaning equity market fluctuations similarly influence their risk profiles and financial obligations under death benefit guarantees.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Net Amount at Risk: AIG discloses that equity market performance in 2023 impacted its net amount at risk, particularly in variable annuity separate accounts and other equity-linked products, affecting fee income and hedging costs.",
        "Hop 2: Net Amount at Risk \u2192 Current Account Balance: MetLife defines net amount at risk as the death benefit in excess of the current account balance, directly tying it to account values that fluctuate with equity markets.",

      "answer": "AIG values its municipal bond obligations using discounted cash flow techniques that incorporate yield assumptions, with a weighted average yield of 3.11% for states, municipalities, and political subdivisions as of December 31, 2020. Meanwhile, MET discloses that under a declining interest rate scenario for 2023, the 30-year U.S. Treasury rate would fall to 1.50%, down from 2.00% in the base scenario. This suggests that both firms are modeling sensitivity to interest rate movements, with AIG directly applying yield inputs to asset valuation and MET simulating broader macroeconomic impacts through Treasury rate scenarios.",

      "answer": "For AXP, a +200 basis point interest rate shock increases the economic value of equity, as their sensitivity profile shows that equity generally rises in an increasing rate environment. For COF, the same shock results in a 6.3% decrease in economic value of equity as of December 31, 2024. This indicates that AXP's asset-liability structure is more resilient or even positively impacted by rising rates, whereas COF experiences a material decline in equity value under the same scenario.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a) Negative values represent a reduction in net interest income.\n\nWe use economic value of equity to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on the net present value of our assets and liabilities under a variety of interest rate scenarios. Economic value of equity is calculated based on our existing assets, liabilities and derivatives, and does not incorporate projected changes in our balance sheet. Key assumptions used in this calculation include the term structure of interest rates, as well as deposit repricing and liquidation profiles used to inform duration and cash flow schedules. The economic value of equity is calculated under multiple interest rate scenarios, including baseline and immediate upward and immediate downward interest rate shocks, to assess its sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Our current sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases in a declining interest rate scenario and increases in an increasing interest rate scenario. The level of this sensitivity is managed within board-approved policy limits.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.\n\nThese foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2024, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $43 billion were outstanding.\n\nWith respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of December 31, 2024. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2024. With respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the nex t twelve months, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net of hedges, would be approximately $136 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nThe actual impact of interest rate and foreign ex change rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.",

      "answer": "AIG's Net Amount at Risk is directly impacted by equity market performance through variable annuity separate accounts and equity-exposed securities, which affects account values and, in turn, the net amount at risk. MetLife defines its Claim Amount for death benefits as the excess of the current death benefit over the account balance, representing the company's exposure if all death claims were filed at the balance sheet date. This means both companies face exposure through the Net Amount at Risk, but AIG's sensitivity to equity markets introduces an additional layer of volatility that could amplify or mitigate its risk depending on market conditions.",

        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Net Amount at Risk: AIG's Net Amount at Risk is influenced by equity market performance, particularly through variable annuity separate accounts and equity-exposed securities, which fluctuate with market conditions.",
        "Hop 2: Net Amount at Risk \u2192 Claim Amount: The Net Amount at Risk for life insurance products is defined as the excess death benefit over the account balance, which directly corresponds to the potential claim amount the insurer would incur.",
        "Hop 3: Claim Amount \u2190 MET: MetLife explicitly discloses that its Claim Amount for death benefits is calculated as the current death benefit in excess of the account balance, representing the insurer's economic exposure if all death claims were filed at the balance sheet date."

      "answer": "MetLife defines the net amount at risk as the excess of the current death benefit over the account balance, representing the claim amount the company would incur if all death claims were filed at the balance sheet date. This metric is directly tied to the company's exposure to claim amounts under life insurance contracts. AIG, on the other hand, notes that its net amount at risk is influenced by equity market performance, particularly in variable annuity products, where account values fluctuate with equity markets. AIG further explains that changes in equity markets affect both fee income and hedging costs associated with these products. Therefore, while MetLife's net amount at risk is driven by mortality-based claim exposure, AIG's net amount at risk is more closely tied to financial market volatility, especially equity market returns and volatility indices like the VIX, which directly influence both fee income and hedging costs.",

        "Hop 3: Net Amount at Risk \u2190 AIG: AIG's net amount at risk is influenced by equity market performance, particularly in variable annuities, where account values and hedging costs fluctuate with equity markets and volatility indices like the VIX."

In contrast, BAC allocates $188,314 million to loans with FICO scores \u2265740, suggesting a much stronger emphasis on high-credit-quality borrowers. This disparity implies that BAC is more heavily positioned in the prime credit segment, potentially reducing its credit risk exposure compared to C, which has a more balanced distribution across credit tiers.

      "answer": "MetLife's U.S. captive life reinsurance subsidiaries, specifically MRV, reported a statutory capital and surplus of $723 million and $726 million at the end of 2023 and 2022, respectively. This capital position was significantly enhanced by a $2.0 billion increase due to the inclusion of letters of credit as admitted assets, a prescribed accounting practice approved by the Vermont regulator. Without this adjustment, MRV's Risk-Based Capital (RBC) would have triggered a regulatory event. In contrast, AIG's statutory financial disclosures indicate that its Life and Retirement companies are also subject to statutory accounting practices, but AIG does not provide specific capital and surplus figures for its captive reinsurance entities or similar adjustments. Therefore, while both firms operate under statutory frameworks, MetLife's U.S. captive life reinsurance segment demonstrates a more precarious regulatory capital position that is directly dependent on state-prescribed accounting practices, a factor not evident in the AIG disclosures provided.",

        "Hop 3: U.S. Captive Life Reinsurance Subsidiaries \u2190 MET: MetLife's captive subsidiaries, particularly MRV, rely on state-prescribed accounting practices to maintain regulatory capital adequacy, a practice that would otherwise trigger an RBC regulatory event without such adjustments."

      "answer": "COF's sensitivity analysis shows that a +100 basis points interest rate increase would reduce its Economic Value of Equity (EVE) by 3.0% in 2024 and 3.7% in 2023, indicating declining resilience to rate hikes. In contrast, SCHW explicitly highlights managing EVE and asset/liability duration as a core component of its interest rate risk framework, though it does not provide specific quantitative impacts. This suggests COF takes a more quantitatively defensive posture, while SCHW integrates EVE into a broader strategic risk management approach without disclosing specific sensitivity thresholds.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nIn addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as 'believe,' 'anticipate,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'will,' 'may,' 'estimate,' 'appear,' 'could,' 'would,' 'expand,' 'aim,' 'maintain,' 'continue,' 'seek,' and other similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to ex pectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements, which reflect management's beliefs, objectives, and expectations as of the date hereof, are estimates based on the best judgment of Schwab's senior management. These statements relate to, among other things:\n\n- Maximizing our market valuation and stockholder returns over time; our belief that developing trusted relationships will translate into more client assets which drives revenue and, along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management, generates earnings growth and builds stockholder value (see Business Strategy and Competitive Environment, and Products and Services in Part I - Item 1);\n- Capital expenditures and expense management (see Results of Operations in Overview and Results of Operations - Total Expenses Excluding Interest in Part II - Item 7);\n- Net interest revenue, the adjustment of rates paid on client-related liabilities, and client cash realignment activity (see Results of Operations - Net Interest Revenue in Part II - Item 7);\n- Utilization of bank supplemental funding and expectations for repayment of outstanding balances (see Results of Operations in Part II - Item 7, and Liquidity Risk in Part II - Item 7);\n- Management of interest rate risk; modeling and assumptions, the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest margin and revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, economic value of equity, and liability and asset duration (see Risk Management in Part II - Item 7);\n- Sources and uses of liquidity (see Liquidity Risk in Part II - Item 7);\n- Capital management; potential migration of IDA balances to our balance sheet; capital accretion; expectations about capital requirements, including AOCI; long-term operating objective; and uses of capital and return of excess capital to stockholders, including dividends and repurchases (see Capital Management - Regulatory Capital Requirements in Part II - Item 7; and Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15);\n- The expected impact of proposed and final rules (see Current Regulatory and Other Developments in Part II - Item 7);\n- The expected impact of new accounting standards not yet adopted (see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 2);\n- The likelihood of indemnification and guarantee payment obligations and clients failing to fulfill contractual obligations (see Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15, and Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk - Client Trade Settlement in Note 18); and\n- The outcome and impact of legal proceedings and regulatory matters (see Commitments and Contingencies in Part II - Item 8 - Note 15, and Legal Proceedings in Part I - Item 3).\n\nAchievement of the expressed beliefs, objectives and expectations described in these statements is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the ex pressed beliefs, objectives, and ex pectations. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference, as of the date of those documents.\n\nImportant factors that may cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to:\n\n- General market conditions, including the level of interest rates, equity market valuations and volatility;\n- Our ability to attract and retain clients, develop trusted relationships, and grow client assets;\n- Client use of our advisory and lending solutions and other products and services;\n- The level of client assets, including cash balances;\n- Client cash allocations and sensitivity to deposit rates;\n- The level and mix of client trading activity, including daily average trades, margin balances, and balance sheet cash;\n- Regulatory guidance and adverse impacts from new or changed legislation, rulemaking or regulatory expectations;\n- Capital and liquidity needs and management;",

      "question": "How does Morgan Stanley's allocation of average common equity to its business segments compare with Goldman Sachs' average common equity in the Global Banking & Markets segment, and what does this suggest about their respective capital utilization strategies in investment banking?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley allocates average common equity to its business segments using its Required Capital Framework, which is tied to regulatory requirements and used to calculate performance metrics like ROTCE, with a stated goal of 20%. In contrast, Goldman Sachs reports that its Global Banking & Markets segment had an average common equity of $75.8 billion in 2024, which generated a return on average common equity of 14.5%. This suggests that while both firms utilize average common equity as a key capital metric, Goldman Sachs' significantly higher allocation to its core investment banking segment indicates a more concentrated capital deployment strategy in this area compared to Morgan Stanley's broader segment-based capital framework.",

        "Hop 1: Morgan Stanley \u2192 Average Common Equity: MS allocates average common equity across business segments using the Required Capital Framework, which informs ROTCE calculations with a 20% target return.",

Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined  using  our  Required  Capital  framew ork  (see  'Liquidity  and  Capital  ResourcesRegulatory  Requirements-Attribution  of  Average  Common  Equity  According  to  the  Required Capital Framew ork' herein). T he sums of the segments' Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent Company equity.\n\n2. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to M organ Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment, annualized as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment.\n\n## Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal\n\nWe  have  an  ROTCE  goal  of  20%.  Our  ROTCE  goal  is  a  forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors.\n\nSee  'Risk  Factors'  and  'Forward-Looking  Statements'  herein  for  further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results.\n\nROTCE represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see 'Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information' herein.\n\n## Business Segments\n\nSubstantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been  allocated  to  each  business  segment,  generally  in  proportion  to  its respective  net  revenues,  non-interest  ex penses  or  other  relevant  measures. See Note 22 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions.\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\n## Net Revenues\n\n## Investment Banking\n\nInvestment banking revenues are derived from client engagements in which we act as an advisor, underwriter or distributor of capital.\n\nWithin  the  Institutional  Securities  business  segment,  these  revenues  are primarily composed of fees earned from underwriting equity and fixed income securities, syndicating loans and advisory services in relation to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures and corporate restructurings.\n\nWithin  the  Wealth  Management  business  segment,  these  revenues  are derived from the distribution of newly issued securities.\n\n## Trading\n\nTrading revenues include the realized gains and losses from transactions in financial  instruments,  unrealized  gains  and  losses  from  ongoing  changes  in the fair value of our positions, and gains and losses from financial instruments used to economically hedge compensation expense related to DCP.\n\nWithin the Institutional Securities business segment, Trading revenues arise from transactions in cash instruments and derivatives in which we act as a market  maker  for  our  clients.  In  this  role,  we  stand  ready  to  buy,  sell  or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide  firm  or  indicative  prices  in  response  to  customer  requests.  Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to:\n\n- taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell and-depending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the position-to hold those positions for a period of time;\n- building,  maintaining  and  rebalancing  inventory  held  to  facilitate  client activity through trades with other market participants;\n- managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between risks incurred  from  the  facilitation  of  client  transactions  and  the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks;\n- trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and\n- engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets.\n\nIn many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from purchase and  sale  transactions  will  include  any  spreads  between  bids  and  offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value.",

      "question": "How does AIG's 'Other Operations' segment contribution to DPAC amortization in 2021 compare to the total amortization across all segments, and what does this suggest about its role in underwriting efficiency relative to the broader business?",
      "answer": "In 2021, AIG's 'Other Operations' segment reported $70 million in DPAC amortization, compared to the total DPAC amortization across all segments of $4,573 million. This means 'Other Operations' accounted for just 1.5% of total DPAC amortization. Given that DPAC amortization reflects the recognition of policy acquisition costs in earnings, this low percentage suggests that 'Other Operations' played a minimal role in underwriting activity compared to the larger segments like General Insurance and Life and Retirement, indicating either a smaller or less capital-intensive contribution to new policy acquisition.",

        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 DPAC: MET is subject to accounting policies that include Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DPAC), indicating its relevance to insurance operations.",

      "question": "Given MET's extension of $522 million in commercial loans with a 1.0% book value impact, how does this maturity extension strategy position the company in light of the declining U.S. real GDP growth projections from 2.0% in Q2 2025 to 1.8% in Q2 2026?",
      "answer": "MET's extension of $522 million in commercial loans with a 1.0% book value impact suggests a strategy to manage credit exposure amid economic uncertainty. JPM's projections show a declining U.S. real GDP growth trajectory from 2.0% in Q2 2025 to 1.8% in Q2 2026, indicating a slowing economic environment. This downward trend in growth may increase credit risk for extended loans, as weaker economic conditions could affect borrowers' ability to repay. MET's decision to extend maturities despite this outlook may reflect confidence in borrower stability or an effort to maintain client relationships during a period of expected economic moderation.",

        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 Commercial Loan Extensions: MET extended $522 million in commercial loans with a 1.0% book value impact, indicating a strategic maturity management decision.",
        "Hop 2: Commercial Loan Extensions \u2192 U.S. Real GDP Growth: Loan performance is closely tied to macroeconomic conditions, particularly GDP growth, which influences borrower repayment capacity.",

      "answer": "PYPL reported only 3,000 loan accounts in 2021 with a weighted average payment term extension of 36 months, down from 13,000 accounts and 37 months in 2020, indicating a significant reduction in both account volume and payment flexibility. In contrast, COF had 4,000 troubled debt restructured accounts in 2021 under its Other Loans category, with an average payment term extension of 16 months, suggesting a more targeted but longer-term restructuring approach. This highlights a stark contrast in how the two companies managed loan portfolios during periods of financial stress, with COF focusing on term extensions for a smaller group of distressed borrowers, while PYPL saw a broader contraction in lending activity.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan's Commercial & Investment Bank segment equity increased from $132.0 billion in 2024 to $149.5 billion by January 1, 2025, representing a year-over-year growth of $17.5 billion (13.2%). This growth coincided with JPMorgan's strategic reorganization in Q2 2024 that emphasized market-making as a core activity within the newly combined segment, reflecting a deliberate capital and operational focus. Meanwhile, Bank of America reported $12,967 million in revenue from market-making and similar activities during 2024, a slight increase from $12,732 million in 2023. While BAC's market-making revenue grew modestly, JPM's larger capital allocation to its CIB segment suggests a stronger strategic emphasis on expanding its market-making footprint relative to BAC\u2019s more measured revenue growth in the same area.",

      "question": "How does the change in unearned premiums for AIG's Life and Retirement segment in 2023 compare to MetLife's accounting policy for recognizing short-duration insurance premiums, and what does this imply about their respective revenue recognition timing for such products?",
      "answer": "AIG's Life and Retirement segment reported unearned premiums of $11 million in 2023, a significant decline from $59 million in 2022, indicating a change in premium recognition or policy activity. MetLife recognizes short-duration insurance premiums on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term, with unearned premiums reflected as liabilities until earned. This suggests that AIG's lower unearned premiums may reflect either a smaller base of short-duration policies or faster recognition of premiums into earnings compared to MetLife\u2019s pro rata approach, which would affect the timing and predictability of revenue streams in their Life and Retirement businesses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Life and Retirement: AIG\u2019s Life and Retirement segment had $11 million in unearned premiums in 2023, down from $59 million in 2022, indicating a material shift in premium recognition or policy dynamics.",
        "Hop 2: Life and Retirement \u2192 Unearned Premiums: AIG discloses unearned premiums as part of its Life and Retirement segment financials, showing a significant year-over-year decline.",
        "Hop 3: Unearned Premiums \u2190 MET: MetLife recognizes short-duration insurance premiums on a pro rata basis over the contract term, with unearned premiums held as liabilities until earned, which informs how such premiums are treated in the industry."

      "question": "How does the trend in policy charges for AIG's Individual Retirement segment in 2023 compare to the changes in MetLife's RIS - Annuities segment balance over the same period, and what might this indicate about their respective annuities business strategies?",
      "answer": "AIG reported a policy charge of $840 million for its Individual Retirement segment in 2023, showing a slight decrease from $870 million in 2022, indicating relatively stable revenue from fees in this segment. Meanwhile, MetLife's RIS - Annuities segment balance decreased from $11,694 million at the end of 2022 to $11,659 million at the end of 2023, suggesting a minor contraction in this business line. This comparison indicates that while AIG maintained a consistent fee structure in its annuities offering, MetLife experienced a slight decline in its annuities segment balance, potentially signaling a more cautious approach or market pressures affecting its annuities business.",

Economic value of equity is calculated based on our existing assets, liabilities and derivatives, and does not incorporate projected changes in our balance sheet. Key assumptions used in this calculation include the term structure of interest rates, as well as deposit repricing and liquidation profiles used to inform duration and cash flow schedules. The economic value of equity is calculated under multiple interest rate scenarios, including baseline and immediate upward and immediate downward interest rate shocks, to assess its sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Our current sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases in a declining interest rate scenario and increases in an increasing interest rate scenario. The level of this sensitivity is managed within board-approved policy limits.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.\n\nThese foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2024, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $43 billion were outstanding.\n\nWith respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of December 31, 2024. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2024. With respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the nex t twelve months, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net of hedges, would be approximately $136 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\nThe actual impact of interest rate and foreign ex change rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses.",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements set by the OCC, which mandates that they remain 'well-capitalized' under Prompt Corrective Action standards to maintain the firm's status as a Financial Holding Company. This influences their exposure to riskier assets like residential real estate loans, as failure to meet these capital thresholds could trigger regulatory actions that directly impact financial statements. Within this context, MS's U.S. Bank Subsidiaries provide residential real estate loans as part of their lending activities, particularly through the Wealth Management segment. This exposure is managed under regulatory constraints that directly shape how much risk they can absorb. In contrast, JPM reports that for residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (>150 days past due) and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios are key indicators of credit quality and potential loss severity. High LTV ratios combined with low borrower FICO scores significantly increase default risk. Therefore, while MS must manage its residential real estate loan exposure under strict capital adequacy rules, JPM's risk management for similar loans is more directly influenced by borrower-level credit metrics and regional economic factors affecting collateral value.",

Loans that are more than 30 days past due prov ide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans v ary based on the class of loan, as follows:\n\n- For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss sev erity in the ev ent of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can prov ide insight into a borrower's continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also prov ides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific ev ents such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower's current or 'refreshed' FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower's credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.\n- For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution prov ides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activ ity and ev ents.",

In 2024, USPB's loan portfolio was dominated by credit card products, which accounted for approximately 77% of EOP loans and drove 95% of total USPB net credit losses.

Retail Banking is concentrated in six  major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also provides mortgages through correspondent channels.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 77% of USPB EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of USPB , as Branded Cards and Retail Services net credit losses represented approximately 95% of total USPB net credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Branded Cards and Retail Services represented 69% and 31%, respectively, of EOP cards loans in USPB .\n\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in USPB was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.\n\nThe 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years.

In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.\n\nUSPB 's Branded Cards portfolio consists of both proprietary Citi branded cards portfolios (Value, Rewards and Cash) and co-branded cards portfolios (including Costco and American Airlines). Citi's Branded Cards portfolio benefits from a diverse combination of products. Citi's proprietary cards provide customers with a suite of products with rewards, cash rebates and lending solutions, while co-branded cards provide significant affinity benefits through partnerships with large-scale partners across the airline, retail and telecom sectors.\n\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Branded Cards was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter.

      "answer": "In 2021, Charles Schwab's Investor Services segment experienced a 68% increase in net revenues, largely due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results following the acquisition in October 2020. This significant growth was supported by increases across all revenue line items, including trading revenue, asset management and administration fees, and bank deposit account fees. Meanwhile, PayPal reported total net revenues of $25.371 billion in 2021. While PayPal maintained a larger overall revenue base, Schwab's Investor Services segment demonstrated a much higher growth rate, indicating a more aggressive expansion in its core financial services offerings during that year. This comparison suggests that Schwab was experiencing outsized growth from integration and scale effects post-acquisition, while PayPal was operating from a more mature and stable revenue base.",

Both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results in 2021. In addition, net interest revenue increased for Advisor Services due to growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances. The increase in trading revenue for Investor Services was supported by heightened client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020, following the October 6, 2020 TD Ameritrade acquisition.\n\nInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services' growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets.\n\n## Segment Expenses Excluding Interest\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50% and 35%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of TD Ameritrade's results of operations. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, higher bonus accrual, as well as annual merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter (see Item 8 - Note 15).\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services' expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment's client base and greater client base growth from TDA.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSchwab's business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.\n\nOur risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.",

      "question": "How does Morgan Stanley's exposure to commercial real estate loans in its Institutional Securities segment compare with Bank of America's reliance on financial advisory services revenue from similar sectors, particularly given the $12,218 million CRE loan book at Morgan Stanley and $1,504 million in sector-linked advisory fees at Bank of America?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities segment reported $12,218 million in commercial and residential real estate loans at year-end 2023, indicating significant exposure to the real estate sector. This exposure creates potential credit risk tied to property values and leasing markets. Meanwhile, Bank of America generated $1,504 million in financial advisory services revenue from sectors aligned with real estate activity, which includes services like M&A advisory and capital raising for real estate clients. This suggests Bank of America is monetizing its advisory capabilities in sectors where Morgan Stanley faces direct loan exposure. While Morgan Stanley bears balance sheet risk from real estate lending, Bank of America earns fee income by advising firms in those same sectors, reflecting different risk-return profiles in their respective institutional business models.",

        "Hop 1: MS \u2192 Institutional Securities: Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities segment holds $12,218 million in commercial and residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2023, indicating significant sector exposure.",
        "Hop 2: Institutional Securities \u2192 Financial Advisory Services: Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities business includes financial advisory services such as M&A advice and capital raising, which are directly relevant to real estate sector clients.",

Introduction and Basis of Presentation\n\n## The Firm\n\nMorgan Stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market  positions  in  each  of  its  business  segments-Institutional  Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms 'Morgan Stanley' or the 'Firm' mean Morgan  Stanley  (the  'Parent  Company')  together  with  its  consolidated subsidiaries.  See  the  'G lossary  of  Common  Terms  and Acronyms'  for  the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this Form 10-K.\n\nA description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the Firm's business segments is as follows:\n\nInstitutional  Securities  provides  a  variety  of  products  and  services  to corporations,  governments, financial  institutions  and  ultra-high  net  worth clients. Investment Banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including the underwriting of debt, equity securities and other products, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and project finance. Our Equity and Fixed Income businesses include  sales,  financing,  prime  brokerage,  market-making,  Asia  wealth management  services  and  certain  business-related  investments.  Lending activities  include  originating  corporate  loans  and  commercial  real  estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending securities-based and other financing to clients. Other activities include research.\n\nWealth Management provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to medium-sized businesses and institutions. Wealth Management covers: financial advisor-led brokerage, custody, administrative and investment advisory services; selfdirected brokerage services; financial and wealth planning services; workplace  services,  including  stock  plan  administration;  securities-based lending,  residential  and  commercial  real  estate  loans  and  other  lending products; banking; and retirement plan services.\n\nInvestment Management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. Strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fix ed income, alternatives and solutions,  and  liquidity  and  overlay  services.  Institutional  clients  include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations,  endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. Individual  clients  are  generally  served  through  intermediaries,  including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.\n\n## Basis of Financial Information\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of  certain  financial  instruments,  the  valuations  of  goodwill  and  intangible assets,  the  outcome  of  legal  and  tax   matters,  deferred  tax   assets, ACL,  and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm  believes  that  the  estimates  utilized  in  the  preparation  of  its  financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\n\nThe Notes are an integral part of the Firm's financial statements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements  through  the  date  of  this  report  and  has  not  identified  any recordable  or  disclosable  events  not  otherwise  reported  in  these  financial statements or the notes thereto.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries  and  other  entities  in  which  the  Firm  has  a  controlling  financial interest,  including  certain  V IEs  (see  Note  15).  Intercompany  balances  and transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as Noncontrolling  interests.  The  net  income  attributable  to  Noncontrolling interests  for  such  subsidiaries  is  presented  as  Net  income  applicable  to noncontrolling interests in the income statement. The portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented  as  Noncontrolling  interests,  a  component  of  Total  equity,  in  the balance sheet.\n\nFor entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity  to  finance  its  activities  without  additional  subordinated  financial support and the equity holders bear the residual economic risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly  affect  its  economic  performance,  the  Firm  consolidates  those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. For VIEs  (i.e.,  entities  that  do  not  meet  the  aforementioned  criteria),  the  Firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most  significantly  affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  V IE  and  has  the obligation  to  absorb  losses  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  that  could potentially be significant to the V IE.\n\nFor  investments  in  entities  in  which  the  Firm  does  not  have  a  controlling financial  interest  but  has  significant  influence  over  operating  and  financial decisions, it applies the equity method",

      "answer": "Schwab evaluates long-term interest rates as part of its qualitative goodwill impairment assessment, considering them among macroeconomic factors that could affect reporting unit valuations. In contrast, Goldman Sachs discloses that its Economic Risk Metric (EaR) is more sensitive to short-term interest rates than long-term ones, based on assumptions around balance sheet dynamics and repricing behavior. While both firms incorporate interest rate sensitivity into their risk frameworks, Schwab's approach is qualitative and tied to asset valuation, whereas Goldman Sachs quantifies sensitivity with an emphasis on short-term rates.",

Impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this ex cess, with the max imum charge limited to the carrying value of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Our annual impairment testing date is April 1 . Schwab can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit ex ceeds its carrying value.

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\nSchwab also enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on these arrangements, see Item 8 - Notes 7, 11, 13, 15, and 17. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, certain brokerage client deposits are required to be swept off-balance sheet to the TD Depository Institutions. We also maintain agreements pursuant to which certain client brokerage cash deposits are swept to other third-party depository institutions. See Item 8 - Notes 3 and 15 for additional information on the IDA agreement.\n\n## CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nSchwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth inclusive of migration of IDA balances (see further discussion below), providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab's primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios.\n\nInternal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries' capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for CS&amp;Co. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity's needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.\n\nSchwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes - including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company's capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.\n\nFor additional information, see Business - Regulation in Part I, Item 1.\n\n## Regulatory Capital Requirements\n\nCSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%, and we have a long-term operating objective of 6.75%-7.00%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC's asset growth.\n\nOur banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries' failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab's principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2021, CSB is considered well capitalized.",

          "chunk_text": "Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of 4Q24, U.S. real GDP growth is expected to slow during 2025 and 2026, while the unemployment rate is expected to increase in 2025, but decline in 2026.\n\nThe macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into consideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and other macroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis.\n\nCiti's downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the base scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario, Citi's downside scenario reflects a recession, including an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8% over the eight-quarter R&amp;S period, with a peak difference of 3.4% in the second quarter of 2026. The downside scenario also reflects a year-over-year U.S. real G DP contraction in 2025 of 1.8%, with a peak quarter-overquarter difference to the base scenario of 1.3%.\n\nThe following are the main factors and interpretations that Citi considers when estimating the ACL under the CECL methodology:\n\n- CECL reserves are estimated over the contractual term of the financial asset, which is adjusted for expected prepayments. Expected extensions are generally not considered unless the option to extend the loan cannot be canceled unilaterally by Citi.\n- Credit enhancements that are not freestanding (such as those that are included in the original terms of the contract or those executed in conjunction with the lending transaction) are considered loss mitigants for purposes of CECL reserve estimation.\n- For unconditionally cancelable accounts (generally credit cards), reserves are based on the expected life of the balance as of the evaluation date (assuming no further charges) and do not include any undrawn commitments that are unconditionally cancelable. Reserves are included for undrawn commitments for accounts that are not unconditionally cancelable (such as letters of credit and corporate loan commitments, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), undrawn mortgage loan commitments and financial guarantees).\n- CECL models are designed to be economically sensitive. They utilize the macroeconomic forecasts provided by Citi's enterprise scenario group that are approved by senior management. Analysis is performed and documented to determine the necessary qualitative management adjustment (QMA) to capture idiosyncratic events and model uncertainty.\n- The portion of the forecast that reflects the enterprise scenario group's R&amp;S period indicates the maximum length of time its models can produce a R&amp;S macroeconomic forecast, after which mean reversion reflecting historical loss experience is used for the remaining life of the loan to estimate expected credit losses. For the loss forecast, businesses consume the macroeconomic forecast as determined to be appropriate and justifiable.\n\nCiti's ability to forecast credit losses over the R&amp;S period is based on the ability to forecast economic activity over a reasonable and supportable time window. The R&amp;S period reflects the overall ability to have a reasonable and supportable forecast of credit loss based on economic forecasts. The R&amp;S forecast period for consumer and corporate loans is eight quarters.\n\n- The loss models consume all or a portion of the R&amp;S economic forecast and then revert to historical loss ex perience.\n- The ACL incorporates provisions for accrued interest on products that are not subject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy (e.g., credit cards, etc.).\n- Citi uses the most recent available information to inform its macroeconomic forecasts, allowing sufficient time for analysis of the results and corresponding approvals. Key variables are reviewed for significant changes through year end and changes to portfolio positions are reflected in the ACL.\n- Reserves are calculated at an appropriately granular level and on a pooled basis where financial assets share risk characteristics. At a minimum, reserves are calculated at a portfolio level (product and country). Where a financial asset does not share risk characteristics with any of the pools, it is evaluated for credit losses individually.\n\n## Quantitative and Qualitative Components of the ACL\n\nThe loss likelihood and severity models use both internal and external information and are sensitive to forecasts of different macroeconomic conditions. For the quantitative component, Citi uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios and associated probabilities to estimate the ECL. Estimates of these ECLs are based upon (i) Citigroup's internal system of credit risk ratings, (ii) historical default and loss data, including comprehensive internal history and rating agency information regarding default rates and internal data on the severity of losses in the event of default, and (iii) a R&amp;S forecast of future macroeconomic conditions. ECL is determined primarily by utilizing models for the borrowers' PD, LGD and EAD. Adjustments may be made to this data, including (i) statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle, the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans and the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global portfolio, and (ii) adjustments made for specifically known items, such as current environmental factors and credit trends.\n\nAny adjustments needed to the modeled expected losses in the quantitative calculations are addressed through a qualitative adjustment. The qualitative adjustment considers, among other things: certain portfolio characteristics and concentrations; collateral coverage; model limitations; idiosyncratic events; and other relevant criteria under banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The qualitative adjustment also reflects the estimated impact of the pandemic on the economic forecasts and the impact on credit loss estimates. The total ACL is composed of the quantitative and qualitative components. Citi's qualitative component declined year-over-year, primarily driven by (i) the full release of COV ID-19-",

      "question": "Given the regulatory capital requirements for MS's U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and their significant exposure to commercial real estate loans, how does the phase-in of CECL adjustments as of January 1, 2025, impact their capital ratios relative to JPM's CRE loan portfolio distribution across maturities?",
      "answer": "The phase-in of CECL adjustments for MS's U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, which were fully phased-in by January 1, 2025, directly affects their risk-weighted capital ratios by increasing capital deductions tied to loan loss reserves. This regulatory capital sensitivity to credit risk is critical as MS's U.S. Bank Subsidiaries have significant exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) loans, a key component of their lending activities. JPM's CRE loan distribution shows $170.163 billion in total CRE loans, with $57.967 billion maturing between 5\u201315 years, a segment that may carry higher risk-weighted asset implications. Therefore, the full CECL phase-in at MS could disproportionately impact their capital ratios compared to JPM, especially if their CRE loan maturity profile mirrors JPM's, given the higher capital deductions on longer-duration CRE exposures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MS \u2192 U.S. Bank Subsidiaries: MS's U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to OCC capital requirements, and the full phase-in of CECL adjustments as of January 1, 2025, affects their risk-based capital ratios and adjusted average assets.",
        "Hop 2: U.S. Bank Subsidiaries \u2192 Commercial Real Estate Loans: CRE loans are a major component of the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries' lending activity, particularly from the Institutional Securities business segment, making their capital ratios sensitive to CRE credit risk.",

Adjusted  average  assets  represents  the  denominator  of  the  T ier  1  leverage  ratio  and  is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallow ed goodw ill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in our ow n capital instruments, certain deferred tax assets and other capital deductions.\n\n3. Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented.\n\n2. Supplementary  leverage  exposure  is  the  sum  of  Adjusted  average  assets  used  in  the  T ier  1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.\n\n## U.S. Bank Subsidiaries' Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios\n\nThe OCC establishes capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the Firm's regulatory capital requirements, although G -SIB capital surcharge and SCB requirements do not apply to the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.\n\nThe  OCC's regulatory  capital  framework  includes  Prompt  Corrective Action ('PCA') standards, including 'well-capitalized' PCA standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. For the Firm to remain an FHC, its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the OCC's PCA standards. In addition, failure by the  U.S.  Bank  Subsidiaries to meet  minimum  capital  requirements  may  result  in  certain  mandatory  and discretionary  actions  by  regulators  that,  if  undertaken,  could  have  a  direct material  effect  on  the  U.S.  Bank  Subsidiaries'  and  the  Firm's  financial statements.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, MSBNA and MSPBNA riskbased capital ratios are based on the Standardized Approach rules. Beginning on January 1, 2020, MSBNA and MSPBNA elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on risk-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted  average  assets  and  supplementary  leverage  exposure  calculations, over a five-year transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from January 1, 2022 and were phased-in at 75% from January 1, 2024. The deferral impacts were fully phased-in from January 1, 2025.\n\n## MSBNA's Regulatory Capital\n\n",

      "question": "How does AXP's small business loan portfolio compare to C's USPB segment's small business loan exposure in terms of dollar value and credit risk trends as of December 31, 2024?",
      "answer": "As of December 31, 2024, AXP reported a total Small Business Loan portfolio of $31,991 million, while Citi\u2019s USPB segment reported that approximately 77% of its EOP loans included small business loans, though the exact dollar value is not disclosed. AXP\u2019s Small Business Loans due after one year at fixed interest rates amounted to $359 million, indicating a largely short-term portfolio. C\u2019s USPB noted rising net credit loss rates year-over-year, primarily due to the maturation of recent loan vintages and macroeconomic pressures like inflation and interest rates, especially among lower FICO band borrowers. This suggests that while AXP\u2019s small business loan book appears more stable and short-dated, C\u2019s USPB segment is experiencing elevated credit risk in its broader consumer and small business loan portfolio.",

Retail Banking is concentrated in six  major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also provides mortgages through correspondent channels.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 77% of USPB EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of USPB , as Branded Cards and Retail Services net credit losses represented approximately 95% of total USPB net credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Branded Cards and Retail Services represented 69% and 31%, respectively, of EOP cards loans in USPB .\n\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in USPB was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.\n\nThe 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.\n\nUSPB 's Branded Cards portfolio consists of both proprietary Citi branded cards portfolios (Value, Rewards and Cash) and co-branded cards portfolios (including Costco and American Airlines). Citi's Branded Cards portfolio benefits from a diverse combination of products. Citi's proprietary cards provide customers with a suite of products with rewards, cash rebates and lending solutions, while co-branded cards provide significant affinity benefits through partnerships with large-scale partners across the airline, retail and telecom sectors.\n\nAs presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2024 net credit loss rate in Branded Cards was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years.

JC B figures include other paym entrelated products and som e figures are estim ates. M astercard excludes M aestro and C irrus figures. (1)\n\nT otal volum e is the sum  of paym ents volum e and cash volum e. C ash volum e generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. (2)\n\nLocal and Regional Networks: Operated in many countries, these networks often hav e the support of gov ernment influence or mandate. In some cases, they are owned by financial institutions or payment processors. These networks typically focus on debit payment products, and may hav e strong local acceptance, and recognizable brands. Examples include NYCE, Pulse and STAR in the U.S.; Interac in Canada; and eftpos in Australia.\n\nAlternative Payments Providers: T hese prov iders, such as closed commerce ecosystems, BNPL solutions and cryptocurrency platforms, often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels; howev er, they are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale. T hese companies may process payments using in-house account transfers between parties, electronic funds transfer networks like  the ACH, global or local networks like  Visa, or some combination of the foregoing.  In some cases, these entities can be both a partner and a competitor to Visa.\n\nRTP Networks: RTP networks have launched in at least 80 countries and continue to be driv en by strong gov ernment sponsorship and regulatory initiativ es to enable and driv e adoption (e.g., FedNow in the U.S., PIX  in Brazil and United Payments Interface (UPI) in India), increasing their position as an  alternativ e  to  payment  card  schemes.  T hese  networks  primarily  focus  on  domestic  transactions,  with  adoption  v arying  by  use  cases  and geographies. However, with linkages such as PayNow in Singapore and UPI in India, cross-border RTP networks are adv ancing and will compete with our cross-border business. RTP networks can compete with Visa on consumer payments and other payment flows (e.g., B2B and P2P) but can also be customers for v alue-added serv ices, such as risk management.\n\nDigital  Wallet  Providers: They  continue  to  expand  payment  capabilities  in  person  and  online  for  consumers  and  merchants  and  prov ide consumers with additional ways to pay. While digital wallets can help driv e Visa v olumes, they can also be funded by non-card payment options. Digital wallet prov iders who utilize RTP networks prov ide additional competition.\n\nPayment Processors: Payment processors may perform processing services on third-party payments networks on behalf of issuers or acquirers . We compete with payment processors for the processing of Visa transactions. These processors may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation. For example, as a result of regulation in Europe under the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR), we may face competition from other networks, processors and other third parties who could process Visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.\n\nNew Flows Providers: We compete with alternativ e solutions to our new flows (e.g., Visa Direct and Visa B2B Connect) such as ACH, RTP and wires.  We  compete  with  other  global  and  local  card  networks  for  commercial  card  portfolios. Additionally,  we  may  face  competition  from  financial institution clients who are experimenting with B2B blockchain payments.",

      "answer": "AXP reported 3,000 Other Loans accounts in 2020, which grew to 4,000 accounts in 2021, reflecting a 33% increase. This growth was accompanied by an average interest rate reduction of 3 percentage points in AXP's Other Loans segment, indicating a strategy to expand account base with more favorable terms. Meanwhile, COF reported $356 million in interest income from Other Loans in 2021, all of which was attributable to rate changes rather than volume, suggesting COF focused on optimizing pricing rather than expanding account volume in this category.",

      "question": "How did the 3% decline in JPMorgan's average deposits in 2023 compare to Bank of America's $53.0 billion decrease in average deposits, and what impact did these trends have on their respective wealth management segments given the shift toward higher-yielding investment alternatives?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan reported a 3% decline in average deposits in 2023, while Bank of America saw a more significant $53.0 billion drop in average deposits over the same period, primarily driven by clients reallocating funds to higher-yielding investment cash alternatives on their brokerage platforms. At Bank of America, this shift contributed to a $319 million decrease in net interest income for GWIM, as lower average deposit balances outweighed the benefits of higher-yielding deposit products. Although JPMorgan does not directly break out the wealth management segment's deposit performance, the decline in average deposits likely affected its Global Investment Banking and Wealth Management businesses similarly, particularly given the broader industry trend of clients favoring investment platforms over traditional deposits.",

      "answer": "Widening credit spreads could harm MetLife's investment portfolio by increasing impairments and reducing fair value of fixed income securities, as MetLife explicitly states that credit spread changes may harm its earnings. AWM, which holds debt securities and hedges retained loan portfolios, is exposed to adverse movements in credit spreads, as noted in JPMorgan's 10-K. Since Goldman Sachs reported $10.60 billion in investment management revenues in 2024\u2014driven by higher assets under supervision\u2014and includes AWM-related activities in its revenue mix, any negative performance in AWM's credit-sensitive investments could reduce GS's management fees and overall investment management revenue.",

Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures or other securities.\n\n## Our Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\n\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. MetLife, Inc. may also not meet its free cash flow or shareholder cash distribution goals.\n\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required if they determine payments could be adverse to our  policyholders  or  contractholders.  Business  conditions,  rating  agency  considerations,  tax ation,  dividend  and  repatriation  rules,  and  monetary  transfer  and  foreign currency exchange rules may limit our insurance subsidiaries' dividends and other payments. We may need to transfer capital among our companies to comply with net worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\n\n## Investment Risks\n\n## We May Face Defaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events That Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold\n\nIn case of a major economic downturn, U.S. government default (or threatened default), acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events, our estimated fair value of our fix ed income securities and loan portfolios and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default rate of our investment portfolio may increase. These changes could harm the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels if securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fix ed income securities may increase our write-downs or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\n\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property type may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the prices we can obtain when we sell assets, and our results of operations or financial condition. Legislation or regulations that would allow or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans or other investments could harm our investment portfolio.\n\nMajor public health issues have affected and may continue to affect financial markets and our investment portfolio. These may continue to contribute to our risk of investment defaults, downgrades and volatility, asset impairments and lower variable investment income and returns, and may cause or exacerbate any of the investment risks we describe in these risk factors.\n\nMarket volatility affects the value of or return on our investments. It may slow or prevent us from reacting to market events as effectively as we otherwise could. When we sell our investment holdings, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value, due to reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption, or other reasons. Borrowers may delay or fail to pay principal and interest when due, or may demand loan modifications. Tenants may delay paying rent, or fail to pay it, or demand lease modifications. We may face moratoriums on foreclosures and other enforcement actions, impairments, and loan or lease modifications, due to government action or market conditions. We may also encounter credit spread changes, increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our product fee income. Issuer or guarantor default rates may increase.\n\n## We May Have Difficulty Selling Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner to Realize Their Full Value\n\nWhen we sell holdings in our investment portfolio, we may not receive the price we seek and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value. We may face unfavorable conditions in privately-placed fixed income securities, private structured credit, certain derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, direct financing and leveraged leases, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, private equity, and real estate equity, including real estate joint ventures and funds. Our investments may suffer reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption or for other reasons. In addition, central banks' efforts to provide market liquidity or otherwise address market conditions may not be successful or sufficient. We may realize losses that harm our financial metrics, which could harm our compliance with our credit requirements and rating agency capital adequacy measures.",

AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n- Market making consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from client execution activities related to making markets in interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies, commodities and equity products. These activities are included in Global Banking &amp; Markets.\n- Other principal transactions consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from  our  equity  investing  activities,  including  revenues  related  to  our consolidated  investments  (included  in  Asset  &amp;  Wealth  Management), and  debt  investing  and  lending  activities  (included  across  our  three segments).\n\nOperating  Environment. During  2024,  the  operating  environment  was generally  characterized  by  continued  broad  macroeconomic  concerns, including  concerns  and  uncertainty  about  inflation,  ongoing  geopolitical tensions, central bank  policy and the potential outcome  of  national elections.  In  investment  banking,  industry-wide  underwriting  volumes increased compared with 2023, driven by strong levels of debt offerings and  improved  levels  of  equity  offerings,  while  industry-wide  completed mergers and acquisitions volumes remained below historical averages.  In market  making,  activity  levels  were  mixed,  as  activity  levels  in  fixed income-related  products  decreased  compared  with  the  prior  year,  while activity  levels  in  equity-related  products  increased.  Global  equity  prices were generally higher compared with the end of 2023, and concerns about the  commercial  real  estate  market  persisted.  In  the  U.S.,  the  rate  of unemployment  remained  low  and  the  pace  of  growth  in  consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2023.\n\nIf  uncertainty and concerns about geopolitical tensions and the economic outlook  remain  elevated  or  grow,  including  those  about  central  bank policy,  inflation  and  the  commercial  real  estate  sector,  it  may  lead  to  a decline in asset prices, a decline in market-making activity levels, a decline in  industry-wide  investment  banking  volumes,  and  net  revenues  and provision  for  credit  losses  would  likely  be  negatively  impacted.  See 'Segment Assets  and  Operating  Results  -  Segment  Operating  Results' for  information  about  the  operating  environment  and  material  trends  and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.\n\n## 2024 versus 2023\n\nNet  revenues  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  were  $53.51 billion  for  2024,  16%  higher  than  2023,  primarily  reflecting  significantly higher  other  principal  transactions  revenues,  net  interest  income  and investment banking revenues and higher investment management revenues.\n\nNon-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated  statements  of  earnings  were  $7.74  billion  for  2024,  24% higher than 2023, primarily reflecting significantly higher revenues in debt underwriting, primarily driven by leveraged finance activity, and in equity underwriting, primarily driven by secondary and initial public offerings. In addition,  revenues  in  advisory  were  higher,  reflecting  an  increase  in completed mergers and acquisitions transactions.\n\nInvestment management  revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings  were  $10.60  billion  for  2024,  11%  higher  than  2023,  primarily due to higher management and other fees, primarily reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision (AUS).\n\nCommissions  and  fees  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings  were $4.09 billion  for  2024,  8%  higher  than  2023,  due  to  higher  commissions and  fees  in  Equities,  reflecting  generally  higher  market  volumes  and increased transaction fees, partially offset by a loss related to the planned transition of the GM credit card program to another issuer.\n\nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $18.39  billion  for  2024,  essentially  unchanged  compared  with  2023. Market  making  revenues  from  intermediation activities were  slightly higher,  primarily  reflecting  significantly  higher  revenues  in  equity  cash products, currencies and mortgages, offset by significantly lower revenues in commodities and equity derivatives. Market making revenues from financing activities were essentially unchanged, reflecting significantly  lower  revenues  in  FICC  financing,  offset  by  significantly higher revenues from Equities financing.\n\nOther  principal  transactions  revenues  in  the  consolidated  statements  of earnings  were  $4.65  billion  for  2024,  119%  higher  than  2023,  primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from  investments in private equities,  significantly  higher  net  gains  from  derivatives  related  to  our funding  activities,  the  impact  of  the  sale  of  the  Marcus  loan  portfolio  in 2023 (including net revenues of approximately $(370) million related to the sale of substantially all of the portfolio) and significantly lower net losses on hedges related to our relationship lending portfolio.",

Meanwhile, MS had a revolving credit exposure of $108 million to borrowers with FICO scores \u2265740 as of December 31, 2023.

      "answer": "AXP reported an average payment term extension of 26 months for troubled card member receivables, while PYPL reported a weighted average payment term extension of 36 months for loans with extensions in 2021. This indicates that PYPL extended payment terms significantly longer than AXP, suggesting differing approaches to credit risk management, with PYPL potentially accommodating financially distressed borrowers for longer periods.",
