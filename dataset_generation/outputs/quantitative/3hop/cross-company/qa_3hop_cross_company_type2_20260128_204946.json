      "answer": "AMZN highlights that online sales positively impact its business, though the specific growth rate is not disclosed. HD reports a 6.6% increase in online sales, which contributed meaningfully to its $6.8 billion overall sales growth. In contrast, NKE experienced an 8% decline in digital sales, which offset gains from store expansion and comparable store sales. This contrast reveals that while AMZN and HD are seeing momentum in their digital channels, NKE is facing challenges in its online strategy, suggesting divergent digital growth paths across these consumer discretionary leaders.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\nNet Sales. Fiscal 2024 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2023. Net sales for fiscal 2024 increased $6.8 billion, or 4.5%, to $159.5 billion. T he increase in net sales for fiscal 2024 was primarily driv en by SRS, which contributed $6.4 billion of net sales during fiscal 2024, and incremental net sales of approximately $2.5 billion attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2024. This increase in net sales was partially offset by the impact of a negativ e comparable sales env ironment, primarily driv en by decreases in comparable customer transactions and comparable av erage ticket.\n\nOnline sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or deliv ered to customer locations, represented 15.1% of net sales and increased by 6.6% during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, including the online sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2024.\n\nA stronger U.S. dollar negativ ely impacted net sales by $298 million in fiscal 2024.\n\nComparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period ov er the comparable prior period of equiv alent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52 week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they hav e been owned for more than 52 weeks. Our comparable sales results for fiscal 2024 exclude the 53rd week and compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2024 to the 52-week period reported for fiscal 2023. The method of calculating comparable sales v aries across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. nd\n\nTotal comparable sales decreased 1.8% in fiscal 2024, reflecting a 1.0% decrease in comparable customer transactions and a 0.9% decrease in comparable average ticket compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in comparable customer transactions primarily reflects the impact of heightened macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including the impacts of a persisting high interest rate env ironment pressuring home improvement demand. The decrease in comparable av erage ticket primarily reflects price stabilization relativ e to last year, slightly offset by demand for new and innovativ e products.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, our Power and Building Materials merchandising departments posted positiv e comparable sales compared to fiscal 2023. All of our other merchandising departments posted negativ e comparable sales during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\n\n## Gross Profit\n\nGross profit increased $2.3 billion, or 4.6%, to $53.3 billion in fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.4% for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, and primarily reflected lower transportation costs and lower shrink within our Primary segment, offset by the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOur operating expenses are composed of SG&amp;A and depreciation and amortization.\n\nSelling, General &amp; Administrative. SG&amp;A increased $2.2 billion, or 8.1%, to $28.7 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, SG&amp;A was 18.0% in fiscal 2024 compared to 17.4% in fiscal 2023, which primarily reflects higher payroll costs, delev erage from a negativ e comparable sales env ironment and lower legal-related benefits.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $361 million, or 13.5%, to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.9% in fiscal 2024 compared to 1.8% in fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense of $239 million, of which $218 million was related to SRS, as well as increased depreciation expense from ongoing inv estments in the business.\n\n## Interest and Other, net\n\nInterest and other, net increased $355 million, or 20.1%, to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, interest and other, net, was 1.3% in fiscal 2024 compared to 1.2% in fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher interest expense driv en by higher long-term debt.\n\n## Provision for Income Taxes\n\nOur combined effectiv e income tax rate was 23.7% in fiscal 2024 compared to 24.0% in fiscal 2023.",

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking  statements  represent  our  current  judgment  about  possible  future  events  and  are  often  identified  by  words  like 'aim,'  'anticipate,'  'appears,'  'approximately,'  'believe,'  'continue,'  'could,'  'designed,'  'effect,'  'estimate,'  'evaluate,' 'expect,'  'forecast,'  'goal,'  'initiative,'  'intend,'  'may,'  'objective,'  'outlook,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'priorities,'  'project,' 'pursue,'  'seek,'  'should,'  'target,'  'when,'  'will,'  'would,'  or  the  negative  of  any  of  those  words  or  similar  expressions.  In making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these  judgments  are  reasonable,  but  these  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  any  future  events  or  financial  results,  and  our  actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may be  revised  or  supplemented  in  subsequent  reports  we  file  with  the  SEC,  include,  among  others,  the  following:  (1)  our  ability  to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption; (4) the success of our current line of full-size SUVs and full-size pickup trucks; (5) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of  incentives,  and  the  introduction  of  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  by  our  competitors;  (6)  the  unique  technological, operational,  regulatory  and  competitive  risks  related  to  the  timing  and  commercialization  of  autonomous  vehicles;  (7)  risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the  potential  increased  impacts  of  severe  weather  events;  (8)  global  automobile  market  sales  volume,  which  can  be  volatile;  (9) prices  and  uncertain  availability  of  raw  materials  and  commodities  used  by  us  and  our  suppliers,  and  instability  in  logistics  and related costs; (10) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (11) the success of our ongoing strategic business relationships and of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (12) the international scale and footprint of our operations, which exposes us to a variety of unique  political,  economic,  competitive  and  regulatory  risks,  including  the  risk  of  changes  in  government  leadership  and  laws (including  labor,  trade,  tax  and  other  laws),  political  uncertainty  or  instability  and  economic  tensions  between  governments  and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, changes in foreign  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates,  economic  downturns  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  differing  local  product preferences and product requirements, changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions,  differing  labor  regulations,  requirements  and  union  relationships,  differing  dealer  and  franchise  regulations  and relationships,  difficulties  in  obtaining  financing  in  foreign  countries,  and  public  health  crises,  including  the  occurrence  of  a contagious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; (13) any significant disruption, including any work stoppages, at any of our manufacturing facilities; (14) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (15) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; (16) the success of any restructurings or  other  cost  reduction  actions;  (17)  the  possibility  that  competitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to ours, or that our intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitors from developing or selling those products or services; (18) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles and in-vehicle systems; (19) our ability to comply with increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations relating to our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal  Identifiable  Information  of  our  customers,  employees,  or  suppliers;  (20)  our  ability  to  comply  with  extensive  laws, regulations  and  policies  applicable  to  our  operations  and  products,  including  those  relating  to  fuel  economy,  emissions  and autonomous vehicles; (21) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (22) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (23) any additional tax expense or exposure; (24) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; and (25) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements. For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *",

          "chunk_text": "Investments - Investments generally consist of agency securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, governmental securities, and money market funds, which are classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\nThe proceeds from sales of available-for-sale debt securities were $308 million, $42 million, and $121 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  Gross realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities were not significant for any of the periods presented.\n\nInvestments with a stated maturity date of one year or less from the balance sheet date or that are expected to be used in current operations are classified as short-term investments.  All other investments are classified as long-term. Investments classified as longterm at January 28, 2022, will mature in one to three years, based on stated maturity dates.\n\nThe Company classifies as investments restricted balances primarily pledged as collateral for the Company's extended protection plan program. Restricted balances included in short-term investments were $271 million at January 28, 2022, and $506 million at January 29, 2021.  Restricted balances included in long-term investments were $199 million at January 28, 2022, and $200 million at January 29, 2021.\n\nMerchandise Inventory - The majority of the Company's inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method of inventory accounting. Inventory for certain subsidiaries representing approximately 7% of the consolidated inventory balances as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value using the weighted average cost method. The cost of inventory includes certain costs associated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor funds.\n\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  This reserve is based on management's current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and historical experience. Management does not believe the Company's merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and management has the ability to adjust purchasing patterns based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.  However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.  The Company also records an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  Changes in the estimated shrink reserve are made based on the timing and results of physical inventories.\n\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments, or promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor's product.  Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold.  Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.  The Company develops accrual rates for vendor funds based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs analyses and reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments - The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and the prices of commodities used in the normal course of business. The Company occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage certain business risks. All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company held forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates on forecasted debt issuances as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021. The cash flows related to forward interest rate swap agreements are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges, thus the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the underlying hedged transaction impacts the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nThe Company held fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt as of January 28, 2022. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the fair value hedges using the shortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective. Thus, the change in fair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in",

          "chunk_text": "## If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting estimates prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets, hedge accounting for derivatives, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock.\n\n## Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock.\n\nThere are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company.\n\n## We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\n\nOur Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts' opinions of our future performance, which may, in part, be based upon any guidance we have provided. Analysts' estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in reputational damage, substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources needed to successfully run our business.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 23",

      "question": "How do Home Depot (HD), Starbucks (SBUX), and Tesla (TSLA) each address the impact of logistics costs on their respective business strategies, and what does this reveal about their operational priorities and sensitivities in 2023?",
      "answer": "Home Depot (HD) notes that logistics and supply chain disruptions have resulted in increased costs, delivery delays, and inventory shortages, particularly due to port congestion and labor shortages. Starbucks (SBUX) highlights that adverse weather, natural disasters, and rising logistics costs pose a potential negative impact on its supply chain and operational efficiency. Tesla (TSLA), in contrast, emphasizes its success in lowering logistics costs through production innovation and localized procurement, which supports vehicle affordability and competitive pricing. This reveals that HD and SBUX are more exposed to and concerned about rising logistics costs, while Tesla is actively reducing them as part of its cost-cutting strategy.",

        "Hop 1: HD \u2192 Logistics Costs: HD reports that logistics disruptions, including port delays and labor shortages, have increased supply chain costs and affected inventory availability.",

In contrast, Nike reported that while product input costs increased, these were offset by lower ocean freight and logistics costs, contributing to gross margin expansion. Tesla acknowledged that inflation in raw material costs posed a challenge, particularly in scaling production and maintaining cost efficiency across its global manufacturing operations. Together, these disclosures suggest varying degrees of exposure and strategic responses to raw material cost pressures across the consumer discretionary sector.",

The decrease in total sales was primarily driven by the decrease in comparable sales. Comparable sales decreased 2.7% over the same period, driven by a 3.0% decline in comparable customer transactions, and a 0.3% increase in comparable average ticket. Comparable sales change during each quarter of the fiscal year, as reported, were declines of 4.1% in the first quarter, 5.1% in the second quarter, 1.1% in the third quarter, and an increase of 0.2% in the fourth quarter.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, we had comparable sales increases in Building Materials. An additional four product categories performed above the Company average, including Hardware, Rough Plumbing, Appliances, and Millwork. Strength in Building Materials reflects strong demand from Pro customers. Our DIY customer categories were impacted by lower DIY discretionary demand, particularly in bigger-ticket interior projects.\n\nGross Margin - Gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2024 decreased seven basis points compared to fiscal 2023. The gross margin decrease for the year was primarily driven by investments in our supply chain, partially offset by productivity initiatives.\n\nSG&amp;A - SG&amp;A expense for fiscal 2024 deleveraged 72 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2023. This was primarily driven by employee compensation and benefits, due to higher bonus attainment and employee insurance costs, as well as cycling favorable legal settlements in the prior year.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization expense deleveraged eight basis points for fiscal 2024 as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nInterest - Net - Net interest ex pense is comprised of the following:\n\n",

These valuations require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers' programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\n\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Accounts Receivable, Net and Other\n\nIncluded in 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, customer receivables, net, were $34.1 billion and $34.3 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $8.5 billion and $11.6 billion, and other receivables, net, were $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Prepaid ex penses and other current assets, which include amounts related to nonincome taxes and satellite network launch services deposits, were $5.4 billion and $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024. We currently expense satellite network launch services deposits upon launch to 'Technology and infrastructure.'\n\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.9 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Property and Equipment, Net\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, five years",

Costs associated with the acquisition and dev elopment of software are amortized using the straight-line method ov er the estimated useful life of the software, which ranges from three to sev en years. Certain dev elopment costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.\n\nWe evaluate our long-liv ed assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its prev iously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recov erable. The ev aluation for long-liv ed assets is performed at the lowest lev el of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the indiv idual store lev el. Long-liv ed assets with indicators of impairment are ev aluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying v alue. If the carrying v alue is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the asset group's fair v alue to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair v alue is less than the carrying v alue, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying v alue and the estimated fair v alue. Impairment losses on property and equipment are generally recorded as a component of SG&amp;A. Impairment charges for long-liv ed assets were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, or fiscal 2022.\n\n## Fiscal 2024 Form  10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and equivalents represent cash and short-term , highly liquid investm ents, that are both readily convertible to known am ounts of cash and so near their m aturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, with m aturities three m onths or less at the date of purchase.\n\n## SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS\n\nShort-term  investm ents consist of highly liquid investm ents with m aturities over three m onths at the date of purchase. At M ay 31, 2024 and 2023, Short-term  investm ents consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss), unless unrealized losses are determ ined to be unrecoverable. R ealized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determ ined by specific identification. T he C om pany considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with m aturity dates beyond 12 m onths, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with m aturity dates beyond three m onths at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term  investm ents on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nRefer to N ote 4 - Fair Value M easurem ents for m ore inform ation on the C om pany's Short-term  investm ents.\n\n## ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\n\nAccounts receivable, net consist prim arily of am ounts due from  custom ers. T he C om pany m akes ongoing estim ates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from  the inability of its custom ers to m ake required paym ents. In addition to judgm ents about the creditworthiness of significant custom ers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the C om pany considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as m acroeconom ic and industry trends to determ ine the am ount of the allowance. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $35 m illion as of M ay 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## INVENTORY VALUATION\n\nI nventories, substantially all of which are finished goods, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, the C om pany ships products directly from  its suppliers to the custom er, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. I nventory costs prim arily consist of product cost from  the C om pany's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, im port duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and other handling fees.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION\n\nProperty, plant and equipm ent are recorded at cost. D epreciation is determ ined on a straight-line basis for land im provem ents, buildings and leasehold im provem ents over 2 to 40 years and for m achinery and equipm ent over 2 to 15 years.\n\nDepreciation and am ortization of assets used in m anufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in C ost of sales. D epreciation and am ortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense.\n\n## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\n\nExpenditures for m ajor software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and am ortized over 2 to 12 years on a straight-line basis. T he C om pany's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use com puter software. T he C om pany also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for em ployees who are directly associated with internal use com puter software projects. T he am ount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is lim ited to the tim e directly spent on such projects. C osts associated with prelim inary project stage activities, training, m aintenance and all other post-im plem entation stage activities are expensed as incurred.\n\nDevelopm ent costs of com puter software to be sold, leased or otherwise m arketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to custom ers. In m ost instances, the C om pany's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established; therefore, software developm ent costs incurred subsequent to achievem ent of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally, m ost software developm ent costs have been expensed as incurred.",

      "question": "How do AMZN, NKE, and SBUX each approach the financial implications of their foreign subsidiaries, particularly in terms of reinvestment, translation exposure, and tax liabilities, and what does this reveal about their global capital management strategies?",
      "answer": "AMZN intends to reinvest substantially all foreign subsidiary earnings and capital indefinitely outside the U.S., citing significant additional costs upon repatriation. NKE experiences translational exposure due to foreign subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar functional currencies, with a $141 million detrimental impact on revenue and a $48 million benefit on pre-tax income in FY2024, and actively hedges these exposures using forward contracts and options. SBUX has approximately $2.6 billion in gross taxable temporary differences in foreign subsidiaries where it is partially indefinitely reinvested, resulting in up to $260 million in unrecognized tax liabilities. Together, these approaches show distinct global capital management strategies: AMZN focuses on deferral and repatriation costs, NKE emphasizes currency risk mitigation through hedging, and SBUX highlights long-term reinvestment with deferred tax implications.",

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U .S. D ollar. F luctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U .S. D ollars for consolidated reporting. T he translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. D ollar denom inated balance sheets into U .S. D ollars for consolidated reporting results in a cum ulative translation adjustm ent to Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e, a weaker U .S. D ollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The im pact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detrim ent of approxim ately $141 m illion for the year ended M ay 31, 2024. T he im pact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Incom e before incom e taxes was a benefit of approxim ately $48 m illion for the year ended M ay 31, 2024.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTo m inim ize the im pact of translating foreign currency denom inated revenues and expenses into U .S. D ollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U .S. D ollar denom inated available-for-sale investm ents. T he variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U .S. D ollar denom inated investm ents at non-U .S. D ollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U .S. G AAP . W e utilize forward contracts and/or options to m itigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U .S. D ollar investm ents. T he com bination of the purchase and sale of the U .S. D ollar investm ent and the hedging instrum ent has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation im pact on net earnings in the period the investm ents are sold. H edges of the purchase of U .S. D ollar denom inated available-for-sale investm ents are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nWe estim ate the com bination of translation of foreign currency-denom inated profits from  our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in O ther (incom e) expense, net had an unfavorable im pact of approxim ately $68 m illion on our Incom e before incom e taxes for the year ended M ay 31, 2024.\n\n## NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\n\nWe are also exposed to the im pact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investm ents in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denom inated in a currency other than the U .S. D ollar, which could adversely im pact the U .S. D ollar value of these investm ents and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. W e have, in the past, hedged and m ay, in the future, hedge net investm ent positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to m itigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investm ents. T hese hedges are accounted for as net investm ent hedges in accordance with U .S. G AAP . T here were no outstanding net investm ent hedges as of M ay 31, 2024 and 2023. There were no cash flows from  net investm ent hedge settlem ents for the years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## CASH FLOW ACTIVITY\n\nCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $7,429 m illion for fiscal 2024, com pared to $5,841 m illion for fiscal 2023. N et incom e, adjusted for non-cash item s, generated $6,713 m illion of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2024, com pared to $6,354 m illion for fiscal 2023. T he net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to C ash provided (used) by operations of $716 m illion for fiscal 2024 com pared to a decrease of $513 m illion for fiscal 2023. F or fiscal 2024, the favorable net change in working capital com pared to the prior year was prim arily im pacted by favorable changes to Inventories due to reduced inventory purchases and im proved lead tim es, partially offset by unfavorable changes to Accounts receivable due to the tim ing of wholesale shipm ents.\n\nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $894 m illion for fiscal 2024, com pared to an inflow of $564 m illion for fiscal 2023, prim arily driven by the net change in short-term  investm ents (including sales, m aturities and purchases).

TSLA, while not receiving incentives directly, is negatively impacted by the absence or disadvantage in accessing certain domestic manufacturing incentives that benefit competitors, potentially affecting its profitability and competitive positioning.

These valuations require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers' programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\n\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Accounts Receivable, Net and Other\n\nIncluded in 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, customer receivables, net, were $34.1 billion and $34.3 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $8.5 billion and $11.6 billion, and other receivables, net, were $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Prepaid ex penses and other current assets, which include amounts related to nonincome taxes and satellite network launch services deposits, were $5.4 billion and $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024. We currently expense satellite network launch services deposits upon launch to 'Technology and infrastructure.'\n\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.9 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Property and Equipment, Net\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, five years",

We account for government incentives as a reduction of expense, a reduction of the cost of the capital investment or other income based on the substance of the incentive received. The benefit from advanced manufacturing production credits are not accounted for or classified  as  an  income  tax   credit.  Benefits  are  generally  recorded  when  there  is  reasonable  assurance  of  receipt  or,  as  it  relates  to  advanced manufacturing production credits, upon the generation of the credit. Amounts are recorded in earnings as the expenses in which the incentive is meant to offset are incurred, as we meet the conditions of the grant or as the capital investment is depreciated or, as it relates to advanced manufacturing production credits, upon generation of the credit. At December 31, 2024, cash incentives receivable in Accounts and notes receivable, net of allowance was $343 million, cash incentives credited  to  Property,  net  were  $480  million,  cash  incentives  receivable  in  Other  assets  was  $292  million  and  deferred  incentive  income  in  Other  liabilities  was $212 million. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $524 million in Automotive and other cost of sales associated with incentives. Current agreements expire at various dates through 2032 and we consider the risk that any amounts recognized will be returned to be remote.\n\nEmissions Credits We periodically enter into agreements to purchase credits to facilitate our compliance with emission and fuel economy regulations. Purchased credits are recorded at cost in Other current assets and Other assets and are recognized in expense over the periods in which the acquired credits facilitate our compliance with emission and fuel economy regulations. In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we paid $2.0 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion to purchase credits to facilitate our compliance with regulations. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount of acquired credits were $2.1 billion and $1.0 billion. Compliance-related costs of $1.0 billion, $0.7 billion and $0.5 billion were recorded in Automotive and other costs of sales in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Pension and OPEB Plans\n\nAttribution, Methods and Assumptions The cost of benefits provided by defined benefit pension plans is recorded in the period employees provide service. The cost of pension plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the duration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement specific to the plan, the ex pected future working lifetime or the life ex pectancy of the plan participants.\n\nThe cost of medical, dental, legal service and life insurance benefits provided through postretirement benefit plans is recorded in the period employees provide service. The cost of postretirement plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the average period to full eligibility or the average life ex pectancy of the plan participants.\n\nAn expected return on plan asset methodology is utilized to calculate future pension expense for certain significant funded benefit plans. A market-related value of plan  assets  methodology  is  also  utilized  that  averages  gains  and  losses  on  the  plan  assets  over  a  period  of  years  to  determine  future  pension  ex pense.  The methodology recognizes 60% of the difference between the fair value of assets and the expected calculated value in the first year and 10% of that difference over each of the next four years.\n\nThe discount rate assumption is established for each of the retirement-related benefit plans at their respective measurement dates. In the U.S., we use a cash flow matching approach that uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high-quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate. We apply individual annual yield curve rates to determine the service cost and interest cost for our pension and OPEB plans to more specifically link the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.\n\nThe benefit obligation for pension plans in Canada, the United Kingdom (UK) and G ermany represents 89% of the non-U.S. pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2024. The discount rates for plans in Canada, the UK and Germany are determined using a cash flow matching approach like the U.S.\n\nPlan Asset Valuation Due to the lack of timely available market information for certain investments in the asset classes described below as well as the inherent uncertainty of valuation, reported fair values may differ from fair values that would have been used had timely available market information been available.\n\nCash Equivalents and Other Short-Term Investments Cash equivalents, including reverse repurchase agreements, trade deposits and other short-term investments, are valued based on pricing received from independent pricing services, dealers who",

The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such costs through increased prices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth, prospects and operating results.\n\n## Our future growth and success are dependent upon consumers' demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.\n\nThough we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\nIn addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as:\n\n- perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\n- perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities;\n- competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles;\n- volatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;\n- government regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and\n- concerns about our future viability.\n\nThe target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility. We also cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact on consumer demand. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. Rising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and operating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\n## We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\n\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles ex clusively at some point in the future. In addition, certain government and economic incentives which provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically or have local suppliers, may provide a greater benefit to our competitors, which could negatively impact our profitability. Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.",

      "question": "How do Amazon, Home Depot, and Lowe\u2019s each quantify or describe the financial impact of interchange fees on their respective operating models, and what does this reveal about their payment processing cost structures?",
      "answer": "Amazon notes that interchange and other fees associated with credit and debit card transactions may increase over time, raising operating costs and lowering profitability. Home Depot includes interchange fees as part of net sales, indicating they are a recurring cost tied to their private label credit card (PLCC) program and third-party payment processing agreements. Lowe\u2019s highlights that interchange fees raise operating costs and notes the risk of further increases, which could impact profitability. Comparing these perspectives, Amazon and Lowe\u2019s emphasize interchange fees as a cost risk to profitability, while Home Depot integrates these fees into its broader PLCC financial model, suggesting a more structured cost absorption approach.",

C entral banks deploy various strategies to com bat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which im pact our borrowing costs. G overnm ent shutdowns or the risk of governm ent shutdowns, as well as the im pact or expected im pact of elections, both in the U nited States and in other countries around the world, m ay also increase volatility. Additionally, there has been, and m ay continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates that im pact the U .S. D ollar value relative to other international currencies. O ur international revenues and expenses generally are derived from  sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations, specifically am ounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U .S. D ollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U .S. D ollar adversely affects the U .S. D ollar value of the C om pany's foreign currency-denom inated sales and earnings. C urrency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent m anufacturers that produce our products by m aking their purchases of raw m aterials m ore expensive and m ore difficult to finance. F oreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to com pletely elim inate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative im pact of a stronger U .S. D ollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive im pact of a weaker U .S. D ollar or other trading currency. O ur future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected by the value of the U .S. D ollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given tim e period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale customers.\n\nWe extend credit to our custom ers based on an assessm ent of a custom er's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. T o assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain custom ers the opportunity to place orders five to six m onths ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program . T hese advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with econom ic uncertainty. In the past, som e custom ers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. W hen the retail econom y weakens or as consum er behavior shifts, retailers tend to be m ore cautious with orders. A slowing or changing econom y in our key m arkets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our custom ers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. I n addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality m erchandising and an appealing retail environm ent to attract consum ers, which requires continuing investm ents by retailers. R etailers that experience financial difficulties m ay fail to m ake such investm ents or delay them , resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.\n\n## Climate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nThere are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atm osphere have caused, and m ay continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate, increases in global tem peratures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extrem e weather and clim ate events. C lim ate change m ay also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw m aterials, including those used in the production of our products, and m ay result in changes in regulations or consum er preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. F or exam ple, there has been increased focus by governm ental and nongovernm ental organizations, consum ers, custom ers, em ployees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably m ade and other sustainability m atters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and m aterials transparency, any of which m ay require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local governm ental authorities in various countries are im plem enting, have proposed and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or m itigate the im pacts of clim ate change on the environm ent. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of clim ate change, which could increase the com plexity of, and potential cost related to com plying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing m ay require us to m ake additional investm ents in facilities and equipm ent, m ay im pact the availability and cost of key raw m aterials used in the production of our products or the dem and for our products, and, in turn, m ay adversely im pact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nI nvestors, regulators and other stakeholders are also increasingly scrutinizing com panies' environm ental, social and governance ('E SG ') com m itm ents, perform ance and disclosures, including related to clim ate change, and in recent years have placed increasing im portance on social costs and related im plications of their investm ents.

The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business.\n\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution, or sale of some of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of ingredients contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a progressive tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage, and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, in the Netherlands, a consumption tax is applicable on cold non-alcoholic beverages (non-milk based) at a flat tax rate of 26.13 Euro per 100 Liters. In addition to the tax es on the beverages (or components thereof), we also notice a regional increase in the adoption of environmentally focused taxes, including, for ex ample, plastic packaging tax  to encourage companies to increase usage of sustainable packaging options.\n\nThese tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have adversely impacted, and could continue to impact our business and financial performance by increasing the cost of certain of our products, reducing overall consumption of our products, or leading to negative publicity.\n\nFinally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has released guidance establishing a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis for multinational entities under Pillar Two of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative. As of September 29, 2024, certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation to adopt Pillar Two effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023, and other countries in which we operate are expected to introduce similar legislation to implement Pillar Two. This global minimum tax will not be effective for the Company until fiscal 2025, and it is not ex pected to result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to monitor regulatory developments with respect to this initiative for potential impacts.\n\nThe complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance, and restatements of our financial statements, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\n## We have been, and could continue to be, party to litigation or other legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business, results, operations, and reputation.\n\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business. These legal proceedings may involve claims brought by store partners, customers, government agencies, suppliers, shareholders, or others through private actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation, including litigation on a class or collective basis on behalf of what can be a large group of potential claimants. These legal proceedings have involved, and in the future may involve, allegations of illegal, unfair, or inconsistent employment practices, including those governing wage and hour, employment of minors, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, and vacation and family leave laws; food-safety issues including food-borne illness, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of our food products; data security or privacy breaches; customer discrimination; personal injury in our stores; marketing and advertising claims, including claims that our environmental and social program claims are misleading or inaccurate; infringement of patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights; violation of the federal securities laws; workers' compensation; or other concerns. We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and governmental audits alleging violations of federal and state employment laws, including wage and hour claims, and we could be involved in similar or even more significant litigation and legal proceedings in the future. Even if the allegations against us in current or future legal matters are unfounded or we ultimately are held not liable, the costs to defend ourselves may be significant, and the litigation may subject us to substantial settlements, fines, penalties, or judgments against us and may divert management's attention away from operating our business, all of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Litigation also may generate negative publicity, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are not liable, which could damage our reputation and adversely impact our sales as well as our relationships with our store partners and customers. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.",

No stock options were granted to the executive officers of the Company. Stock options granted or assumed in acquisitions generally have a term of 10 years from the grant date. The fair value of stock options granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The use of an option pricing model requires the use of several assumptions including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected term. Expected volatility is based on the Company's historical volatility over the expected term of the option and implied volatility of publicly traded options of the Company's common stock. The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until option exercise. Since the Company has limited historical stock option exercise experience, the Company used the simplified method in estimating the expected term, which is calculated as the average of the sum of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues at the time of grant for the expected term of the option.\n\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used to value options granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 using the Black-Scholes options pricing model:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "the 2020 ESPP began December 1, 2020, following the expiration of the Lowe's Companies Employee Stock Purchase Plan - Stock Options for Everyone (the Former ESPP). From its adoption to expiration on November 30, 2020, there were 50.5 million of the 70.0 million authorized shares issued under the Former ESPP. The first offering period under the 2020 ESPP ended May 31, 2021, with the automatic exercise of options occurring the same day. As of January 28, 2022, there were 19.4 million shares remaining available for purchases.\n\nThe Company recognized share-based payment expense within SG&amp;A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings of $230 million, $155 million, and $98 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  The total associated income tax benefit recognized, exclusive of excess tax benefits, was $40 million, $29 million, and $15 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\nTotal unrecognized share-based payment expense for all share-based payment plans was $299 million at January 28, 2022, of which $186 million will be recognized in 2022, $97 million in 2023, and $16 million thereafter.  This results in these amounts being recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.\n\nFor all share-based payment awards, the expense recognized has been adjusted for estimated forfeitures where the requisite service is not expected to be met.  Estimated forfeiture rates are developed based on the Company's analysis of historical forfeiture data for homogeneous employee groups.\n\nGeneral terms and methods of valuation for the Company's share-based awards are as follows:\n\n## Stock Options\n\nStock options have terms of 10 years, with one-third of each grant vesting each year for three years, subsequent to the date of the grant, and are assigned an exercise price equal to the closing market price of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Options are expensed on a straight-line basis over the grant vesting period, which is considered to be the requisite service period.\n\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  When determining expected volatility, the Company considers the historical volatility of the Company's stock price, as well as implied volatility.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options' expected term.  The expected term of the options is based on the Company's evaluation of option holders' exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options are expected to remain unexercised.  The Company uses historical data to estimate the timing and amount of forfeitures.  The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and weightedaverage grant date fair value for options granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe adopted ASC 842, Leases, as of January 1, 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach ('adoption of the new lease standard'). In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed us to carry forward the historical determination of contracts as leases, lease classification and not reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements. The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs\n\nMarketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Marketing, promotional and advertising costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income ('GILTI') earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance.\n\n## Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nComprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on marketable securities that have been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.",

Lowe's also consolidates its wholly-owned or controlled subsidiaries, emphasizing their role in supporting the company's position as the second-largest home improvement retailer with 1,971 stores in the U.S. and Canada. Tesla leverages its wholly-owned subsidiaries in a more financial and structured manner, using them to facilitate lease pass-through fund arrangements that finance solar energy systems through master leases with investors. While Home Depot and Lowe's use subsidiaries operationally to support retail infrastructure, Tesla uses them to enable capital-efficient financing structures for renewable energy deployment.

Below are those accounting policies considered by the Company to be significant.\n\nFiscal Year The Company's fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest the end of January.  Each of the fiscal years presented contained 52 weeks. All references herein for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 represent the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022, January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned or controlled operating subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nImpacts of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions were put in place in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. At the onset of the pandemic, the Company implemented a number of measures to facilitate a safer store environment and to provide support for its associates, customers and community. Beginning in fiscal 2020, the Company expanded associate benefits in response to COVID-19 to provide additional paid time off, special payments to hourly associates, temporary wage increases and other benefits, which continued through 2021. The Company also continued enhanced cleaning protocols. These actions resulted in $162 million and $1.2 billion of expense included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), which was enacted on March 27, 2020, included measures to assist companies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company deferred the payments of qualifying employer payroll taxes which were required to be paid over two years, with half due by December 31, 2021, and the other half due by December 31, 2022. These amounts are included in cash flows from other operating liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table presents the qualifying employer payroll taxes deferred in accordance with the CARES Act along with the location in the consolidated balance sheets:\n\n",

Under these arrangements, our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors through arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years. These solar energy systems are subject to lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25 years.\n\nUnder a lease pass-through fund arrangement, the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor, which is one of our subsidiaries, and in some cases, subsequent periodic payments. As of December 31, 2021, the future minimum master lease payments to be received from investors, for each of the next five years and thereafter, were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How do BKNG, HD, and LOW each disclose their current operating lease liabilities, and what does this reveal about their short-term lease obligations and financial strategies in 2022?",
      "answer": "BKNG reported $143 million in current operating lease liabilities in 2022, reflecting a relatively small short-term lease burden. HD disclosed $830 million in current operating lease liabilities, indicating a significantly larger near-term lease obligation. LOW reported $636 million in current operating lease liabilities, showing a moderate level of short-term lease exposure. These differences suggest varying degrees of reliance on leased assets for operations, with HD having the highest short-term lease liability among the three, followed by LOW and then BKNG.",

      "answer": "BKNG reports total future operating lease payments of $890 million, MCD discloses $17.4 billion, and TSLA states $5.36 billion in future minimum lease payments under operating leases. These figures indicate differing approaches to asset-light strategies, with MCD maintaining the largest lease footprint, likely tied to its global store network, while BKNG shows a much smaller lease obligation, consistent with its asset-light digital platform model. TSLA\u2019s intermediate level reflects its hybrid approach, balancing owned manufacturing with leased retail and service locations.",

      "question": "How do AMZN, BKNG, and HD each disclose or manage their exposure to interchange fees, and what does this reveal about their differing operational dependencies on payment processing ecosystems?",
      "answer": "AMZN discloses that interchange fees are a growing cost factor in their payment operations, particularly for credit and debit card transactions, and notes that potential increases in these fees could lower profitability. BKNG pays interchange fees as part of its payment processing activities and highlights the risk of increased fees harming profit margins, especially as it scales its global payment systems. HD includes interchange fees as part of its net sales calculations under its private label credit card (PLCC) program, indicating a more embedded and structured cost model tied to customer financing programs. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to interchange fees, AMZN emphasizes regulatory and cost risk, BKNG focuses on scalability and margin impact, and HD integrates the fees into a broader consumer financing strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Interchange Fees: Discloses interchange and other fees on credit/debit card transactions and warns of potential increases impacting profitability.",
        "Hop 2: BKNG \u2192 Interchange Fees: Pays interchange fees as part of payment processing and notes the risk of margin compression if fees rise or relationships with processors change.",
        "Hop 3: HD \u2192 Interchange Fees: Includes interchange fees in net sales under its PLCC program, showing a structured and integrated cost model tied to customer financing."

For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  consolidated diluted  EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares  outstanding-diluted.  Examples  of  income  tax  adjustments  include  the  establishment  or  reversal  of  significant  deferred  tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our  core  operations  on  a  consistent  basis.  ETR-adjusted  is  calculated  as  Income  tax  expense  less  the  income  tax  related  to  the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before  income  taxes  less  adjustments. When  we  provide  an  expected  adjusted  effective  tax  rate,  we  do  not  provide  an  expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  investment  and  capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review  the  liquidity  of  our  automotive  operations  and  to  measure  and  monitor  our  performance  against  our  capital  allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted  automotive  free  cash  flow  as  automotive  operating  cash  flow  from  operations  less  capital  expenditures  adjusted  for management actions.  Management  actions  can  include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

At the end of fiscal 2021, a total of 311 of our stores, or 13.4%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $604.74 in fiscal 2021. Our inventory turnover ratio was 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 5.8 times at the end of fiscal 2020. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment.\n\nWe generated $16.6 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt during fiscal 2021. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $14.8 billion for share repurchases, pay $7.0 billion of dividends, fund $2.6 billion in capital expenditures, and repay an aggregate of $1.5 billion of long-term debt. In February 2022, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.90 per share.\n\nOur ROIC was 44.7% for fiscal 2021 and 40.8% for fiscal 2020.

      "answer": "Home Depot includes fixed real estate taxes in the measurement of lease liabilities when they are part of the lease agreement, while variable real estate taxes are excluded and recognized in the period incurred. Lowe's reports that real estate taxes and common-area maintenance represent the majority of its variable lease costs, which are excluded from the present value of lease obligations. Starbucks includes fixed common-area maintenance and real estate taxes in its lease cost calculations, recognizing them on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable costs based on sales are recognized only when probable and not included in lease liabilities. This reveals that HD and SBUX take a more structured, long-term approach to lease cost recognition, while LOW emphasizes the variable nature of its real estate tax obligations.",

        "Hop 1: HD \u2192 Real Estate Taxes: HD states that fixed real estate taxes are included in lease liabilities when determinable, while variable taxes are recognized as incurred and not included in lease liabilities.",

      "question": "How do HD, SBUX, and TSLA each characterize their use of finance lease assets, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to capital deployment and asset financing in 2024?",
      "answer": "HD reports $2,638 million in finance lease assets as of February 2, 2025, indicating a notable reliance on financed assets, likely tied to its real estate or equipment. SBUX states that its finance lease assets were not material as of September 29, 2024, suggesting minimal use of this form of financing, consistent with its broader asset-light store model. TSLA discloses that it added $144 million in leased assets through finance leases in 2024, reflecting a small but growing use of finance leases, potentially for specialized manufacturing equipment or vehicles. Together, these disclosures show HD maintaining a traditional, asset-heavy approach with significant finance leases, SBUX avoiding such commitments in favor of operational flexibility, and TSLA selectively using finance leases to support its capital-intensive growth.",

      "answer": "GM defines EBIT-adjusted as a key performance metric that excludes items such as impairment charges, legal costs, and certain tax adjustments, allowing for a clearer view of core operations. NKE explicitly states that EBIT is the primary financial measure used to evaluate performance, with corporate costs excluded from its calculation. SBux reports EBIT as 'Earnings before income taxes' at $4,969.6 million in FY2024, reflecting operating income adjusted for interest income and expense. The differences in how each company defines and applies EBIT reveal varying degrees of adjustment for non-operational or one-time items, with GM taking the most customized approach to EBIT, NKE using it in a more standard operational context, and SBUX reporting it as a straightforward pre-tax earnings figure.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "question": "How do AMZN, BKNG, and SBUX each account for operating lease costs, and what does this reveal about their respective exposure and treatment of off-balance sheet obligations?",
      "answer": "AMZN categorizes leases with terms over 12 months as either operating or finance leases and recognizes operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. BKNG similarly accounts for operating lease costs, combining fixed lease and non-lease payments, and recognizes them on a straight-line basis, while using its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease liabilities. SBUX discloses concrete figures for operating lease costs, reporting $1,723.5 million in fiscal year 2024, $1,601.0 million in 2023, and $1,554.8 million in 2022, showing a consistent upward trend. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies recognize operating lease costs as significant ongoing expenses, AMZN and BKNG emphasize accounting methodology and discounting practices, whereas SBUX provides concrete historical figures that quantify the growing magnitude of these obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Operating Lease Costs: AMZN categorizes leases and recognizes operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with no mention of specific dollar figures but detailed methodology.",
        "Hop 2: BKNG \u2192 Operating Lease Costs: BKNG combines fixed lease and non-lease payments and uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease liabilities, focusing on the financial modeling of lease obligations.",
        "Hop 3: SBUX \u2192 Operating Lease Costs: SBUX provides specific dollar amounts for operating lease costs across three fiscal years, showing a clear upward trend ($1,554.8M \u2192 $1,723.5M)."

The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets and ROU assets related to the store lease are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level.\n\nWe recognized net disposition and impairment charges of $94.0 million, $91.1 million, and $66.6 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Included in these amounts, we recorded $23.3 million, $23.2 million, and $14.3 million of impairment losses within store operating ex penses on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal years ended September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022, respectively. Of the total net disposition and impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2022, $9.6 million was restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment ex penses. Unless it is restructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating ex pense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe majority of our leases are operating leases for our company-operated retail store locations. We also lease, among other things, roasting, distribution and warehouse facilities, and office space for corporate administrative purposes.\n\nWe categorize leases as either operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Operating lease agreements may contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, rent escalation clauses, and/or contingent rent provisions. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for together as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets.\n\nWe recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception. We do not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheet but continue to record rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We review contracts for identified assets where we have the right to direct the use of the asset and record those agreements as embedded leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate at our sole discretion, which are included in the determination of lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nOur lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Given our policy election to combine lease and non-lease components, we also consider fixed common area maintenance ('CAM') part of our fixed future lease payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included in our lease liability.\n\nWe generally cannot determine the interest rate implicit in each of our leases. Therefore, we typically use market and term-specific incremental borrowing rates. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we ex pect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount under similar terms. Because we do not borrow on a collateralized basis, we consider a combination of factors, including our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, the risk profile and funding cost of the specific geographic market of the lease, the lease term, and the effect of adjusting the rate to reflect consideration of collateral. Our credit-adjusted risk-free rate takes into consideration interest rates we pay on our unsecured long-term bonds as well as quoted interest rates obtained from financial institutions.\n\nTotal lease costs recorded as rent and other occupancy costs include fixed operating lease costs, variable lease costs, and short-term lease costs. Most of our real estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as CAM costs, real estate taxes, and other executory costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs also include amounts based on a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels, the costs of which are recognized when probable and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. A significant majority of our leases are related to our company-operated stores, and the related costs are recorded within store operating expenses.\n\nThe ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, initial direct costs, and any tenant improvement allowances received. For operating leases, ROU assets are reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease expense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest ex pense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets.\n\nAdditionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required.

Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies increased marketing spend in 2021, they did so with different strategic focuses\u2014AMZN on scale, BKNG on ROI efficiency, and SBUX on brand and customer loyalty.",

      "answer": "LOW reports a relatively stable level of long-term investments at $199 million in 2022, indicating a conservative stance on long-term financial commitments outside of core operations. MCD actively hedges and manages long-term investments through foreign currency debt and derivatives to mitigate currency risk, particularly in relation to international subsidiaries and affiliate investments. SBUX discloses $281.7 million in long-term investments, including a mix of debt securities and auction rate securities, with a detailed breakdown of fair value across different risk levels. This reveals that while LOW maintains a minimal and stable position, MCD uses financial instruments to manage exposure, and SBUX holds a diversified portfolio with both marketable and less liquid instruments.",

See reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1.\n\n(2) Based on debt obligations before the effects of fair value hedging adjustments and deferred debt costs. These effects are excluded as they have no impact on the obligation at maturity. See the Debt Financing footnote on page 57 of this Form 10-K.\n\n(3) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps used to hedge debt.\n\nStandard &amp; Poor's and Moody's currently rate the Company's commercial paper A-2 and P-2, respectively, and its long-term debt BBB+ and Baa1, respectively. To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings.\n\nCertain of the Company's debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company's debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company's business. In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $15 billion of borrowing capacity with no specified expiration date, of which $8.3 billion remains outstanding as of December 31, 2021. These borrowings may include (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In April 2020, the Company's Board of Directors provided additional authorization to issue commercial paper and draw on lines of credit agreements up to $8 billion in addition to the $15 billion authorized as referenced above. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the SEC and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $4.5 billion available under committed line of credit agreements (see the Debt Financing footnote on page 57 of this Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2021, the Company's subsidiaries also had $263 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.\n\nThe Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments.\n\nIn managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders' equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $12.8 billion and $13.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company's restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies footnote related to financial instruments and hedging activities on page 47 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.\n\nThe Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2021 , neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.",

      "question": "How do AMZN, BKNG, and TSLA each reflect the role of commissions in their business models, and what does this reveal about the varying strategic and regulatory implications of commission-based revenue streams across e-commerce, travel platforms, and automotive sales?",
      "answer": "AMzn discloses that commissions are a distinct revenue component within its third-party seller services, alongside fulfillment and shipping fees. BKNG indicates that regulatory scrutiny, particularly in Europe and Switzerland, poses a risk to its commission structure, with potential requirements to reduce commissions due to ongoing investigations. Tesla reports that commissions are incurred only on vehicle sales and not on ancillary services like Supercharger access or FSD features, and are expensed as incurred due to short fulfillment cycles. Together, these perspectives show that while commissions are a core revenue or cost element across different sectors, they carry distinct regulatory, operational, and strategic implications depending on the industry and business model.",

To the extent that these or any other investigations or inquiries result in additional commitments, fines, damages, or other remedies, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nAs markets evolve and NCAs or other governmental authorities continue to monitor our industry, new investigations of the industry generally or of us specifically could and have occurred, including revisiting issues that were the subject of prior investigations. While we believe that we are complying with our commitments, investigating authorities or third parties may determine that we are not complying with the commitments we have made and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedies. Further, in September 2017 the Swiss Price Surveillance Office opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Booking.com in Switzerland and the investigation is ongoing. If there is an adverse outcome and Booking.com is unsuccessful in any appeal, Booking.com could be required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland. We are cooperating with regulators where applicable, but we are unable to predict what, if any, effect any investigations or resolutions thereof, including the effect of any commitments we might make, will have on our business, industry practices, or online commerce more generally.\n\nTo the extent that regulatory authorities impose fines on us or require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry, our business, competitive position, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Negative publicity regarding competition and/or consumer law investigations could adversely affect our brands and therefore our business, market share, and results of operations. Competition and consumer law-related investigations, legislation, or issues have and could in the future result in private litigation.\n\nAnother area of regulatory inquiry involves contractual search term bidding restrictions where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search terms related to the other party (e.g., such other party's name). Although we are generally moving away from these types of agreements, in some of our contracts, we or the other party have agreed to bidding restrictions. If bidding restrictions are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contracts, it could negatively impact our performance marketing efficiency, business, and results of operations.\n\nThere is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry, especially as technology companies become larger. In some instances, countries have passed legislation that goes further to restrict business activities than actions taken by NCAs or other regulatory authorities. France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and Austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clauses in their entirety and, last year, a German court ruled that our narrow parity clauses are not permitted. Additionally, the EU's Platform to Business Regulation regulates the relationship between online platforms such as Booking.com and European business users of online platforms. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which are expected to give regulators more instruments to investigate digital businesses and impose new rules on certain digital platforms if they are determined to be \"gatekeepers.\" The proposed legislation is not final and it is not entirely known what the laws will look like in their final forms. If regulators were to presume that we are a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act as currently proposed and we are not successful in rebutting that presumption, we would be subject to additional rules and regulations not applicable to all our competitors and our business could be harmed. For example, the rules applicable to gatekeepers could impose limitations on data collection and usage across services or with third parties, as well as on bundling services, and could require gatekeepers to share certain customer information with partners. Wide and possibly any type of parity clauses could be prohibited for gatekeeper platforms. Additionally, in July 2021 President Biden of the United States signed an executive order aimed at restricting anticompetitive practices, including those within the technology industry. Any rules or regulations that result from this executive order, as well as any other new laws and regulations and changing public perception relating to the technology industry could impact our services, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise cause us to incur additional operating costs to comply with or address these developments. Further, as market conditions change as a result of investigations, litigation, legislation, or political or social pressure, we may decide to voluntarily modify our business practices beyond what is required, the full effects of which may not be known when making the decision, but which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWith additional attention on the size of travel or technology companies generally, our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions, our ability to expand into complementary businesses or our latitude in dealing with travel service providers (such as by limiting our ability to provide discounts, rebates, or incentives or to exercise contractual rights), any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or ability to grow and compete.",

Actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of our reserve of $365 million, which represented an increase in automotive sales revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, vehicle pricing reductions resulted in an increase of our reserve of $72 million and $555 million, respectively, which represented decreases in automotive sales revenue.\n\n## Automotive Segment\n\n## Automotive Sales Revenue\n\n## Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Full Self Driving (\"FSD\") features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the estimated useful life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\nAt the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer's lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.\n\nCosts to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n## Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option\n\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value.",

Specifically, a contract is or contains a lease when (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract.\n\nOur leases include certain retail locations, warehouse and distribution space, office space, equipment, and v ehicles. A substantial majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of one to 20 years. Our real estate leases typically prov ide the option to extend the lease for fiv e-year terms, and some of our leases include early termination options. The lease term used to calculate the right-of-use asset and lease liability at commencement includes the impacts of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. When determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option at commencement, we consider v arious existing economic factors, including market conditions, real estate strategies, the nature, length, and terms of the agreement, as well as the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Based on these determinations, we generally conclude that the exercise of renewal options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the present v alue of lease payments is the rate implicit in the lease, when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable, we use a secured incremental borrowing rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis, as the discount rate for the present v alue of lease payments.\n\nReal estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and operating expenses applicable to the leased asset are generally our obligations under our lease agreements. In instances where these payments are fixed, they are included in the measurement of our lease liabilities, and when v ariable, they are excluded and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Certain of our lease agreements also include rental payments based on an index or rate, and others include rental payments based on a percentage of sales. For v ariable payments dependent upon an index or rate, we apply the activ e index or rate as of the lease commencement date. Variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of our lease liabilities, as they cannot be reasonably estimated, and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\n\nLeases that hav e a term of twelv e months or less upon commencement are considered short-term in nature. Short-term leases are not included on the consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis ov er the lease term. We hav e also elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of assets including real estate and certain equipment.\n\nOur lease agreements do not contain any material residual v alue guarantees or material restrictiv e cov enants.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair v alues at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price ov er the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price ov er the fair v alue of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but assess the recov erability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair v alue of each reporting unit supports its carrying v alue. Each fiscal year, we may assess qualitativ e factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair v alue of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitativ e impairment assessments, with a quantitativ e assessment completed periodically or as facts and circumstances warrant. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 4.",

The Company does not account for lease and non-lease (e.g., common area maintenance) components of contracts separately for any underlying asset class.\n\nIf readily determinable, the rate implicit in the lease is used to discount lease payments to present value; however, substantially all of the Company's leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. When the implicit rate is not determinable, the Company's estimated incremental borrowing rate is utilized, determined on a collateralized basis, to discount lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.\n\nThe Company's real estate leases typically require payment of common area maintenance and real estate taxes which represent the majority of variable lease costs. Certain lease agreements also provide for variable rental payments based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums, usage measures, or changes in the consumer price index.  Variable rent payments based on future performance, usage, or changes in indices were not significant for any of the periods presented. Variable lease costs are ex cluded from the present value of lease obligations.\n\nThe Company's lease agreements do not contain any material restrictions, covenants, or any material residual value guarantees. The Company subleases certain properties that are not used in its operations.  Sublease income was not significant for any of the periods presented.\n\nAccounts Payable The Company has an agreement with a third party to provide a supplier finance program which facilitates participating suppliers' ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with designated third-party financial institutions.

The Company's goal in entering into these arrangements is to capture overall savings in the form of pricing, payment terms, or vendor funding, created by facilitating suppliers' ability to finance payment obligations at more favorable discount rates, while providing them with greater working capital flexibility.\n\nThe Company's obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers' decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements.  However, the Company's right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by these arrangements for those payment obligations that have been financed by suppliers.

The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets and ROU assets related to the store lease are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level.\n\nWe recognized net disposition and impairment charges of $94.0 million, $91.1 million, and $66.6 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Included in these amounts, we recorded $23.3 million, $23.2 million, and $14.3 million of impairment losses within store operating ex penses on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal years ended September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022, respectively. Of the total net disposition and impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2022, $9.6 million was restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment ex penses. Unless it is restructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating ex pense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe majority of our leases are operating leases for our company-operated retail store locations. We also lease, among other things, roasting, distribution and warehouse facilities, and office space for corporate administrative purposes.\n\nWe categorize leases as either operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Operating lease agreements may contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, rent escalation clauses, and/or contingent rent provisions. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for together as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets.\n\nWe recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception. We do not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheet but continue to record rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We review contracts for identified assets where we have the right to direct the use of the asset and record those agreements as embedded leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate at our sole discretion, which are included in the determination of lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nOur lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Given our policy election to combine lease and non-lease components, we also consider fixed common area maintenance ('CAM') part of our fixed future lease payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included in our lease liability.\n\nWe generally cannot determine the interest rate implicit in each of our leases. Therefore, we typically use market and term-specific incremental borrowing rates. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we ex pect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount under similar terms. Because we do not borrow on a collateralized basis, we consider a combination of factors, including our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, the risk profile and funding cost of the specific geographic market of the lease, the lease term, and the effect of adjusting the rate to reflect consideration of collateral. Our credit-adjusted risk-free rate takes into consideration interest rates we pay on our unsecured long-term bonds as well as quoted interest rates obtained from financial institutions.\n\nTotal lease costs recorded as rent and other occupancy costs include fixed operating lease costs, variable lease costs, and short-term lease costs. Most of our real estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as CAM costs, real estate taxes, and other executory costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs also include amounts based on a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels, the costs of which are recognized when probable and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. A significant majority of our leases are related to our company-operated stores, and the related costs are recorded within store operating expenses.\n\nThe ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, initial direct costs, and any tenant improvement allowances received. For operating leases, ROU assets are reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease expense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest ex pense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets.\n\nAdditionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required.

      "answer": "AMZN recognizes operating lease costs on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the lease term and distinguishes them from finance leases, which are amortized similarly but have interest expense recognized separately using the effective interest method. NKE reported $593 million in operating lease costs for fiscal 2022, with variable lease costs adding another $366 million, indicating a significant portion of lease obligations are tied to variable terms. SBUX disclosed $1,554.8 million in operating lease costs for fiscal 2022, with variable lease costs at $939.1 million, showing a high degree of lease-related variability. Comparing these, AMZN emphasizes lease classification and amortization methodology, NKE shows relative stability in operating lease costs over time, and SBUX exhibits both high operating and variable lease costs, suggesting a more dynamic or location-sensitive lease structure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.\n\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\n\n## Financing Obligations\n\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.\n\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\n\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See 'Note 5 - Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.'\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $6.8 billion and $10.7 billion.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 18 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nAs of May 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had bank guarantees and letters of credit outstanding totaling $289 million and $275 million, respectively, issued primarily for real estate agreements, self-insurance programs and other general business obligations.\n\nIn connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Company's historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Company's financial position or results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations relating to its business, products and actions of its employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, intellectual property and other matters. The outcome of these legal matters is inherently uncertain, and the Company cannot predict the eventual outcome of currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences relating to those matters. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were to be resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial position, operating results and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the Company does not believe any currently pending legal matters will have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, except as described below.\n\n## BELGIAN CUSTOMS CLAIM\n\nThe Company has received claims for certain years from the Belgian Customs Authorities for alleged underpaid duties related to products imported beginning in fiscal 2018. The Company disputes these claims and plans to appeal. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate the range of loss and cannot predict the final outcome as it could take several years to reach a resolution on this matter. If this matter is ultimately resolved against the Company, the amounts owed, including fines, penalties and other consequences relating to the matter, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\n## NOTE 19 - LEASES\n\nLease expense is recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income, based on the underlying nature of the leased asset. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, lease expense primarily consisted of operating lease costs of $593 million, $589 million and $569 million, respectively. Lease expense also consisted of $366 million, $347 million and $337 million for fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily related to variable lease costs, which includes an immaterial amount of short-term lease costs. As of and for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022 and 2021 and 2020, finance leases were not a material component of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\nThe undiscounted cash flows for future maturities of the Company's operating lease liabilities and the reconciliation to the Operating lease liabilities recognized in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "GM reports that bad debt expense related to its accounts and notes receivable was 'insignificant' in 2021, 2020, and 2019, indicating minimal credit risk exposure in its automotive financing operations. MCD notes that lower bad debt expense contributed to increased operating income in International Operated Markets, suggesting a reduction in credit risk costs in its international franchise operations. NKE includes bad debt expense as part of its operating overhead, but does not quantify the amount, implying that credit risk is a managed but not a prominently disclosed component of its financial operations. Together, these disclosures suggest that GM maintains tight credit controls, MCD has recently improved credit performance in key international markets, and NKE treats bad debt as a routine but opaque part of general operating expenses.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net Revenues is recorded in the period in which such determination is made.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales.\n\n## DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE\n\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary products, television, digital and print advertising as well as media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising media costs are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered.\n\nA significant amount of the Company's promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contracts contain elements that may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies.\n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\n\nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Company's best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the Company's estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.\n\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which the Company records in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense.\n\nThrough cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Company's products. To the extent the Company receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the customer does not exceed the fair value of that good or service, the amounts reimbursed are recorded in Demand creation expense.\n\nTotal advertising and promotion expenses, which the Company refers to as Demand creation expense, were $3,850 million, $3,114 million and $3,592 million for the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $773 million and $630 million at May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $329 million and $338 million, respectively, were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $444 million and $292 million, respectively, were recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepayment applied.\n\n## OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE\n\nOperating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, bad debt expense as well as other administrative expenses such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, certain technology investments, meetings and travel.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 63",

NKE reported a -2.5% impact on its effective tax rate from foreign earnings in 2023, indicating a negative contribution to its tax position. SBUX showed foreign earnings of $913.3 million in fiscal 2023, representing a smaller portion of its total pre-tax earnings compared to its U.S. operations.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.\n\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\n\n## Financing Obligations\n\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.\n\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\n\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See 'Note 5 - Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.'\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $6.8 billion and $10.7 billion.",

Management believes ROIC is a meaningful metric for analysts and investors as a measure of how effectively the Company is using capital to generate financial returns. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC.  Accordingly, the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies.  We encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate ROIC before comparing its ROIC to ours.\n\nWe define ROIC as the rolling 12 months' lease adjusted net operating profit after tax (Lease adjusted NOPAT) divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and shareholders' deficit. Lease adjusted NOPAT is a non-GAAP financial measure, and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure. The calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of net earnings to Lease adjusted NOPAT, is as follows:",

NKE reports $1,807 million in internal-use software on its balance sheet as of May 31, 2024, indicating a significant investment in capitalized internal-use software. TSLA capitalizes internal-use software development costs during the application development stage and amortizes them over 3 to 5 years, with these costs included in Property, Plant, and Equipment, net. Comparing these disclosures reveals that while all three companies account for internal-use software, NKE shows the most substantial current investment, TSLA follows a structured capitalization and amortization framework, and AMZN implies limited capitalization of such costs.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM reported increased freight and material costs contributing $0.3 billion to its overall cost increases, negatively affecting profitability. HD included freight as part of its inventory cost structure, which is influenced by its sourcing and distribution network efficiency. Tesla, in contrast, noted a decrease in inbound freight costs, which contributed to a reduction in the average combined cost per unit of its vehicles, helping to offset some of the downward pressure on gross margin. These differences suggest that Tesla was able to improve its logistics efficiency during a period of sector-wide inflationary pressures, while GM faced rising freight expenses despite broader cost control efforts, and HD absorbed freight into a broader inventory cost framework.",

      "answer": "AMZN addresses construction costs through build-to-suit lease arrangements, where it records assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs when it has control over the building during and after the construction period, reflecting a structured capital allocation approach tied to long-term infrastructure development. HD capitalizes interest and development costs related to construction in progress, amortizing them over the useful life of the software or asset, indicating a focus on controlled, long-term investments in physical and digital infrastructure. SBUX, in contrast, highlights construction cost increases as a risk factor that could hinder its store opening targets, signaling sensitivity to cost volatility and a more cost-conscious, potentially constrained expansion strategy. Collectively, this reveals that AMZN and HD are more systematically investing in infrastructure with upfront cost recognition, while SBUX faces external cost pressures that could limit its physical growth trajectory.",

Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.\n\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\n\n## Financing Obligations\n\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.\n\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\n\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See 'Note 5 - Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.'\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $6.8 billion and $10.7 billion.",

Costs associated with the acquisition and development of software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to seven years. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.\n\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the asset's fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Impairment losses on property and equipment are recorded as a component of SG&amp;A. Impairment charges for long-lived assets were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, or fiscal 2019.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe enter into contractual arrangements for the utilization of certain non-owned assets which are evaluated as finance or operating leases upon commencement, and are accounted for accordingly. Specifically, a contract is or contains a lease when (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract.\n\nWe lease certain retail locations, warehouse and distribution space, office space, equipment, and vehicles. A substantial majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of one to 20 years, typically with the option to extend the leases for five-year terms. Some of our leases may include the option to terminate in less than five years. The",

If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\n## \u00b7 Evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to 'brick &amp; mortar' retail stores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs, the Starbucks Odyssey experience and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a disruption of customer routines, changes to employer 'work-from-home' policies, reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products.",

      "answer": "BKNG notes that their marketing expense increased significantly in 2021 compared to 2020 due to improved travel demand trends post-pandemic, with a focus on variable cost marketing channels and ROI optimization. NKE discloses a rise in demand creation expense from $3,114 million in 2021 to $3,850 million in 2022, reflecting increased investment in brand marketing amid global supply chain disruptions. SBUX also indicates an increase in marketing expenses, though specific figures are not provided, aligning with its broader strategy to drive customer engagement and digital innovation. Collectively, these trends show that while all three firms increased marketing spend in 2022, their strategic rationales reflect sector-specific dynamics: BKNG focused on performance marketing ROI, NKE emphasized brand strength amid supply constraints, and SBUX prioritized customer engagement in a reopening market.",

Starbucks reported $255 million in unrecognized expense related to nonvested RSUs (net of estimated forfeitures), expected to be recognized over 2.3 years, and noted that RSUs granted in recent years had a declining weighted average fair value. Tesla, with a significantly larger position, reported $4.82 billion in unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-performance awards, to be recognized over 2.8 years, and recognized a $326 million tax benefit in 2023 after releasing valuation allowances. These differences suggest varying scales and approaches to equity compensation, with Tesla employing a much larger stock-based incentive structure, Starbucks maintaining a moderate and consistent RSU program, and Home Depot utilizing a more modest and shorter-duration compensation model.",

      "question": "How do HD, LOW, and TSLA differ in their 2026 operating lease obligations, and what does this reveal about their respective capital structures and leasing strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2026, HD reports $646 million in operating lease obligations, LOW reports $560 million, and TSLA reports $232 million. These figures reflect differing leasing strategies and capital structures across the companies. HD and LOW, both in the home improvement retail sector, maintain larger operating lease commitments, consistent with their extensive store networks and real estate footprints. TSLA, while also operating physical locations such as showrooms and service centers, shows significantly lower operating lease obligations, suggesting a more asset-light or owned-asset approach in its retail and production infrastructure. The disparity highlights how operating leases remain a more prominent feature in traditional retail models compared to newer direct-to-consumer automotive strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: HD \u2192 2026 Operating Leases: HD discloses $646 million in operating lease obligations for fiscal 2026, indicating a continued reliance on leased real estate.",

If any of these or other factors m ake the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or im practical, our business could be adversely affected.\n\n## Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\n\nThe principal m aterials used in our footwear products - natural and synthetic rubber, plastic com pounds, foam  cushioning m aterials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane film s - are locally available to m anufacturers. T he principal m aterials used in our apparel products - natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized perform ance fabrics designed to efficiently wick m oisture away from  the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and m etal hardware - are also available in countries where our m anufacturing takes place. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our contract m anufacturers to locate, train, em ploy and retain adequate personnel. N IKE  contract m anufacturers and m aterials suppliers buy raw m aterials and are subject to wage rates and other labor standards that are oftentim es regulated by the governm ents of the countries in which our products are m anufactured.\n\nThere could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw m aterials from  current sources or, in the event of a disruption or heightened com petition for such m aterials, our contract m anufacturers m ight not be able to locate alternative suppliers of m aterials of com parable quality at an acceptable price or at all. F urther, our contract m anufacturers have experienced and m ay continue to experience in the future, unexpected closures, unexpected increases in work wages or other changes in labor standards, whether governm ent mandated or otherwise, and increases in com pliance costs due to governm ental regulation concerning certain m etals, fabrics or raw m aterials used in the m anufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that m anufacturers that we do not contract and that we refer to as \"unaffiliated m anufacturers\" will be able to fill our orders in a tim ely manner. If we experience significant increases in dem and, or reductions in the availability of m aterials, or need to replace an existing contract m anufacturer or m aterials supplier, there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw m aterials or additional m anufacturing capacity will be available when required on term s acceptable to us, or at all, or that any contract m anufacturer, unaffiliated m anufacturer, or any m aterials supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to m eet our requirem ents. E ven if we are able to expand existing or find new m anufacturing capacity or sources of m aterials, we m ay encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the tim e it takes to train suppliers and m anufacturers in our m ethods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. In addition, changes we m ake in m anaging the supply of our products, such as changes to decrease the supply of certain products, pose the risk that we m ay not be able to m eet dem and for, or ram p up production of, certain products tim ely or without additional cost. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, in the supply of m aterials or in the m anufacturing of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to m eet retail custom er and consum er dem and for our products and result in lower revenues and net incom e both in the short- and long-term .\n\nBecause contract m anufacturers m ake a m ajority of our products outside of our principal sales m arkets, our products m ust be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. D elays in the shipm ent or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, container shortages, labor shortages, including work stoppages or port strikes, infrastructure and port congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between m anufacturers, have adversely im pacted, and could in the future adversely im pact the availability of our products and, in turn, our financial perform ance. In addition, delays in the shipm ent or delivery of our products, m anufacturing delays or unexpected dem and for our products have required us, and m ay in the future require us to use faster, but m ore expensive, transportation m ethods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit m argins. T he cost of oil is a significant com ponent in m anufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum  products can adversely affect our profit m argins. C hanges in U .S. trade policies, including m odifications to im port tariffs and existing trade policies and agreem ents, have also had, and could continue to have a significant im pact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our reputation or results of operations.\n\nI n addition, we have becom e, and expect to continue to be, subject to a num ber of regulations that require us to develop new policies and procedures for, strive to m itigate, and report, certain supply chain risks related to sourcing internationally.

Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $625 million and $359 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Automotive Leasing\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\n\n## Services and Other\n\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs of retail merchandise sales.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $756 million and $115 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to affect tax able income. V aluation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax  assets to the amount expected to be realized.",

These differences suggest varying degrees of investment in leased facilities, with HD maintaining the highest near-term commitment, potentially reflecting its extensive retail footprint and distribution infrastructure.

Until it ceases to be used, the Company continues to classify the asset as held-for-use and tests for potential impairment accordingly.  If the Company commits to a plan to abandon a long-lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, its depreciable life is evaluated.\n\nGoodwill - Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, in a business combination. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If, after assessing qualitative factors, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed.\n\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Fair value represents the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on a combination of an income approach, based on discounted future cash flows, and a market approach, based on market multiples applied to free cash flow. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Any impairment identified is included within SG&amp;A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. The income tax effect from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit, if applicable, is considered in determining the goodwill impairment loss.\n\nA reporting unit is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. During fiscal 2021, goodwill was allocated to the U.S. Home Improvement reporting unit. In fiscal 2021, we completed our annual qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for the U.S. Home Improvement reporting unit and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value.\n\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:\n\n",

TSLA, on the other hand, experienced a $568 million increase in employee and labor-related expenses, including payroll taxes, driven by a higher average share price in 2021, which suggests a growing payroll tax burden tied to equity compensation.

Below are those accounting policies considered by the Company to be significant.\n\nFiscal Year The Company's fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest the end of January.  Each of the fiscal years presented contained 52 weeks. All references herein for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 represent the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022, January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned or controlled operating subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nImpacts of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions were put in place in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. At the onset of the pandemic, the Company implemented a number of measures to facilitate a safer store environment and to provide support for its associates, customers and community. Beginning in fiscal 2020, the Company expanded associate benefits in response to COVID-19 to provide additional paid time off, special payments to hourly associates, temporary wage increases and other benefits, which continued through 2021. The Company also continued enhanced cleaning protocols. These actions resulted in $162 million and $1.2 billion of expense included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), which was enacted on March 27, 2020, included measures to assist companies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company deferred the payments of qualifying employer payroll taxes which were required to be paid over two years, with half due by December 31, 2021, and the other half due by December 31, 2022. These amounts are included in cash flows from other operating liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table presents the qualifying employer payroll taxes deferred in accordance with the CARES Act along with the location in the consolidated balance sheets:\n\n",

The loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future office environments or adoption of a new work model that expects employees to work on-site for a specified number of days with some flexibility to work remotely on other days, may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain our employees. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States. We also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success, and we have invested substantial time and resources in building, maintaining and evolving our culture. Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit employees.\n\n## Our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to United States or foreign employment regulations.\n\nWe have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which could have a direct impact on our operating costs. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs. There is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment, health and safety, wage and hour laws, criminal activity, personal injury and other claims. In addition, if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we could be vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Operating a Global Business\n\n## Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business.\n\nVirtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political tensions, unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. Changes in the U.S. government's import and export policies, including trade restrictions, sanctions and countersanctions, increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards or customs restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, disease outbreaks, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, or our costs for manufacturing and procuring materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFurthermore, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as the anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, independent contractors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\n\n## Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\n\nThe principal materials used in our footwear products - natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane films - are locally available to manufacturers. The principal materials used in our apparel products - natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware - are also available in countries where our manufacturing takes\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 18",

The increase is primarily due to an increase of $568 million in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount and increased payroll taxes due to our higher average share price in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. Additionally, there was $340 million of additional payroll tax due to our CEO's option exercises from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, a $319 million increase in office, information technology, facilities-related expenses, sales and marketing activities and other costs and an increase of $145 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $72 million was attributable to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.

      "answer": "Home Depot organizes its business into three geographic operating segments\u2014U.S., Canada, and Mexico\u2014and aggregates them into a single reportable segment due to their similar operating and financial characteristics. Nike provides detailed segment reporting in Note 17 of its financial statements, indicating a structured approach to segment disclosure, though the specific geographic or business-line breakdown is not shown in the provided excerpt. Starbucks evaluates performance based on net revenues and operating income across its operating segments, with identifiable assets including cash, ROU assets, property, and intangible assets, and highlights a strong presence in the U.S. and China, with Japan, Canada, and the U.K. making up the majority of other international revenues. Together, these disclosures reflect varying degrees of geographic segmentation and strategic emphasis, with Home Depot focusing regionally but consolidating for reporting, Nike formalizing segment structure in dedicated notes, and Starbucks emphasizing both geographic and asset-based performance metrics.",

Topic 832 requires disclosure of the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item, and significant terms of the transactions. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-10 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nASU 2020-04. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,' which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. These amendments are not applicable to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. ASU No. 2020-04 is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and may be applied to contract modifications and hedging relationships from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. While the discontinuance of LIBOR will impact our interest rate swap agreements and certain of our credit arrangements, we do not anticipate the transition to a new reference rate and adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nRecent accounting pronouncements adopted or pending adoption not discussed above are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## 2. NET SALES AND SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nWe currently conduct our retail operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents one of our three operating segments. Our operating segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is used to make decisions and allocate resources.

      "question": "How do AMZN, GM, and MCD each manage or depend on fixed costs in their respective business models, and what does this reveal about their operational strategies in a high-investment, inflation-sensitive environment?",
      "answer": "AMZN seeks to leverage its fixed costs, which include technology infrastructure, online store development, and fulfillment network optimization, to support long-term scalable growth. GM highlights that its profitability is constrained by a high proportion of fixed costs, particularly from property, plant, equipment, and labor agreements, which limit flexibility in adjusting to demand fluctuations. MCD benefits from substantial property holdings at fixed costs, which provide cost stability amid inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. Together, these perspectives reveal that while AMZN focuses on scaling to absorb fixed costs, GM faces structural rigidity from them, and MCD gains resilience through fixed-cost predictability in real estate.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Fixed Costs: AMZN mentions that fixed costs include infrastructure and fulfillment network investments, and the company aims to leverage these to enable scalable, long-term growth.",

      "answer": "Home Depot capitalizes certain software development costs and amortizes them over 3 to 7 years using the straight-line method, while other development costs not meeting capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred. Nike reports a significant value of internal-use software at $1.807 billion for fiscal 2024, showing a growing investment in software assets. Tesla capitalizes software development costs incurred during the application development stage and amortizes them over 3 to 5 years, and also capitalizes costs related to software intended for sale after technological feasibility is established. This reveals that while all three companies recognize software development as a strategic asset, they differ in the extent and timing of capitalization and in the amortization periods applied.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, GM reported other comprehensive income of $4,206 million, indicating a positive shift in comprehensive income. LOW showed an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $36 million, reflecting a slight negative adjustment. SBUX reported an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $463.2 million, which suggests a significant negative impact on equity. These figures highlight differing exposures to foreign currency translation adjustments, defined benefit plans, and other comprehensive income components across the three firms, with GM benefiting from these items while LOW and SBUX faced losses, albeit at different scales.",

        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 Comprehensive Loss: GM reported other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, at $4,206 million in 2022, driven by foreign currency translation adjustments and defined benefit plans.",

D ollars for consolidated reporting. T he translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. D ollar denom inated balance sheets into U .S. D ollars for consolidated reporting results in a cum ulative translation adjustm ent to Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e, a weaker U .S. D ollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U .S.

The im pact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detrim ent of approxim ately $141 m illion for the year ended M ay 31, 2024. T he im pact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Incom e before incom e taxes was a benefit of approxim ately $48 m illion for the year ended M ay 31, 2024.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTo m inim ize the im pact of translating foreign currency denom inated revenues and expenses into U .S.

T he variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U .S. D ollar denom inated investm ents at non-U .S. D ollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U .S. G AAP . W e utilize forward contracts and/or options to m itigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U .S. D ollar investm ents. T he com bination of the purchase and sale of the U .S. D ollar investm ent and the hedging instrum ent has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation im pact on net earnings in the period the investm ents are sold.

D ollar, which could adversely im pact the U .S. D ollar value of these investm ents and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. W e have, in the past, hedged and m ay, in the future, hedge net investm ent positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to m itigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investm ents. T hese hedges are accounted for as net investm ent hedges in accordance with U .S. G AAP . T here were no outstanding net investm ent hedges as of M ay 31, 2024 and 2023.

      "question": "How do AMZN, MCD, and NKE each quantify their net state tax exposure in 2023, and what do these figures suggest about the relative impact of state-level tax policies on their effective tax rates?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Amazon (AMZN) reported a net state tax impact of $1,307 million, which increased its overall tax expense. McDonald's (MCD) showed a 1.8% contribution from state taxes to its effective tax rate, indicating a relatively modest but consistent burden. Nike (NKE) reported a 1.5% contribution from state taxes, which remained stable compared to the prior year.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Competition\n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, virtual assistants, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure, tools and services relating to artificial intelligence, and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, communications, and other electronic devices and services; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats; and (10) providers of virtual or inperson healthcare services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 1,556,000 fulltime and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nWe strive to be Earth's best employer. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement this objective and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible employees). Over 240,000 Amazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at Amazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

The CODM has the ultimate decision-making authority for resource allocation and assessing the performance of the Company. Thereby, the CODM regularly reviews consolidated net earnings as the measure of segment profit or loss, as well as significant segment expenses included in the below table, to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital.

      "answer": "HD reports that its services revenue is derived from installation, home maintenance, and professional service programs, where both labor and materials are included in services revenue under certain programs. This revenue is recognized upon service completion, which typically occurs within one week. LOW provides a breakdown of its 2022 net sales, showing that services revenue was $2.3 billion, or about 2.4% of total net sales, up from $1.95 billion in 2021. TSLA includes services revenue as part of its 'Services and Other Revenue' category, which encompasses repair and maintenance services, used vehicle sales, and retail merchandise, with revenue recognized over time as services are delivered or over the performance period for service contracts. These differences show that HD and LOW treat services as a complementary extension of product sales, while TSLA integrates services more broadly into its post-purchase customer engagement strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nWe use derivative instruments in the management of our interest rate exposure on long-term debt and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only; we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recognized at their fair values in either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and are classified as either current or non-current based on each contract's respective maturity. While we enter into master netting arrangements, our policy is to present the fair value of derivative instruments gross in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nChanges in the fair values for derivative instruments designated as cash flow or net investment hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, which for net investment hedges is upon sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investment. Changes in fair value of outstanding fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged item are recognized in earnings. We record realized gains and losses from derivative instruments in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item.\n\nDerivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, if any, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings each period in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item. Cash flows from the settlement of derivative instruments appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same categories as the cash flows of the hedged item.\n\n## Insurance\n\nWe are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, and automobile claims. We recognize the expected ultimate cost for claims incurred (undiscounted) at the balance sheet date as a liability. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.\n\nOur self-insurance liabilities, which are included in accrued salaries and related expenses, other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, were $1.3 billion at January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021.\n\nWe also maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security. Insurance-related expenses are included in SG&amp;A.\n\n## Treasury Stock\n\nTreasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity at cost. We use the weighted-average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued, if any.\n\n## Net Sales\n\nWe recognize revenue, net of expected returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed. Our liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels and our expectation of future returns. We also recognize a return asset, and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales, for our right to recover the goods returned by the customer, measured at the former carrying amount of the goods, less any expected recovery cost. At each financial reporting date, we assess our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities, and return assets. Adjustments related to changes in return estimates were immaterial in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019.\n\nNet sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance, and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and we provide or arrange for professional installation. These programs are offered through our stores, online, and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when we provide or arrange for the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. We recognize this revenue when the service for the customer is complete, which is not materially different from recognizing the revenue over the service period as the substantial majority of our services are completed within one week.\n\nFor products and services sold in stores or online, payment is typically due at the point of sale. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete. Such performance obligations are part of contracts with expected original durations of typically three months or less. As of",

          "chunk_text": "## Automotive Leasing Revenue\n\n## Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\n\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles to us or, for Model S and Model X in certain regions, may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $1.25 billion, $752 million and $532 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had deferred $392 million and $293 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\n\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n## Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program\n\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842 in certain countries in Asia and Europe, which we introduced during the third quarter of 2020. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly under these programs for up to 48 months. Our loan arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $369 million and $120 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $234 million and $87 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\n\n## Services and Other Revenue\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\nRevenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.",

      "answer": "BKNG reports total future operating lease payments of $890 million with a present value of $751 million after interest, indicating a significant but relatively moderate lease exposure. LOW discloses $402 million of operating lease payments related to extension options that are reasonably certain to be exercised, while excluding $179 million of leases not yet commenced, suggesting a more conditional and partially deferred lease liability. TSLA, in contrast, shows much larger operating lease commitments totaling $5,360 million, with a present value of $4,343 million, indicating a significantly higher reliance on operating leases, particularly for long-term obligations. These differences highlight varying degrees of reliance on off-balance sheet financing through operating leases, with TSLA being the most leveraged and BKNG the least among the three.",

HD experienced a significant increase in goodwill, rising from $7,444 million to $8,455 million in fiscal 2023, primarily due to $998 million in acquisitions. SBUX saw a net decrease in goodwill from $3,283.5 million to $3,218.3 million, with a $65.2 million reduction in the first half of the year, followed by a $97.4 million increase later, indicating phased acquisition or revaluation activity.

We also continued to undertake a number of additional measures for the safety of our associates and customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Our Supply Chain\n\nWe continue to focus on building best-in-class competitive advantages in our supply chain to be responsive to our customers' expectations for how, when and where they choose to receive our products and services. As part of enhancing the interconnected shopping experience, we continue to invest in expanding our supply chain network, with the goal of achieving the fastest, most efficient and reliable delivery capabilities in home improvement. Our efforts are focused on ensuring product availability and increasing the speed and reliability of delivery for our customers while managing our costs. Despite the challenges faced by the global supply chain in fiscal 2021, our supply chain investments permitted us to continue to operate effectively and meet our customers' needs.\n\nWe centrally forecast and replenish the vast majority of our store products through sophisticated inventory management systems and utilize our network of distribution centers to serve both our stores' and customers' needs. Our supply chain includes multiple distribution center platforms in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico tailored to meet the needs of our stores and customers based on types of products, location, transportation, and delivery requirements. These platforms include rapid deployment centers, stocking distribution centers, bulk distribution centers, and direct fulfillment centers. As part of the expansion of our supply chain, we have invested to further automate and mechanize our rapid deployment center network to drive efficiency and faster movement of product.\n\nWe are also expanding our fulfillment network, investing in a significant number of new fulfillment facilities to drive speed and reliability of delivery for our customers and to help us meet our goal of reaching 90% of the U.S. population with same or next day delivery for extended home improvement product offerings, including big and bulky products. These facilities include omni-channel fulfillment centers, which deliver product directly to customers, and market delivery operations, which function as local hubs to consolidate freight for dispatch to customers for the final mile of delivery, with a focus on appliances. We are also adding flatbed distribution centers, which handle large items like lumber that are transported on flatbed trucks. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we have opened a number of additional fulfillment facilities and will continue to build out our fulfillment network over the next few years. This network is designed to create a competitive advantage with unique, industry-leading capabilities for home improvement needs.\n\nIn addition to our distribution and fulfillment centers, we leverage our stores as a network of convenient customer pickup, return, and delivery fulfillment locations. Our premium real estate footprint provides a distinct structural and competitive advantage. For customers who shop online and wish to pick up or return merchandise at, or have merchandise delivered from, our U.S. stores, we have fully implemented our four interconnected retail programs: BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS, and BORIS. To meet customer needs due to the pandemic, we rapidly rolled out curbside pickup to complement our BOPIS offerings, in addition to the self-service lockers at the front entrance of many of our stores. We also offer express car and van delivery service that covers over 75% of the U.S. population. As of the end of fiscal 2021, approximately 55% of our U.S. online orders were fulfilled through a store. We also continue to focus on developing new capabilities to improve both efficiency and customer experience in our store delivery program. Our strategic intent is to have a portfolio of efficient, timely and reliable sources and methods of delivery to choose from, optimizing order fulfillment and delivery based on customer needs, inventory locations and available transportation options.\n\n## Corporate Responsibility and Human Capital Management\n\nWe organize our environmental, social and governance efforts around three pillars: (1) Focus on Our People, (2) Operate Sustainably, and (3) Strengthen Our Communities. Highlights of each of these pillars are set forth below. These pillars are reflective of our commitment to ESG and are fundamentally embedded in our operations and culture. We believe this approach creates value for all of our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, supplier partners, and the communities we serve, in turn creating long-term value for our shareholders. For further information on our three pillars and other ESG-related matters, see our annual ESG Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility.\n\nFocus on Our People. Our culture and our associates provide intangible and hard-to-replicate competitive advantages. We leverage these competitive advantages to provide an outstanding customer experience by putting customers first and taking care of our associates.\n\nCulture and Values. The Home Depot has a strong commitment to ethics and integrity, and we are a values- and culture-centric business. Our commitment to our core values drives our approach to human capital management. Our culture is based on our servant leadership philosophy represented by the inverted pyramid, which puts primary",

          "chunk_text": "as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, collective bargaining units, the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees, the distinction between employees and contractors, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, health care, data privacy and cybersecurity, the sale and pricing of some of our products, transportation, logistics, international trade, responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, taxes, unclaimed property, sustainability, the environment and climate change, including energy costs and consumption, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to reputation and legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFuture litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements, negatively affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are, and in the future will become, involved in lawsuits, including consumer, commercial, employment, tort and other litigation, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments. Furthermore, defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management's attention and resources. None of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved, individually or collectively, are considered material.\n\nThe inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products and our sales. Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber, copper, and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices, such as changes in lumber prices, affect the demand for our products and our sales.\n\nTax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.\n\nWe may be affected by higher rates of federal, state, or local tax imposed as a result of political developments or economic conditions, which could affect our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by regulatory and legal changes, the results of tax audits and examinations, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters, all of which could negatively impact our business. In addition, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLiquidity and access to capital rely on efficient, rational and open capital markets and are dependent on Lowe's credit strength. Our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business, financial performance and results of operations. We have relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund our working capital needs. Our access to these markets depends on our strong credit ratings, the overall condition of debt capital markets and our operating performance. Disruption in the financial markets or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs.\n\n## Item 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 2 - Properties\n\nAt January 28, 2022, our properties consisted of 1,971 stores in the United States and Canada with a total of approximately 208 million square feet of selling space.  Of the total stores operating at January 28, 2022, approximately 84% are owned, which includes stores on leased land, with the remainder being leased from third parties.  We also operate regional distribution centers and other facilities to support distribution and fulfillment, as well as data centers and various support offices.

SBUX, on the other hand, explicitly states that its finance lease assets were immaterial as of October 2, 2022, and are recorded within property, plant, and equipment, net, with corresponding liabilities in accrued liabilities. TSLA provides quantitative detail, showing that in 2022 (derived from 2021 data), it obtained $486 million in leased assets through finance leases, indicating a more material and active use of finance leases compared to SBUX. These differences highlight varying degrees of reliance on and transparency around finance lease assets across the three firms.",

Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.\n\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\n\n## Financing Obligations\n\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.\n\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\n\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See 'Note 5 - Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.'\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $6.8 billion and $10.7 billion.",

TSLA, in contrast, experienced a significant decline in interest on lease liabilities from $72 million in 2022 to just $21 million in 2024, implying a strategic reduction in finance lease reliance.

      "answer": "Amazon reported a 22% increase in international sales in 2021 compared to the prior year, attributing the growth to increased unit sales and advertising, though it expected a deceleration in Q1 2022. Lowe\u2019s disclosed international sales of $5.9 billion in 2022, showing steady but smaller international presence compared to its dominant U.S. market. Nike highlighted risks in its international operations, including geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory changes, which could negatively impact its global business performance. Together, these perspectives show that while Amazon is aggressively growing its international footprint, Lowe\u2019s maintains a more domestic focus, and Nike faces complex global challenges that require strategic risk mitigation.",

          "chunk_text": "## The success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality employees, including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture and values.\n\nOur success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future office environments or adoption of a new work model that expects employees to work on-site for a specified number of days with some flexibility to work remotely on other days, may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain our employees. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States. We also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success, and we have invested substantial time and resources in building, maintaining and evolving our culture. Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit employees.\n\n## Our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to United States or foreign employment regulations.\n\nWe have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which could have a direct impact on our operating costs. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs. There is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment, health and safety, wage and hour laws, criminal activity, personal injury and other claims. In addition, if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we could be vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Operating a Global Business\n\n## Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business.\n\nVirtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political tensions, unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. Changes in the U.S. government's import and export policies, including trade restrictions, sanctions and countersanctions, increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards or customs restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, disease outbreaks, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, or our costs for manufacturing and procuring materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFurthermore, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as the anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, independent contractors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\n\n## Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\n\nThe principal materials used in our footwear products - natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane films - are locally available to manufacturers. The principal materials used in our apparel products - natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware - are also available in countries where our manufacturing takes\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 18",

      "question": "How do HD, LOW, and SBUX differ in the magnitude and trend of their Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) in 2022, and what does this reveal about their exposure to foreign currency translation adjustments and other comprehensive income items?",
      "answer": "In 2022, HD reported an Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) of $704 million, an increase from $671 million in the prior year, indicating a growing negative impact from foreign currency translation and other OCI items. LOW showed a much smaller AOCL of $36 million, a significant decrease from $136 million in the prior year, suggesting a reduction in its exposure to such risks. In contrast, SBUX experienced a substantial AOCL of $463.2 million in 2022, a significant increase from $147.2 million the previous year, reflecting heightened exposure to foreign exchange volatility and other comprehensive losses. These differences highlight varying degrees of international exposure and risk management strategies across the three firms.",

        "Hop 1: HD \u2192 Comprehensive Loss: HD's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss increased to $704 million in 2022 from $671 million in 2021, showing a growing impact of foreign currency translation and other OCI items.",
        "Hop 2: LOW \u2192 Comprehensive Loss: LOW's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss was $36 million in 2022, down from $136 million in 2021, indicating a meaningful reduction in comprehensive losses, possibly due to hedging or reduced international exposure.",
        "Hop 3: SBUX \u2192 Comprehensive Loss: SBUX's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss surged to $463.2 million in 2022 from $147.2 million in 2021, signaling a major increase in foreign exchange losses or other OCI impacts, likely due to its global footprint and currency fluctuations."

      "question": "How do BKNG, LOW, and SBUX each characterize the timing and recognition of their advertising expenses, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to marketing investment?",
      "answer": "BKNG distinguishes between performance marketing and brand marketing expenses, recognizing performance marketing costs as incurred while deferring production costs until the advertisement is first displayed. LOW charges all advertising costs to expense as incurred, with disclosed amounts reaching $877 million in 2021, indicating a consistent and immediate expensing policy. SBUX generally expenses advertising costs as incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed when the advertising first airs, with advertising expenses rising to $416.7 million in fiscal 2022. These differences suggest that BKNG takes a segmented and strategic approach to marketing spend, LOW maintains a straightforward and consistent expense recognition, and SBUX applies a nuanced approach with some deferral. Collectively, this reveals varying philosophies toward marketing investment and financial reporting alignment with marketing impact.",

Marketing expenses consist of performance marketing expenses and brand marketing expenses. Performance marketing expenses are expenses generally measured by return on investment or an increase in bookings over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) offline and online brand marketing; and (5) other performance-based marketing and incentives. Performance marketing expenses are recognized as incurred. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued performance marketing liabilities of $306 million and $156 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Brand marketing expenses are expenses incurred to build brand awareness over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of television advertising and online video and display advertising (including the airing of the Company's television advertising online), as well as other marketing expenses such as public relations and sponsorships. Brand marketing expenses are generally recognized as incurred with the exception of advertising production costs, which are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is displayed or broadcast.\n\n## Sales and Other Expenses\n\nSales and other expenses are generally variable in nature and consist primarily of: (1) credit cards and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations, and other services; (3) chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions; (4) customer relations costs; and (5) provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables and prepayments to certain customers.\n\n## Personnel\n\nPersonnel expenses consist of compensation to the Company's personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health and other benefits. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued compensation liabilities of $421 million and $333 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to performance share units, restricted stock units and stock options is recognized based on fair value on a straight-line basis over the respective requisite service periods and forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. The fair value on the grant date of performance share units and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of units granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock. For performance share units with market conditions, the effect of the market condition is also considered in the determination of fair value on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. The fair value of employee stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model.\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards using its estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets or performance goals, as applicable). The Company periodically adjusts the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results or expected achievement of performance goals, as applicable.\n\nThe benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs are recognized in the income statement as a discrete item when an option exercise or a vesting and release of shares occurs. Excess tax benefits are presented as operating cash flows and cash payments for employee statutory tax withholding related to vested stock awards are presented as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information related to stock-based awards.",

They earn loyalty points ('Stars') in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit cards. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country.\n\nWe defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months.\n\nWhen a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue.\n\n## Other Revenues\n\nOther revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms.\n\nOther revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestl\u00e9 related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestl\u00e9 are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales.\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods and packaging costs as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $416.7 million, $305.1 million and $258.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2024, Home Depot (HD) reported immaterial net earnings from its acquisition of SRS, despite $6.4 billion in net sales from the acquisition. Lowe's (LOW) highlighted that a 10% change in its self-insurance liability would have impacted net earnings by approximately $72 million, indicating a notable sensitivity to insurance-related costs. Starbucks (SBUX) reported net earnings of $3,760.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024, showing a decline from the prior year.

We expect approximately $1.0 billion of goodwill related to the acquisition to be deductible for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. At this time, all preliminary goodwill has been allocated to our three SRS reporting units and no goodwill currently resides in our Primary segment.\n\nWe have completed valuation analyses necessary to assess the fair v alues of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the amount of goodwill to be recognized as of the acquisition date. These fair v alues were based on management's estimates and assumptions; howev er, the amounts indicated above are preliminary in nature and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, there may be adjustments to the assigned v alues of acquired assets and liabilities assumed. Areas that remain preliminary primarily relate to income taxes, as well as any changes to residual goodwill resulting from measurement period adjustments. The final determination of acquisition date fair v alues and residual goodwill will be completed as soon as practicable, and within the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date as permitted under GAAP. Any adjustments to prov isional amounts that are identified during the measurement period will be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined. Measurement period adjustments recognized during fiscal 2024 were immaterial.\n\nResults of Operations. Net sales attributable to SRS since the completion of the acquisition and included within our results of operations for fiscal 2024 totaled $6.4 billion. Net earnings attributable to SRS since the completion of the acquisition and included within our results of operations for fiscal 2024 were immaterial.\n\nPro forma results of operations would not be materially different as a result of the acquisition and therefore are not presented.\n\n## Other Fiscal 2024 Acquisitions\n\nAll other acquisitions completed during fiscal 2024 were immaterial both indiv idually and in the aggregate.\n\n## Fiscal 2023 Acquisitions\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we completed three indiv idually immaterial acquisitions for total aggregate cash purchase consideration of $1.5 billion. We recognized aggregate definite-liv ed intangible assets of $469 million with a weighted av erage amortization period of 17 years, primarily related to customer relationships, and goodwill of $1.0 billion. The goodwill arising from the acquisitions resides in our Primary segment and is primarily attributable to operational synergies and acceleration of growth strategy, as well as the assembled workforce. The portion of goodwill generated through these acquisitions that is expected to be deductible for U.S. federal and state tax purposes is not material. Measurement period adjustments recognized during fiscal 2024 were immaterial and our purchase price allocations are now finalized.\n\nNet sales and net earnings for fiscal 2023 attributable to these acquisitions in the aggregate after their respectiv e acquisition dates were immaterial. Pro forma results of operations would not be materially different as a result of the acquisitions in the aggregate and therefore are not presented.\n\nItem 9.

Adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.\n\n## Self-Insurance\n\n## Description\n\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, property, general and product liability, extended protection plans, and certain medical and dental claims. We have excess insurance coverage above certain retention amounts to limit exposure from single events and earnings volatility. Our selfinsured retention or deductible, as applicable, is limited to $2 million per occurrence involving workers' compensation, and $10 million per occurrence involving general liability, product liability, and automobile liability. We do not have any ex cess insurance coverage for self-insured ex tended protection plan or medical and dental claims. Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. During fiscal 2024, our self-insurance liabilities decreased approximately $138 million to $966 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nThese estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment, utilized discount rate, projected exposures including payroll, sales and vehicle units, as well as the frequency, lag and severity of claims.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. Although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. A 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $72 million for fiscal 2024. A 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $18 million for fiscal 2024.\n\n## Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nIn addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are ex posed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nWe use interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt. The fair value of our derivative financial instruments as of January 31, 2025, was not material. Fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because nearly all of our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fix ed-rate instruments.  Therefore, providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control, which could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations.  We believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices.  The selling prices of these commodity products are influenced, in part, by the market price we pay and our competitive environment.",

      "answer": "BKNG recognizes excess tax benefits as a discrete item in the income statement upon option exercise or vesting, and presents them as operating cash flows. SBUX reports excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as a reduction in its effective tax rate, with specific values of (0.5)% in FY2022, (0.9)% in FY2021, and (4.2)% in FY2020. TSLA notes that future excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation are among the factors it considers when evaluating the realizability of its U.S. deferred tax assets, which remain fully offset by a $9.07 billion valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021. Together, these approaches show that BKNG treats the benefit transactionally, SBUX experiences it as a measurable tax rate impact, and TSLA incorporates it into its broader assessment of future tax asset recovery.",

Marketing expenses consist of performance marketing expenses and brand marketing expenses. Performance marketing expenses are expenses generally measured by return on investment or an increase in bookings over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) offline and online brand marketing; and (5) other performance-based marketing and incentives. Performance marketing expenses are recognized as incurred. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued performance marketing liabilities of $306 million and $156 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Brand marketing expenses are expenses incurred to build brand awareness over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of television advertising and online video and display advertising (including the airing of the Company's television advertising online), as well as other marketing expenses such as public relations and sponsorships. Brand marketing expenses are generally recognized as incurred with the exception of advertising production costs, which are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is displayed or broadcast.\n\n## Sales and Other Expenses\n\nSales and other expenses are generally variable in nature and consist primarily of: (1) credit cards and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations, and other services; (3) chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions; (4) customer relations costs; and (5) provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables and prepayments to certain customers.\n\n## Personnel\n\nPersonnel expenses consist of compensation to the Company's personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health and other benefits. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued compensation liabilities of $421 million and $333 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to performance share units, restricted stock units and stock options is recognized based on fair value on a straight-line basis over the respective requisite service periods and forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. The fair value on the grant date of performance share units and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of units granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock. For performance share units with market conditions, the effect of the market condition is also considered in the determination of fair value on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. The fair value of employee stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model.\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards using its estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets or performance goals, as applicable). The Company periodically adjusts the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results or expected achievement of performance goals, as applicable.\n\nThe benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs are recognized in the income statement as a discrete item when an option exercise or a vesting and release of shares occurs. Excess tax benefits are presented as operating cash flows and cash payments for employee statutory tax withholding related to vested stock awards are presented as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information related to stock-based awards.",

          "chunk_text": "As of December 31, 2021, we recorded a valuation allowance of $9.07 billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized. The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $6.14 billion, $974 million, and $150 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to additional U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year. We have $417 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. We did not have any material releases of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We continue to monitor the realizability of the U.S. deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors. In completing this assessment, we considered both objective and subjective factors. These factors included, but were not limited to, a history of losses in prior years, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, future reversal of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. After evaluating all available evidence, we intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Given the improvement in our operating results and depending on the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future, we may release the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. deferred tax assets in the next few years. Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.\n\nThe reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in millions):\n\n",

In contrast, SBUX discloses that its finance lease assets are immaterial as of September 29, 2024, suggesting a preference for operating leases or direct asset purchases rather than finance leases.

TSLA reports $29 million in debt issuance costs in 2023, directly tied to its debt financing activities, which are treated as deductions from the proceeds of debt issuance. Comparing these approaches, BKNG uses complex convertible debt with embedded equity components and significant issuance costs, HD maintains a more traditional long-term debt structure with transparent amortization, and TSLA incurs smaller issuance costs relative to its overall capital structure, reflecting a more streamlined debt strategy.",

      "question": "How do AMZN, HD, and NKE each characterize the impact of shipping costs on their financial performance, and what does this reveal about their differing sensitivities to logistics expense trends?",
      "answer": "AMZN reports that shipping costs were $83.5 billion in 2022 and $89.5 billion in 2023, noting that these costs are expected to continue increasing due to customer adoption of shipping offers and more expensive shipping methods, though they aim to offset this through network optimization and supplier negotiations. HD indicates that rising shipping costs, alongside other commodity and transportation pressures, could negatively impact their profit margins, especially in light of geopolitical conflicts and inflationary trends. NKE, in contrast, notes a decrease in shipping costs\u2014specifically lower ocean freight and logistics costs\u2014contributing to a 220 basis point expansion in gross margin in fiscal 2024, despite lower revenues. This reveals that AMZN is scaling with rising logistics costs, HD is vulnerable to external cost pressures, and NKE has recently benefited from declining freight rates.",

Nike uses EBIT as its primary metric to evaluate operating segment performance, indicating a strong focus on operational efficiency across its global segments, though specific EBIT figures are not directly disclosed in the provided excerpt. Starbucks reported an operating income (equivalent to EBIT) of $5,408.8 million on total net revenues of $36,176.2 million, resulting in an EBIT margin of about 15.0%. The differences in EBIT margins suggest that Starbucks maintains a leaner cost structure relative to revenue compared to Home Depot, while Nike\u2019s segment-focused reporting highlights a strategic emphasis on managing regional profitability amid global market dynamics.",

      "answer": "Home Depot evaluates long-lived assets at the individual store level and compares undiscounted future cash flows to carrying value to determine impairment, with no material impairment charges in fiscal 2024. McDonald's uses undiscounted future cash flows at the field office or market level to assess restaurant asset impairments and also applies discounted cash flow models in valuing acquired restaurants, recording $240 million in goodwill during 2024. Nike discloses $3,367 million in total undiscounted future cash flows related to lease payments, with a present value of $3,043 million after interest, indicating a structured approach to lease liability valuation. These differences show that HD focuses on store-level asset scrutiny, MCD manages assets at a portfolio level with active acquisition and goodwill tracking, and NKE emphasizes lease liability transparency with cash flow breakdowns.",

Costs associated with the acquisition and dev elopment of software are amortized using the straight-line method ov er the estimated useful life of the software, which ranges from three to sev en years. Certain dev elopment costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.\n\nWe evaluate our long-liv ed assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its prev iously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recov erable. The ev aluation for long-liv ed assets is performed at the lowest lev el of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the indiv idual store lev el. Long-liv ed assets with indicators of impairment are ev aluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying v alue. If the carrying v alue is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the asset group's fair v alue to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair v alue is less than the carrying v alue, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying v alue and the estimated fair v alue. Impairment losses on property and equipment are generally recorded as a component of SG&amp;A.

          "chunk_text": "## LEASING\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned and operated restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under nonrestaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\n## CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE\n\nCapitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 3 to 10 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within M iscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2024-$907; 2023-$836; 2022-$864.\n\nThe Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists. Results for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected the write-off of impaired software no longer in use of $72 million. The Company did not identify any indicators of material impairment of capitalized software for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022.\n\n## LONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing M cDonald's restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office lev el, and internationally , at a market lev el. The Company  manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.\n\nLosses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Company's Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered 'held for sale.\"\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of M cDonald's restaurants from franchisees or transactions in which the Company obtains a controlling interest in subsidiaries or affiliates. When purchasing restaurants from a franchisee, the Company generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology (Level 3 inputs within the valuation hierarchy), which determines the fair value of restaurants acquired based on their expected profitability and cash flows. During 2024, the Company acquired restaurants from franchisees (including 228 restaurants in Israel, which are presented within the International Developmental Licensed M arkets &amp; Corporate segment) in order to support key franchising initiatives. Total restaurant acquisitions for the year resulted in the Company recording approximately $150 million of net tangible assets, $270 million of identifiable intangible assets (primarily consisting of reacquired franchise rights) and $240 million of goodwill. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on the amount of recorded revenues or net income of the Company. If a Company-owned and operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a Company-owned and operated restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.\n\nThe following table presents the 2024 activity in goodwill by segment:\n\n",

NKE discloses that variable lease costs were $366 million, $347 million, and $337 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, representing a significant portion of its total lease expenses. SBUX reports variable lease costs of $939.1 million, $949.6 million, and $833.4 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, showing a consistent but slightly fluctuating exposure.

Operating Leases\n\n## Operating Leases\n\nOur  portfolio  of  leases  primarily  consists  of  real  estate  office  space,  manufacturing  and  warehousing  facilities,  land  and equipment. Certain leases contain escalation clauses and renewal or purchase options, and generally our leases have no residual value  guarantees  or  material  covenants.  We  exclude  leases  with  a  term  of  one  year  or  less  from  our  balance  sheet,  and  do  not separate non-lease components from our real estate leases.\n\nRent expense under operating leases was $294 million, $317 million and $354 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Variable lease costs were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, operating lease right of use assets in Other assets were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, operating lease liabilities in Accrued  liabilities  were  $204  million  and  $209  million  and  non-current  operating  lease  liabilities  in  Other  liabilities  were $1.0 billion and $969 million. Operating lease right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations were $328 million and $222 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Company's historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Company's financial position or results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations relating to its business, products and actions of its employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, intellectual property and other matters. The outcome of these legal matters is inherently uncertain, and the Company cannot predict the eventual outcome of currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences relating to those matters. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were to be resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial position, operating results and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the Company does not believe any currently pending legal matters will have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, except as described below.\n\n## BELGIAN CUSTOMS CLAIM\n\nThe Company has received claims for certain years from the Belgian Customs Authorities for alleged underpaid duties related to products imported beginning in fiscal 2018. The Company disputes these claims and plans to appeal. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate the range of loss and cannot predict the final outcome as it could take several years to reach a resolution on this matter. If this matter is ultimately resolved against the Company, the amounts owed, including fines, penalties and other consequences relating to the matter, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\n## NOTE 19 - LEASES\n\nLease expense is recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income, based on the underlying nature of the leased asset. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, lease expense primarily consisted of operating lease costs of $593 million, $589 million and $569 million, respectively. Lease expense also consisted of $366 million, $347 million and $337 million for fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily related to variable lease costs, which includes an immaterial amount of short-term lease costs. As of and for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022 and 2021 and 2020, finance leases were not a material component of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\nThe undiscounted cash flows for future maturities of the Company's operating lease liabilities and the reconciliation to the Operating lease liabilities recognized in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How do AMZN, HD, and LOW each account for their finance lease assets, and what does this reveal about their capital structure and asset utilization strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "AMZN accounts for finance lease assets by amortizing them over the lesser of the asset\u2019s useful life or the lease term, with these assets recorded under 'Property and equipment, net.' HD discloses that its finance lease assets totaled $2.84 billion as of January 28, 2024, and are recorded under Net property and equipment, showing a slight decline from $2.899 billion in the prior year. LOW reports that its finance lease assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization, which stood at $326 million as of February 2, 2024, up from $244 million the previous year. This indicates varying approaches: AMZN focuses on amortization and integration into broader property and equipment, HD maintains a relatively stable finance lease asset base, and LOW shows increasing amortization, suggesting more active utilization or expansion of leased assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Finance Lease Assets: AMZN amortizes finance lease assets over the shorter of the asset's useful life or lease term and records them under 'Property and equipment, net.'",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\nNet Sales. Fiscal 2024 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2023. Net sales for fiscal 2024 increased $6.8 billion, or 4.5%, to $159.5 billion. T he increase in net sales for fiscal 2024 was primarily driv en by SRS, which contributed $6.4 billion of net sales during fiscal 2024, and incremental net sales of approximately $2.5 billion attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2024. This increase in net sales was partially offset by the impact of a negativ e comparable sales env ironment, primarily driv en by decreases in comparable customer transactions and comparable av erage ticket.\n\nOnline sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or deliv ered to customer locations, represented 15.1% of net sales and increased by 6.6% during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, including the online sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2024.\n\nA stronger U.S. dollar negativ ely impacted net sales by $298 million in fiscal 2024.\n\nComparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period ov er the comparable prior period of equiv alent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52 week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they hav e been owned for more than 52 weeks. Our comparable sales results for fiscal 2024 exclude the 53rd week and compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2024 to the 52-week period reported for fiscal 2023. The method of calculating comparable sales v aries across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. nd\n\nTotal comparable sales decreased 1.8% in fiscal 2024, reflecting a 1.0% decrease in comparable customer transactions and a 0.9% decrease in comparable average ticket compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in comparable customer transactions primarily reflects the impact of heightened macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including the impacts of a persisting high interest rate env ironment pressuring home improvement demand. The decrease in comparable av erage ticket primarily reflects price stabilization relativ e to last year, slightly offset by demand for new and innovativ e products.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, our Power and Building Materials merchandising departments posted positiv e comparable sales compared to fiscal 2023. All of our other merchandising departments posted negativ e comparable sales during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\n\n## Gross Profit\n\nGross profit increased $2.3 billion, or 4.6%, to $53.3 billion in fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.4% for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, and primarily reflected lower transportation costs and lower shrink within our Primary segment, offset by the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOur operating expenses are composed of SG&amp;A and depreciation and amortization.\n\nSelling, General &amp; Administrative. SG&amp;A increased $2.2 billion, or 8.1%, to $28.7 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, SG&amp;A was 18.0% in fiscal 2024 compared to 17.4% in fiscal 2023, which primarily reflects higher payroll costs, delev erage from a negativ e comparable sales env ironment and lower legal-related benefits.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $361 million, or 13.5%, to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.9% in fiscal 2024 compared to 1.8% in fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense of $239 million, of which $218 million was related to SRS, as well as increased depreciation expense from ongoing inv estments in the business.\n\n## Interest and Other, net\n\nInterest and other, net increased $355 million, or 20.1%, to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2024.

Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking or conditional words, such as 'could,' 'should,' 'can,' 'continue,' 'aim,' 'estimate,' 'forecast,' 'intend,' 'look,' 'may,' 'will,' 'ex pect,' 'believ e,' 'anticipate,' 'plan,' 'remain,' 'confident,' 'commit,' 'enable,' 'potential' and \"trajectory \" or similar ex pressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. They reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the dates the statements are made. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update such forward-looking statements. Y ou should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.\n\n## Risk F actors\n\nOur business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. A dditional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly adversely affect our business. If any of these risks were to materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies - including the components of our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy - must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's continued ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, including by maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu items, and doubling down on digital, delivery, drive thru and restaurant development;\n- innovate and differentiate the M cDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- build upon our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including building one of the world's largest consumer platforms to fuel engagement;\n- run great restaurants by building the easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform which enables franchisees to run restaurants more efficiently  and utiliz e the latest cloud-based technology  to make it easier for crews to deliv er ex ceptional customer service;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and building a modern company platform that unlocks speed and innovation throughout the organization; and\n- evolve and adjust our strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, and other events impacting our results of operations and liquidity.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in evolving or executing against our strategies, if the execution of our strategies proves to be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value or relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo continue to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value and relevance of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at M cDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which continuously evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, as well as by our perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. In addition, we cannot ensure that franchisees or business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.\n\nIf we do not anticipate and address industry trends and evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and industry trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to the use of digital channels and environmental and social responsibility matters. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors are\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 28",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM discussed the role of weighted average common shares outstanding in its earnings per share calculations, indicating a focus on basic and diluted EPS without disclosing specific share numbers. NKE reported a weighted average of 1,551.6 million common shares outstanding, showing a declining trend over the past three years, suggesting share repurchase activity or reduced issuance. SBUX disclosed 1,146.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding, also showing a decreasing trend, consistent with NKE, pointing to potential buybacks or tighter equity management.

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Risks related to our operations\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability  of  affordable  financing,  elevated  interest  rates,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  fuel,  consumer  confidence  and  demand  for  vehicles,  political  unrest  or uncertainty, the occurrence of a public health crisis, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A. If our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reasons, including a moderate to severe recession in any of the markets in which we operate, it could lead to a significant decrease in new vehicle sales, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for commodities, raw materials, energy or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may continue to lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, elevated cost, or reduced availability, of critical materials for our EV  propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EV s and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. G eopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic, regulatory and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials, energy and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\nOur business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of  the  largest  global  manufacturers  and  numerous  domestic  manufacturers,  which  have  ex perienced  significant  growth  in  customer  acceptance,  as  well  as  nontraditional  market  participants,  such  as  domestic  technology  companies.  Over  the  last  several  years,  this  intense  competition  and  an  increasingly  challenging operating environment negatively impacted the profitability of our operations in China, our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. As a result, in December 2024, our Board of Directors determined there to be a material loss in value of our investments in certain of the China JV s. Updated business forecasts and recent restructuring actions to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions have indicated that the loss in value is other-than-temporary for our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), certain SGM subsidiaries and SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC). As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024. We also recorded additional equity losses of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of these restructuring actions, which includes plant closures and portfolio optimization, in the year ended December 31, 2024. These charges are non-cash in nature. We expect SGM will likely incur additional restructuring charges in 2025. We cannot guarantee that the restructuring actions will be successful in our China JV s achieving long-term profitability or that additional, material restructuring actions will not be required.\n\nIn addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EV s, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies while achieving affordability. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China and the unique regulatory landscape in China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions, weakening economic conditions in China or China's level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.",

We hav e faced and may continue to face additional challenges in recruiting and retaining associates due to wage pressure; flexible scheduling needs; health and safety concerns; and challenges related to a remote or hybrid working environment for associates who work in our store support centers. These factors, together with competition among potential employers, hav e resulted in and may continue to result in increased compensation costs, and/or may impair our ability to recruit and retain associates, which could hav e an adv erse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. A limited number of our associates at SRS are represented by labor unions, and we are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our associates from time to time. If successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility and efficiency, and/or otherwise negativ ely impact our operations or reputation.\n\nIn addition, to execute our interconnected retail strategy, including our supply chain inv estments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals, to implement our ongoing technology and other inv estments. The market for these professionals is very competitiv e. An inability to prov ide wages and/or benefits, including remote or hybrid work flexibility, that are competitiv e within the markets in which we operate could adv ersely affect our ability to retain and attract associates.\n\nAdditionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectiv ely motiv ate and retain associates is critical to our business success. If we are unable to attract, dev elop or retain qualified associates, or manage leadership transitions successfully, our ability to effectiv ely manage our strategy may be negativ ely impacted, the quality of serv ice we prov ide to our customers may decrease, and our financial performance may be adv ersely affected.\n\n## A failure of one or more key information technology systems or processes could adversely affect our business, financial results, and reputation.\n\nWe rely extensiv ely on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, use, retain, manage, transmit, and protect transactions and data. Some of these systems are managed or prov ided by third-party serv ice prov iders, including certain cloud platform prov iders. In managing our business, we also rely heav ily on the integrity of, security of, and consistent access to, systems that prov ide operational and financial data and capabilities related to sales (both in store and online), customer data, supplier data, associate data, job applicant data, partner data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inv entory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment, customer serv ice, and post-purchase matters. For these information technology systems, applications, and processes to operate effectiv ely, we or our serv ice prov iders must maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching of these systems, applications or processes, as well as the actions taken to maintain, update, upgrade and patch, could, and on occasion hav e, impaired their operation and effectiv eness or exposed us to security risks. Our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact, as well as any systems those third parties utilize, are subject to, and on occasion have experienced, damage, interruption, or malicious activ ity from a number of causes, including power and other critical infrastructure outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer v iruses; data or security breaches; internal or external data theft or misuse; cyberattacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, smishing, v ishing, spyware, denial of serv ice attacks, and ransomware; responsiv e containment measures by us that may inv olv e v oluntarily taking systems offline; natural disasters and catastrophic ev ents such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, or other extreme weather ev ents; public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines; geopolitical or military conflicts, acts of war, terrorism or civ il unrest; other systems outages; inadequate or ineffectiv e redundancy; and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our associates, contractors or third-party serv ice prov iders. In addition, as more business activ ities hav e shifted online, and as many of our store support associates continue to work in a remote or hybrid env ironment, we face an increased risk due to the potential failure of internal or external information technology infrastructure as well as increased cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks.\n\nAlthough we and our third-party serv ice prov iders seek to maintain our respectiv e systems effectiv ely and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts are not always successful. As a result, we or our serv ice prov iders could experience, and on occasion hav e experienced, errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of serv ice in key portions of our information technology",

          "chunk_text": "or volatility  can also result from acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. The broader impact of acts of war and related sanctions, including on macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical tensions, consumer demand and the ability of us and our franchisees to operate in certain geographic areas, may also have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\nWhile we may face challenges and uncertainties in any of the markets in which we operate, such challenges and uncertainties are often heightened in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. A n inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.\n\nWe depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure a reliable and sufficient supply of quality products, equipment and other materials on favorable terms. A lthough many of these items are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain items have limited suppliers, which increases our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases have in the past and may in the future adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be caused by shortages, inflationary pressures, unexpected increases in demand, transportation-related issues, labor-related issues, technology-related issues, weather-related events, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, or other factors beyond our control or that of our suppliers or franchisees. Interruptions in our System's supply chain or ineffective contingency planning can increase our costs, impact ingredient quality, delay new restaurant openings, and/or limit the quality  or av ailability  of products, equipment and other materials that are critical to our Sy stem's operations or to restaurant development.\n\n## Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.\n\nOur success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-owned and operated restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. If franchisee sales trends worsen, or any of such risks materialize or intensify, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.\n\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks' lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors, including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.\n\n## Continued challenges with respect to labor, including availability and cost, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\nOur success depends in part on our System's ability to effectively attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in M cDonald's restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staffed restaurants in an intensely competitive labor market. We and our franchisees have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in adequately staffing certain M cDonald's restaurants, which can negatively impact operations, including speed of service to customers, and customer satisfaction levels. The System's ability to meet its labor needs as they evolve is generally subject to a variety of factors, including the availability  of sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate.\n\nFurther, our System has experienced increased costs and competition associated with attracting, recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining qualified employees, as well as with promoting awareness of the opportunities of working at M cDonald's restaurants. We and our franchisees also continue to be impacted by increasingly complex U.S. and international laws and regulations affecting our respective workforces. These laws and regulations are increasingly focused on, and in certain cases impose requirements with respect to, employment matters such as wages and hours, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Such laws and regulations can expose us and our franchisees to increased costs and other effects of compliance, including potential liability, and all such labor and compliance costs could have a negative impact on our Company-owned and operated margins and franchisee profitability.\n\nOur potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety, could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. A dditionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to attract, recruit, dev elop, motiv ate and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results.",

      "answer": "GM reports that bad debt expense related to accounts and notes receivable was 'insignificant' in 2023, 2022, and 2021, indicating strong credit control and low exposure to customer defaults in vehicle financing. In contrast, NKE highlights that deteriorating retailer financial conditions could lead to 'increased bad debt expense' due to late payments or insolvencies among retail partners. SBUX similarly notes that unfavorable economic conditions could result in 'increased bad debt expense' due to financial hardships faced by suppliers and licensees. While GM appears to have minimal current exposure, both NKE and SBUX explicitly link rising bad debt risk to macroeconomic pressures affecting their business partners, revealing differential exposure based on their respective business models\u2014GM with direct customer financing, and NKE/SBUX through wholesale and licensing networks.",

        "Hop 2: NKE \u2192 Bad Debt Expense: NKE warns that if retailers of its products face financial difficulty or insolvency, it could result in 'greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense,' linking macroeconomic risk directly to credit exposure.",
        "Hop 3: SBUX \u2192 Bad Debt Expense: SBUX notes that unfavorable economic conditions could lead to supplier or licensee insolvency, which would 'increase our bad debt expense' and require higher unsecured credit provisions, showing sensitivity to partner financial health."

      "question": "How do AMZN, BKNG, and MCD each characterize their 'Other Expense' line items in 2021, and what do these differences suggest about their respective non-operating financial performance drivers?",
      "answer": "In 2021, AMZN reported $137 million in 'Other operating expense (income), net' and a significantly negative $14,306 million in 'Other expense (income), net', indicating substantial non-operating losses, potentially from investment or foreign exchange impacts. BKNG reported a net $697 million loss in 'Other income (expense), net', largely driven by losses on equity securities and debt extinguishment. MCD, in contrast, showed a relatively small $14 million in 'Other expense', suggesting minimal non-operating financial impact. These differences highlight how each company experienced varying levels of financial volatility outside of core operations, with AMZN and BKNG facing more pronounced headwinds compared to MCD.",

        "Hop 2: BKNG \u2192 Other Expense: BKNG reported a net 'Other income (expense), net' of $697 million in 2021, primarily due to a $569 million loss on equity securities and a $242 million loss on early debt extinguishment.",

Our inventory turnover ratio was 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 5.8 times at the end of fiscal 2020. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment.\n\nWe generated $16.6 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt during fiscal 2021.

Management believes ROIC is a meaningful metric for analysts and investors as a measure of how effectively the Company is using capital to generate profits. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC.  Accordingly, the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies.  We encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate ROIC before comparing its ROIC to ours.\n\nWe define ROIC as the rolling 12 months' lease adjusted net operating profit after tax (Lease adjusted NOPAT) divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and shareholders' (deficit)/equity. Lease adjusted NOPAT is a non-GAAP financial measure, and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure.

TSLA notes that foreign exchange gains and losses from its foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities directly impact its 'Other income (expense), net' line, and it experienced a $257 million favorable change in 2021 due to FX movements.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $370 million.\n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.\n\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\n\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncompetitors, our costs may increase, demand for our products may decline, possibly significantly, or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products.\n\n## Economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global economic environment, including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates, could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.\n\nA majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Central banks may deploy various strategies to combat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which may impact our borrowing costs. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates including as a result of U.S. policy changes and the Russia and Ukraine conflict that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.\n\nWe extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. The ongoing financial uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, particularly for retailers, could also have an effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition.\n\n## Climate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nThere are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused, and may continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate, increases in global temperatures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extreme weather and climate events. Climate change may also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw materials, including those used in the production of our products, and may result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, there has been increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably made and other sustainability matters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and materials transparency, any of which may require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities in various countries have proposed, and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or mitigate the impacts of climate change on the environment. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change, which could increase the complexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment, may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the production of our products or the demand for our products, and, in turn, may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 12",

      "question": "How do AMZN, GM, and TSLA each manage or disclose the financial risks associated with intercompany balances, and what do their approaches reveal about their exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations?",
      "answer": "AMZN discloses that its intercompany balances are exposed to foreign exchange risk, and an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change in exchange rates would result in losses of $320 million, $640 million, and $1.3 billion, respectively, recorded to 'Other income (expense), net.' GM eliminates intercompany balances in consolidation and does not specifically disclose foreign exchange risk related to them, implying a more internalized or neutralized approach within its financial reporting. TSLA notes that it experiences gains or losses from the re-measurement of intercompany balances denominated in non-local currencies, with a 10% adverse change in exchange rates potentially resulting in a $1.01 billion impact on net income before taxes. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three companies deal with intercompany balances, their approaches to managing foreign exchange risk vary significantly, with AMZN and TSLA explicitly quantifying exposure while GM focuses on internal elimination.",

        "Hop 2: GM \u2192 Intercompany Balances: GM eliminates all intercompany balances during consolidation, indicating that such balances are internally reconciled and not exposed to external financial risk.",

      "question": "How do BKNG, GM, and MCD differ in the scale and amortization approach for their capitalized software assets, and what does this reveal about their respective technology investment strategies?",
      "answer": "BKNG reported $1,096 million in capitalized software as of December 31, 2023, with an estimated useful life ranging from 1 to 7 years, indicating a relatively short amortization period likely aligned with rapid software innovation cycles. GM held $2.2 billion in capitalized software within Property, net as of the end of 2023, though it did not specify amortization periods, suggesting a potentially broader or less segmented approach to software asset management. MCD reported $836 million in capitalized software as of December 31, 2023, with useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years, and noted that customer-facing software is typically amortized over shorter periods, while back-office systems have longer lives. MCD also recognized a $71.7 million write-off of obsolete software in 2023, indicating active management of software lifecycle and relevance. Collectively, these disclosures reveal differing approaches: BKNG focuses on rapid-cycle software assets, GM integrates software more broadly within physical assets without detailed segmentation, and MCD maintains a structured lifecycle approach with active impairment monitoring.",

        "Hop 1: BKNG \u2192 Capitalized Software: Discloses $1,096 million in capitalized software with useful lives of 1 to 7 years, indicating a focus on relatively short-lived software assets.",

LOW reported a finance lease cost of $119 million in 2022 (amortization: $89 million, interest: $30 million), reflecting a smaller scale of finance lease activity.

HD explains that it records debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying value of related senior notes and amortizes them over the term using the effective interest rate method. TSLA, on the other hand, shows in its cash flow statement that it incurred $9 million in debt issuance costs in 2021, $6 million in 2020, and $37 million in 2019, indicating a declining trend in such costs over time.

      "question": "How do BKNG, GM, and LOW each characterize the impact of investment value fluctuations on their financial condition or strategic initiatives, and what does this reveal about their exposure to market volatility?",
      "answer": "BKNG highlights that declines in the value of its investment portfolio, including marketable debt and equity securities as well as private company investments, could materially affect its financial condition and results of operations due to volatility in credit losses, impairments, and fair value changes. GM reports that its investments in joint ventures exceeded its share of underlying net assets by $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, indicating a significant carrying value that could be impacted by market or performance-related volatility. LOW notes that failure to realize the intended benefits of investments in strategic initiatives\u2014such as omnichannel and digital retail technologies\u2014could result in the loss of investment value, directly linking strategic execution risk to investment valuation. Together, these perspectives reveal that BKNG faces direct financial risk from market-driven investment impairments, GM maintains a large strategic investment position in joint ventures with inherent valuation complexity, and LOW ties investment value to internal execution of digital transformation initiatives.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BKNG \u2192 Investment Value: BKNG discloses that investment impairments and market volatility in both public and private portfolios have had, and are likely to continue to have, a significant impact on quarterly net income and financial condition.",
        "Hop 2: GM \u2192 Investment Value: GM reports that its carrying amount in joint ventures exceeded its share of net assets by $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, indicating a substantial investment value exposure that may be sensitive to market or performance volatility.",
        "Hop 3: LOW \u2192 Investment Value: LOW states that failure to realize benefits from investments in omnichannel and digital initiatives could result in loss of investment value, tying strategic execution risk directly to investment valuation."

      "answer": "GM evaluates inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), using FIFO, and considers market and economic conditions, profitability, sales incentives, and auction proceeds for off-lease vehicles. HD applies NRV to approximately 38% of its merchandise inventories, using FIFO for certain subsidiaries, and adjusts quarterly if carrying value exceeds NRV, though these adjustments were not material in fiscal 2023. NKE records inventory reserves when estimated NRV falls below cost, charging the difference to Cost of sales, and updates these reserves based on changing demand and market conditions. Together, these approaches show varying degrees of sensitivity to market volatility and forward-looking adjustments in asset valuation.",

      "answer": "GM defines and adjusts EBIT to exclude items such as impairment charges, recall-related costs, and currency devaluations, and uses EBIT-adjusted as a key metric for assessing performance and capital allocation decisions. NKE uses EBIT as the primary financial measure to evaluate performance of individual operating segments, and integrates EBIT into its segment reporting and foreign exchange risk management framework. SBUX does not explicitly reference EBIT, but reports 'Operating income' and 'Earnings before income taxes' as proxies, showing a more traditional GAAP-based reporting structure without EBIT-specific adjustments. Together, this reveals that GM and NKE both rely heavily on EBIT (or EBIT-adjusted) as a core performance metric, with GM customizing it for strategic clarity and NKE embedding it into segment analysis, while SBUX leans on broader GAAP income measures without a tailored EBIT approach.",

For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  consolidated diluted  EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares  outstanding-diluted.  Examples  of  income  tax  adjustments  include  the  establishment  or  reversal  of  significant  deferred  tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our  core  operations  on  a  consistent  basis.  ETR-adjusted  is  calculated  as  Income  tax  expense  less  the  income  tax  related  to  the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before  income  taxes  less  adjustments. When  we  provide  an  expected  adjusted  effective  tax  rate,  we  do  not  provide  an  expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  investment  and  capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review  the  liquidity  of  our  automotive  operations  and  to  measure  and  monitor  our  performance  against  our  capital  allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted  automotive  free  cash  flow  as  automotive  operating  cash  flow  from  operations  less  capital  expenditures  adjusted  for management actions.  Management  actions  can  include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

Global Brand Divisions costs represent demand creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Company's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, Corporate included a non-recurring impairment charge, recognized as a result of the Company's decision to transition certain NIKE Brand businesses within APLA to a third-party distributor. This charge primarily reflected the anticipated release of associated non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses. For more information regarding this charge, refer to Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures.\n\nThe primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nAs part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 87",

      "question": "How do BKNG, HD, and SBUX differ in their approach to stock option grants, particularly in terms of grant activity, exercise prices, and strategic emphasis on stock options as a form of employee compensation?",
      "answer": "BKNG reports stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2023, indicating ongoing use of stock options as part of its compensation structure. HD shows specific grant activity of 235 thousand shares during the year, with a weighted average exercise price of $283.85, signaling active use of stock options at a high exercise value. In contrast, SBUX explicitly states that stock options have not been broadly used in recent years and notes that no stock options were granted during fiscal years 2022, 2023, or 2024, favoring RSUs instead. This reveals that while HD is actively granting options at a premium price point, BKNG maintains an ongoing stock option program, and SBUX has largely phased them out in favor of other equity compensation instruments.",

      "answer": "Amazon reported a significant increase in cash paid for income taxes, reaching $12,308 million in 2024, reflecting higher profitability or changes in tax planning. Home Depot noted a reduction in cash paid for income taxes due to IRS relief that deferred a federal tax payment into fiscal 2025, impacting its 2024 tax outflows and increasing income taxes payable. Starbucks, in contrast, disclosed $1,373.3 million in cash paid for income taxes in 2024, indicating a more stable tax payment pattern compared to the other two firms.

Our total accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions were immaterial as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024.\n\n## Other\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the IRS prov ided automatic income tax relief to taxpayers in certain southeastern states, extending the timeline to make certain tax payments. As a result, our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 estimated federal tax payment has been deferred to the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which reduced our cash paid for income taxes during fiscal 2024 and increased income taxes payable at February 2, 2025.\n\n## Fiscal 2024 Form  10-K",

MCD has a structured lease payment schedule with $1.126 billion in operating lease payments due in 2024, declining slightly over the next few years, and a large 'thereafter' bucket of $12.132 billion, suggesting a steady, long-dated rollout of new locations. TSLA discloses $892 million in 2024 operating lease payments, with a declining trend through 2028 and a total of $1.820 billion thereafter, reflecting its scaling retail and service infrastructure in support of vehicle delivery growth.

      "question": "How do McDonald's (MCD), Nike (NKE), and Starbucks (SBUX) each characterize the role of royalties in their business models, and what does this reveal about their respective reliance on and risks associated with third-party partners?",
      "answer": "McDonald's (MCD) generates stable and predictable revenue through franchisee royalties based on a percentage of sales, with minimum rent payments and initial fees upon new restaurant openings. This heavily franchised model ensures consistent cash flow tied directly to franchisee performance. In contrast, Nike (NKE) faces risks if its licensees underperform, as reduced sales by these partners could directly lower royalty income and damage brand value. Starbucks (SBUX) receives royalties on retail sales from licensed stores, which accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022, while also selling branded products and equipment to licensees. Comparing these perspectives, MCD relies most heavily on royalties as a core revenue driver, NKE views royalties as a valuable but vulnerable income stream dependent on third-party execution, and SBUX integrates royalties with product sales in a complementary licensing model. Together, these views illustrate varying degrees of strategic dependence on and exposure to licensee performance across the consumer discretionary sector.",

The Company's heavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales, and resulting cash flow streams.\n\n## Developmental License or Affiliate\n\nUnder a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees are responsible for operating and managing their businesses, providing capital (including the real estate interest) and developing and opening new restaurants. The Company generally does not invest any capital under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, and it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally receives initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license.\n\nWhile developmental license and affiliate arrangements are largely the same, affiliate arrangements are used in a limited number of foreign markets (primarily China and Japan) within the International Developmental Licensed Markets segment as well as a limited number of individual restaurants within the International Operated Markets segment, where the Company also has an equity investment and records its share of net results in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.\n\n## PURPOSE, MISSION AND VALUES\n\nThrough its size and scale, McDonald's embraces and prioritizes its role and commitment to the communities in which it operates through its:\n\n- Purpose to feed and foster communities;\n- Mission to create delicious feel-good moments for everyone; and\n- Core Values that define who we are and how we run our business.\n\nAt McDonald's, we are guided by our five core values:\n\n1. Serve - We put our customers and people first;\n2. Inclusion - We open our doors to everyone;\n3. Integrity - We do the right thing;\n4. Community - We are good neighbors; and\n5. Family - We get better together.\n\nThe Company believes that its people, all around the world, set it apart and bring these values to life on a daily basis.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Company's people strategies aim to create an environment grounded in diversity, equity and inclusion-to continually evaluate and evolve compensation and benefits programs, while offering quality training and learning opportunities, and to uphold a high standard of health and safety for employees and customers alike.\n\nYou can find more information about the Company's human capital management and related initiatives on the 'Our Purpose &amp; Impact' section of its website, which is updated periodically as such matters evolve.\n\n## Our People\n\nCompany employees, which include those in the Company's corporate and other offices as well as in Company-owned and operated restaurants, totaled approximately 200,000 worldwide as of year-end 2021, of which over 75% were based outside of the U.S. In addition to Company employees, the over two million individuals who work in McDonald's franchised restaurants around the world are critical to the Company's success, enabling it to drive long-term value creation and further its purpose and mission. People are at the cornerstone of the Company's business and an essential part of the McDonald's System.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nThe Company's aspiration is that no matter where you are in the world, when you interact with McDonald's, diversity, equity and inclusion ('DEI') are as evident and familiar as the Arches themselves. A diverse workforce is and will continue to be critical to McDonald's success, and the Company is committed to making this a continued priority. Under the leadership of its Board of Directors, the Company adheres to a global DEI strategy designed to drive accountability across the System to better represent the diverse communities in which McDonald's operates, to accelerate cultures of inclusion and belonging and to further dismantle barriers to economic opportunity.\n\nThe Company's DEI strategy reflects its commitment to deliver equitable treatment for all people and includes:\n\n- ongoing efforts to improve the representation of women and historically underrepresented groups at all levels of the Company;\n- a recruitment initiative to help increase the number of franchisees from all backgrounds, including historically underrepresented groups;\n- best practice sharing with franchisees and suppliers to support them in furthering DEI progress within their own organizations;\n- upholding human rights and cultivating a respectful workplace that is ethical, truthful and dependable; and\n- a commitment to equitable pay among Company employees with comparable job responsibilities, experience, performance and contributions and fair treatment in access, opportunity and advancement for all.\n\nWhile McDonald's is proud of its more than 65-year history as an employer, this global DEI strategy is designed to facilitate continued growth in how the Company approaches equitable opportunity and its role in catalyzing it across the System and beyond. The Company is committed to accelerating representation, inclusion and opportunity for historically underrepresented groups, not only within the Company but across the System. This goal is underscored by the Company's Mutual Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, a pledge that invites the Company's U.S. suppliers to commit to accountability for DEI progress within their own organizations.

Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, secure, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, as use of our digital platforms continues to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consumers' needs. If we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline.\n\nRisks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\n\nWe rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\n\nWe are heavily dependent on Information Technology Systems, across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. We cannot provide assurance, however, that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our Information Technology Systems and prevent cyber-attacks, system failures or data or information loss. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the increased use of employee-owned devices for communications as well as work-from-home arrangements, such as those implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, present additional operational risks to our Information Technology Systems, including, but not limited to, increased risks of cyber-attacks. Further, like other companies in the retail industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future.\n\nWe also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.\n\n## We are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.\n\nWe currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.\n\nWe also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands.

Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

HD reinvests in its business to drive growth faster than the market, allocating $2.6 billion in fiscal 2021 to capital expenditures aimed at enhancing the customer experience through digital integration and omnichannel capabilities. In contrast, LOW faces operational challenges that could negatively impact business growth, particularly in adapting to evolving customer expectations and executing large-scale strategic initiatives, which require new competencies and significant investment in technology and talent.

We offer our customers a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, d\u00e9cor products, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products and provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rental. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we operated 2,317 stores located throughout the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000 square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. We also maintain a network of distribution and fulfillment centers, as well as a number of e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. When we refer to 'The Home Depot,' the 'Company,' 'we,' 'us' or 'our' in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number at that address is (770) 433-8211.\n\n## Our Business\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nThe retail landscape has changed rapidly over the past several years, with customer expectations constantly evolving. In fiscal 2021, this trend continued due to the challenges created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the broader domestic and global business environment, including supply chain disruptions, tight labor market conditions, and inflationary pressures. To navigate this dynamic environment and meet heightened levels of home improvement demand throughout the year, we had to operate with agility while also managing evolving requirements to support customer and associate safety.\n\nOur ability to operate successfully and meet the needs of our customers was due in significant part to our strategic investments over the past several years aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our customers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds. Going forward, we will leverage the momentum of these strategic investments and continue to invest in our business in support of the following goals:\n\n- We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement;\n- We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement; and\n- We intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement.\n\nWe believe that these goals will help us grow faster than the market and deliver value to our shareholders. We are steadfast in this commitment, while also recognizing that exercising corporate responsibility and being informed by the needs of our other stakeholders, including our customers, associates, supplier partners, and communities, creates value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.\n\n## Deliver Shareholder Value\n\nWe deliver on our objective to create shareholder value through our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our capital allocation principles are as follows:\n\n- First, we intend to reinvest in our business to drive growth faster than the market.\n- Second, after meeting the needs of the business, we look to return excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We intend to increase our dividend as we grow earnings.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we invested $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support an interconnected customer experience. We also focused on driving productivity throughout the business to lower our costs. The combination of reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales and driving productivity to lower costs creates what we refer to as a virtuous cycle, which has allowed us to improve the customer experience, increase our competitiveness in the market, and deliver shareholder value.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we returned approximately $22 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We paid $7.0 billion in cash dividends and returned approximately $15.0 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases in fiscal 2021. Our capital allocation is discussed further in Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## PART I",

In connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC.\n\n## Strategic, Competitive, Operational, and Reputational Risks\n\nWe may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits, demands, and demographics of our customers, or realize the intended benefits of strategic initiatives. The home improvement retail environment, like the retail environment generally, is rapidly evolving, and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers' changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success. Our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic, social, style, and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings. Customers' expectations about how they wish to research, purchase, and receive products and services have also evolved. It is difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand. As customers begin to expect a more personalized experience, our ability to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group is important to our ability to effectively meet customer expectations. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers.\n\nFurther, we have a store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. Our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (known as 'shrink'). Higher rates of shrink, which we have experienced from time to time, can require operational changes that may increase costs.\n\nFailure to identify such trends, adapt our business concept, implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment, improve and maintain safe stores, and implement change, growth, productivity and other strategic initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell, the rate of growth of our business, our market share, and results of operations.\n\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them.\n\nOur interactions with customers have evolved into an omnichannel experience as they increasingly are using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business. Omnichannel retail is quickly evolving, and we must anticipate and meet our customers' expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors. Our customer-facing technology systems must appeal to our customers, function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience. We also need to collect, use and share relevant customer data to effectively meet customer expectations of a more personalized experience. Our ability to collect, use, and share such data is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security, as well as the change of third party policies restricting data collection, use, and sharing.\n\nThe success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers' changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics have required us to and will continue to require us to deliver large, complex programs requiring integrated planning, initiative prioritization, and program sequencing. These initiatives have required and will continue to require new competencies in many positions, and our management, employees and contractors have had to and will need to continue to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. To the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, to support our strategic initiatives and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals. The market for these professionals is increasingly competitive. Our results of operations, financial condition, or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers, regardless of sales channel, if our technology systems do not meet our customers' expectations, if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors or if we are unable to attract, retain and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the Company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment.",

      "question": "How did payroll tax expenses impact BKNG, NKE, and TSLA differently in 2021, and what does this reveal about each company's exposure to labor cost fluctuations?",
      "answer": "BKNG experienced a $136 million expense in 2021 due to the return of government assistance tied to payroll taxes, reflecting its participation in wage subsidy programs during the pandemic. NKE highlighted that payroll taxes are part of its broader exposure to employment regulations, noting that changes in such laws could significantly affect its operating costs. TSLA reported a notable increase in payroll taxes linked to a rise in the average share price and $340 million in additional payroll tax due to CEO option exercises, directly tying its payroll tax expense to executive compensation and stock performance. This reveals that BKNG was managing the reversal of pandemic-related tax relief, NKE was more broadly sensitive to regulatory shifts, and TSLA's payroll tax burden was heavily influenced by stock-based compensation and executive incentives.",

We participated in several of these programs, including the Netherlands' wage subsidy program and the United Kingdom's job retention scheme. In 2021, we voluntarily returned assistance received through various government aid programs and we recorded the $136 million in expense mentioned above to reflect the return of such assistance.\n\nIn response to the reduction in our business volumes as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 we took actions at all of our brands to reduce the size of our workforce to optimize efficiency and reduce costs, which resulted in annualized personnel cost savings relative to our personnel expense run rate at the end of the first quarter of 2020 of approximately $370 million. Headcount was flat year-over-year at 20,300 as of December 31, 2021, but given the timing of our restructuring actions in the second half of 2020, the average headcount for 2021 decreased about 20% compared to 2020.\n\nStock-based compensation expense was $370 million in 2021 compared to $233 million in 2020. The increase in stockbased compensation expense in 2021 was impacted by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of $73 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of reduced financial performance driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the modification of certain awards during the first quarter of 2021.\n\n## General and Administrative\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## The success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality employees, including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture and values.\n\nOur success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future office environments or adoption of a new work model that expects employees to work on-site for a specified number of days with some flexibility to work remotely on other days, may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain our employees. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States. We also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success, and we have invested substantial time and resources in building, maintaining and evolving our culture. Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit employees.\n\n## Our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to United States or foreign employment regulations.\n\nWe have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which could have a direct impact on our operating costs. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs. There is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment, health and safety, wage and hour laws, criminal activity, personal injury and other claims. In addition, if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we could be vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Operating a Global Business\n\n## Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business.\n\nVirtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political tensions, unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. Changes in the U.S. government's import and export policies, including trade restrictions, sanctions and countersanctions, increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards or customs restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, disease outbreaks, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, or our costs for manufacturing and procuring materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFurthermore, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as the anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, independent contractors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\n\n## Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\n\nThe principal materials used in our footwear products - natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane films - are locally available to manufacturers. The principal materials used in our apparel products - natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware - are also available in countries where our manufacturing takes\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 18",

Additionally, there was $340 million of additional payroll tax due to our CEO's option exercises from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, a $319 million increase in office, information technology, facilities-related expenses, sales and marketing activities and other costs and an increase of $145 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $72 million was attributable to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.

      "answer": "Over the past year, AMZN saw a significant increase in its consolidated operating income, rising from $12,248 million in 2022 to $36,852 million in 2023, largely driven by strong performance in AWS and North America, while International losses narrowed. GM experienced a decline in operating income from $10,315 million in 2022 to $9,298 million in 2023, indicating some pressure in its automotive segment despite growth in net sales. SBUX reported a decrease in total operating income from $5,870.8 million in fiscal 2023 to $5,408.8 million in fiscal 2024, with declines in North America and International segments offsetting modest gains in Channel Development. Collectively, these trends show AMZN gaining momentum, GM facing margin pressures, and SBUX experiencing a slight contraction in operating profitability.",

      "answer": "GM reported a total accrued liabilities of $20,297 million in 2021, with major components including dealer and customer allowances ($3,211 million) and product warranty liabilities ($3,769 million), indicating a focus on automotive sales and post-sale obligations. NKE had total accrued liabilities of $6,220 million in 2022, with compensation and benefits ($1,297 million) and sales-related reserves ($1,015 million) as key components, reflecting its emphasis on workforce and brand-driven sales. SBUX reported $2,137.1 million in accrued liabilities in 2022, with significant accrued dividends payable ($608.3 million) and capital expenditures ($878.1 million), highlighting its focus on shareholder returns and store-level investments. These differences underscore distinct operational models: GM's dealer-centric and warranty-heavy structure, NKE's sales and compensation focus, and SBUX's capital investment and dividend strategy.",

      "question": "How do GM, MCD, and NKE each quantify or manage the sensitivity of their debt's fair value to interest rate changes, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to interest rate risk management?",
      "answer": "GM discloses that a 10% decrease in quoted interest rates would increase the fair value of its debt and finance leases by $0.7 billion, indicating a moderate sensitivity to interest rate movements. MCD reports that the fair value of its debt obligations was $36.6 billion, below the carrying amount of $38.4 billion, suggesting that its debt portfolio may be less sensitive to interest rate increases. NKE provides a maturity schedule showing that its long-term U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt has an average interest rate of 3.1%, with a fair value of $7,631 million, and also uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure, with a notional amount of $1,800 million. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies manage interest rate exposure, they do so through different instruments and with varying degrees of sensitivity and hedge coverage.",

          "chunk_text": "\nInterest Rate Risk We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments, primarily debt, finance lease obligations and certain marketable debt securities. At December 31, 2024, interest rate swap positions were used to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations and were insignificant. The fair value of debt and finance leases was $15.2 billion and $16.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% decrease in quoted interest rates would have been $0.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nWe had marketable debt securities of $7.3 billion and $7.6 billion classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nCommodity Risk We have commodity price risk which could have an impact of our financial results as result of fluctuations in the prices of commodities used in vehicle production. At December 31, 2024 we used derivative instruments such as commodity forwards, swaps and options to hedge a portion of our exposures with respect to forecasted commodity purchases of steel, copper, aluminum, palladium, lithium and nickel.\n\nThe net fair value liability of financial instruments with ex posure to commodity price movements was insignificant at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The potential change in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been $0.2 billion and insignificant at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, repricing timing and prepayment expectations. Typically, retail finance receivables and leases purchased by GM Financial earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with  variable  or  fix ed  rate  debt.  The  variable  rate  debt  is  subject  to  adjustments  to  reflect  prevailing  market  interest  rates.  To  help  mitigate  interest  rate  risk  or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve. However, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in GM Financial's analysis. Therefore, the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below. These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent GM Financial's view of future interest rate movements.",

The Company's derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, and cross-currency interest rate swaps, and are classified as either fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Further details are explained in the \"Fair V alue,\" \"Cash Flow\" and \"Net Investment\" hedge sections.\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Further details are explained in the 'Undesignated Derivatives' section.\n\nAll deriv ativ es (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments' maturity dates. Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to A OCI and/or current earnings.",

Home Depot also saw a rise in net property and equipment, from $25.631 billion in 2022 to $26.154 billion in 2023, with growth in both U.S. and international holdings. McDonald's showed a significant increase in net property and equipment, rising from $23.7736 billion in 2022 to $24.9076 billion in 2023, primarily due to an increase in property and equipment at cost. These increases suggest that all three companies are continuing to invest in their physical assets, albeit at different scales, to support their operations and growth strategies in the consumer discretionary sector.",

      "question": "How do HD, LOW, and MCD each characterize the trajectory and drivers of their comparable sales growth in 2022, and what does this reveal about the divergent impacts of macroeconomic conditions across the home improvement and fast-food sectors?",
      "answer": "HD reported a 11.4% increase in comparable sales in 2022, driven by a combination of stable customer transactions and a significant rise in average ticket size ($83.04 in 2022 vs. $74.32 in 2020). In contrast, LOW highlighted that macroeconomic factors such as inflation, unemployment, and the lingering effects of the pandemic could negatively impact the growth of comparable sales, particularly in the home improvement sector where consumer spending is discretionary and sensitive to economic downturns. MCD also referenced comparable sales in its 2022 report but did not disclose specific figures, instead focusing on systemwide sales performance, which suggests a different emphasis in communicating sales health. Together, these perspectives reveal that while HD benefited from strong consumer spending in home improvement during 2022, LOW anticipated headwinds from broader economic pressures, and MCD's fast-food model appeared more insulated or focused on system-level growth rather than same-store performance.",

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein.\n\nOur sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy. Adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales. Many U.S. and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance. These include, but are not limited to, periods of slow economic growth or recession, home price appreciation or decreasing housing turnover, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to Lowe's and its customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending, inflation and its impacts on discretionary spending and on our costs, shortages, and other disruptions in the labor supply, consumer debt levels, changes in tax rates and policy, outbreak of pandemics, fluctuations in fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, armed conflicts, and acts of both domestic and international terrorism. Sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects. Adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services.\n\nOur business could be affected by uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, including natural disasters and changes in climate, as well as other catastrophic events, which could impact our operations.\n\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions, such as major or extended winter storms or droughts, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; pandemics and public health concerns; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; civil unrest; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. These types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities. They can also disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. In addition, these events may affect our information systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores. Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures, could render a portion of our inventory damaged or unsellable. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\n\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to the long-term effects of global climate change.\n\nOur business and operations are subject to inherent climate-related risks. These include both physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts, and rising sea levels may impact the areas in which the Company's operations and facilities are located, and they could also affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. Such events could result in an increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue, cash flows and financial performance. Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulations affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. In addition, we also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns.\n\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.\n\nOur business is subject to a wide array of federal, state and local laws and regulations. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change",

BKNG and HD both show increases in their Gross Carrying Amounts year-over-year, while SBUX's total remained relatively flat.

Global Brand Divisions costs represent demand creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Company's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, Corporate included a non-recurring impairment charge, recognized as a result of the Company's decision to transition certain NIKE Brand businesses within APLA to a third-party distributor. This charge primarily reflected the anticipated release of associated non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses. For more information regarding this charge, refer to Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures.\n\nThe primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nAs part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 87",

      "answer": "Home Depot applies the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV) to approximately 38% of its merchandise inventories, primarily using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, and evaluates these inventories quarterly to ensure they are carried at NRV, with adjustments being immaterial. Nike estimates inventory reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions, recording a reserve when NRV is estimated to be less than inventory cost, with such reserves directly impacting cost of sales. Tesla states its inventories at the lower of cost or NRV, computes cost using standard cost (approximating FIFO), and records write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory based on current and future demand forecasts, with any write-downs establishing a new cost basis that cannot be reversed. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies use NRV in inventory valuation, Home Depot emphasizes periodic evaluation with limited material impact, Nike focuses on forward-looking demand assumptions affecting cost of sales, and Tesla takes a more conservative approach by permanently writing down inventory with sensitivity to forecast changes.",

Lowe\u2019s also uses millions as its unit of measure but specifically notes its fiscal year ended January 28, 2022, indicating a retail calendar alignment. Starbucks similarly reports in millions but structures its equity disclosures with an additional specification of per share data, which is less common in automotive or home improvement sectors. These differences highlight how companies in the same sector tailor financial reporting to their operational cycles, stakeholder expectations, and disclosure philosophies, even when adhering to the same accounting standards.",

      "answer": "In 2024, General Motors reported a $0.3 billion decrease in material and freight costs, contributing positively to its cost savings. Nike benefited from lower ocean freight rates and logistics costs, which helped offset gross margin contraction driven by foreign exchange impacts. Tesla included freight as part of its cost of energy generation and storage revenue, indicating ongoing exposure to shipping expenses as a component of its cost structure. Collectively, these insights reveal that while all three companies are impacted by freight costs, they experience and manage this exposure differently\u2014GM through cost reductions, Nike through logistics efficiency, and Tesla through direct inclusion in segment-level cost reporting.",

The remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and product warranty and recall campaigns.\n\nFactors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share and the relative mix of vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. V ariable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. V ehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit.

The majority of our merchandise inv entories are stated at the lower of cost or market, as determined by the retail inv entory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inv entory losses (or shrink). As the inv entory retail v alue is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, inv entory v alued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Our remaining merchandise inv entories, including those within our retail operations in Canada and Mexico, distribution centers, and SRS, are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable v alue, as determined by a cost method, primarily the first-in, first-out method. We evaluate the inv entory v alued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the adjustments recorded to merchandise inv entories v alued under a cost method were not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\n\nPhysical inv entory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in our stores, distribution centers and branches to ensure that amounts reflected in merchandise inv entories are properly stated. Shrink (or in the case of excess inv entory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inv entory and the physical inv entory count. We calculate shrink based on actual inv entory losses identified as a result of physical inv entory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inv entory losses occurring between physical inv entory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inv entory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inv entory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nBuildings and related improv ements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method ov er their estimated useful liv es.

      "answer": "Nike reported lower logistics costs, with ocean freight rates contributing to gross margin improvement, reflecting a favorable offset to other cost pressures. Starbucks highlighted the potential negative impact of rising logistics costs on its supply chain efficiency and operational planning, identifying it as a risk factor in its forward-looking statements. Tesla specifically mentioned lower logistics costs as part of its cost reduction strategy, supporting its efforts to improve production efficiency and vehicle affordability. Together, these perspectives reveal differing exposures and strategic responses to logistics cost fluctuations across the consumer discretionary sector.",

Further, we may finance these strategic transactions by incurring additional debt, which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory and Other E xternal Risks\n\nOur sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy. Adverse changes in macroeconomic factors specific to the home improvement industry have in the past and may in the future negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales. Many macroeconomic factors have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our financial performance. These include, but are not limited to, periods of slow economic growth or recession, home price appreciation or decreasing housing turnover, age of housing stock, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to Lowe's and its customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending, inflation and its impacts on discretionary spending and on our costs, shortages, and other disruptions in the labor supply, the impact of rising interest rates, consumer debt levels, changes in tax  rates and policy, outbreak of pandemics, fluctuations in fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and acts of both domestic and international terrorism. Additionally, in fiscal 2024, we continued to operate in an environment with inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, which has adversely impacted consumer discretionary spending. If cost inflation of merchandise increases beyond our ability to control or respond effectively, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. Sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects. Adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services.\n\nOur business has been and could continue to be affected by uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, as well as other catastrophic events, which could impact our operations.\n\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions, such as major or extended winter storms or droughts, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; pandemics and public health concerns; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; civil unrest; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events could have, and in certain instances in the past had, an adverse effect on our operations or financial performance. These events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. Natural disasters or catastrophic climate events may, and in certain instances in the past has, increased demand for certain of our products, and if we are unable to meet such customer demands, our reputation, business, and financial operations could be harmed, particularly if our responses to such events are less adequate than those of our competitors. These types of events can also adversely affect our workforce and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities. They can also disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. In addition, these events may affect our information systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores. Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures, could render a portion of our inventory damaged or unsellable. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\n\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to the long-term effects of global climate change.\n\nOur business and operations are subject to climate-related risks. These include both physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts, and rising sea levels may impact the areas in which the Company's operations and facilities are located, and they could also affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. Such events could result in an increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue, cash flows, and financial performance. Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulations affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. In addition, we use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns.",

Although we have announced sustainability-related goals and targets, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategies, and any perception, whether or not valid, that we have failed to achieve, or to act responsibly with respect to, such m atters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirem ents regarding clim ate change, could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation. E xecution of these strategies and achievem ent of our goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, m any of which are outside of our control. T hese risks and uncertainties include, but are not lim ited to, our ability to execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected tim efram es; the availability and cost of raw m aterials and renewable energy; unforeseen production, design, operational and technological difficulties; the outcom e of research efforts and future technology developm ents, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a com m ercially com petitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; com pliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, m andates or requirem ents relating to greenhouse gas emissions, carbon costs or clim ate-related goals; adapting products to custom er preferences and custom er acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions; and the actions of competitors and com petitive pressures. As a result, there is no assurance that we will be able to adequately m eet stakeholder expectations, successfully execute our strategies or achieve our sustainability-related goals, which could dam age our reputation and custom er and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\n\nGiven the broad and global scope of our operations, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of clim ate change, such as shifts in weather patterns. E xtrem e weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, m anufacturers, custom ers, distribution centers, offices, headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. M oreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tsunam is, floods or droughts, whether occurring in the U nited States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past tem porarily disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our vendors, m anufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, econom ic instability that m ay negatively im pact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers, m anufacturers, employees, custom ers, distribution centers or vendors are located, our continued success would depend, in part, on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties' com puter, network, telecom m unication and other system s and operations. In addition, a natural disaster or severe weather event could negatively im pact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse im pact on consum er spending, any of which could in turn result in negative point-of-sale trends for our m erchandise. F urther, clim ate change m ay increase both the frequency and severity of extrem e weather conditions and natural disasters, which m ay affect our business operations, either in a particular region or globally, as well as the activities of our third-party vendors and other suppliers, m anufacturers and custom ers. T he diversity of locations in which we operate, our operational size, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our inform ation technology system s and networks, including the I nternet and third-party services (\"Inform ation T echnology System s\"), m ay not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities. If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events, we could experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event m ay affect our hum an capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel. F or exam ple, our W orld H eadquarters is located in a seism ic zone, which is at a higher risk for earthquakes and the related consequences or effects. F urther, if we are unable to find alternative suppliers, replace capacity at key m anufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair dam age to our Inform ation T echnology System s or supply system s, we could be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our custom ers. These events could result in reputational dam age, lost sales, cancellation charges or m arkdowns, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by a pandemic, epidemic or other public health emergency.\n\nPandem ics, including the C O VID -19 pandem ic, and other public health em ergencies, and preventative m easures taken to contain or m itigate such crises have caused, and m ay in the future cause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial m arkets, both globally and in the U nited States. T hese events have led to and could again lead to adverse im pacts to our global supply chain, factory cancellation costs, store closures, and a decline in retail traffic and discretionary spending by consum ers and, in turn, m aterially im pact our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations as well as cause a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the m ix of earnings across our jurisdictions. W e cannot predict whether, and to what degree, our sales, operations and financial results could in the future be affected by the pandem ic and preventative measures.

      "answer": "GM defines ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted over average net assets, adjusted for automotive debt, pension liabilities, and tax assets, emphasizing capital allocation decisions. LOW calculates ROIC using lease-adjusted NOPAT divided by average debt and shareholders' deficit, highlighting its focus on lease-adjusted returns and capital structure efficiency. NKE reports ROIC as a performance measure to evaluate its ability to manage invested capital, though without disclosing a detailed formula, suggesting a more strategic, internally focused application. Together, these approaches show that GM emphasizes operational adjustments, LOW integrates lease economics and capital structure, and NKE uses ROIC as a high-level performance indicator.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

Management believes ROIC is a meaningful metric for analysts and investors as a measure of how effectively the Company is using capital to generate financial returns. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC.  Accordingly, the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies.  We encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate ROIC before comparing its ROIC to ours.\n\nWe define ROIC as the rolling 12 months' lease adjusted net operating profit after tax (Lease adjusted NOPAT) divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and shareholders' deficit. Lease adjusted NOPAT is a non-GAAP financial measure, and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure.

We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper programs, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to invest in the business through capital expenditures, fund dividend payments, fund any share repurchases, make any required debt payments, and satisfy other contractual obligations through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.\n\nOur material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. See below for additional details regarding these material cash requirements.\n\nIn addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. For fiscal 2022, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis, compared to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2021. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, we paid cash dividends of $7.0 billion to shareholders. In February 2022, we also announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.65 to $1.90 per share. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.",

Our prim ary foreign currency exposures arise from  the recording of transactions denom inated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denom inated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U .S. D ollars.\n\nOur foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program  is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. W e m anage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks m aterial to N IKE , Inc. W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and m aterial, by hedging a portion of the rem aining exposures using derivative instrum ents such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the im plem entation of the N IKE  T rading C om pany (\"N T C \") and our foreign currency adjustm ent program  enhanced our ability to m anage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the im pact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. W here exposures are hedged, our program  has the effect of delaying the im pact of exchange rate m ovem ents on our C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instrum ents for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 44",

      "answer": "AMZN discusses a decrease in the significance of finance lease assets, noting that finance lease costs are amortized over the shorter of the asset's useful life or the lease term, and that the interest component is recognized using the effective interest method. HD explicitly discloses $2,896 million in finance lease assets as of January 30, 2022, representing a meaningful portion of its net property and equipment. SBUX, in contrast, states that its finance lease assets were immaterial as of October 2, 2022, indicating minimal reliance on finance leases. This reveals that AMZN is reducing its reliance on finance leases, HD maintains a moderate level of finance lease exposure, and SBUX largely avoids this form of asset financing, reflecting differing capital structure strategies across the three companies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.\n\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\n\n## Financing Obligations\n\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.\n\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\n\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See 'Note 5 - Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.'\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $6.8 billion and $10.7 billion.",

Tesla explicitly includes freight in both its Automotive and Energy Generation and Storage segments as part of cost of sales, alongside other direct and indirect costs, showing a transparent and segmented approach to tracking freight as a variable expense.

The majority of our merchandise inv entories are stated at the lower of cost or market, as determined by the retail inv entory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inv entory losses (or shrink). As the inv entory retail v alue is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, inv entory v alued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Our remaining merchandise inv entories, including those within our retail operations in Canada and Mexico, distribution centers, and SRS, are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable v alue, as determined by a cost method, primarily the first-in, first-out method. We evaluate the inv entory v alued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the adjustments recorded to merchandise inv entories v alued under a cost method were not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\n\nPhysical inv entory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in our stores, distribution centers and branches to ensure that amounts reflected in merchandise inv entories are properly stated. Shrink (or in the case of excess inv entory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inv entory and the physical inv entory count. We calculate shrink based on actual inv entory losses identified as a result of physical inv entory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inv entory losses occurring between physical inv entory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inv entory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inv entory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nBuildings and related improv ements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method ov er their estimated useful liv es. Leasehold improv ements and assets held under finance leases are amortized using the straight-line method ov er the original term of the lease or the useful life of the asset, whichev er is shorter.\n\nThe following table presents the estimated useful liv es of our property and equipment:\n\n",

MCD emphasizes its strategic focus on digital transformation, including building a global consumer platform to enhance engagement and efficiency, suggesting that online and digital channels are a core part of its growth strategy. In contrast, NKE experienced an 8% decline in digital sales during fiscal 2024, which offset gains from new store openings and comparable store sales, signaling a potential challenge in its digital channel performance.

Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking or conditional words, such as 'could,' 'should,' 'can,' 'continue,' 'aim,' 'estimate,' 'forecast,' 'intend,' 'look,' 'may,' 'will,' 'ex pect,' 'believ e,' 'anticipate,' 'plan,' 'remain,' 'confident,' 'commit,' 'enable,' 'potential' and \"trajectory \" or similar ex pressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. They reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the dates the statements are made. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update such forward-looking statements. Y ou should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.\n\n## Risk F actors\n\nOur business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. A dditional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly adversely affect our business. If any of these risks were to materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies - including the components of our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy - must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's continued ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, including by maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu items, and doubling down on digital, delivery, drive thru and restaurant development;\n- innovate and differentiate the M cDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- build upon our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including building one of the world's largest consumer platforms to fuel engagement;\n- run great restaurants by building the easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform which enables franchisees to run restaurants more efficiently  and utiliz e the latest cloud-based technology  to make it easier for crews to deliv er ex ceptional customer service;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and building a modern company platform that unlocks speed and innovation throughout the organization; and\n- evolve and adjust our strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, and other events impacting our results of operations and liquidity.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in evolving or executing against our strategies, if the execution of our strategies proves to be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value or relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo continue to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value and relevance of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at M cDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which continuously evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, as well as by our perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. In addition, we cannot ensure that franchisees or business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.\n\nIf we do not anticipate and address industry trends and evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and industry trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to the use of digital channels and environmental and social responsibility matters. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors are\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 28",

          "chunk_text": "## Contingencies\n\nLoss contingencies (other than income tax-related contingencies) arise from actual or possible claims and assessments and pending or threatened litigation that may be brought against the Company by individuals, governments or other entities. Based on the Company's assessment of loss contingencies at each balance sheet date, a loss is recorded in the financial statements if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company historically determined that its primary brands constituted its operating segments. In 2019, reflecting changes to the management structure, the Company reorganized its operating segments from six to four operating segments by combining Booking.com with Rentalcars.com and KAYAK with OpenTable. The Company's Booking.com and Rentalcars.com operating segment represents a substantial majority of the Company's total revenues and operating income. The Company's operating segments continue to be aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similarity in economic characteristics, other qualitative factors and the objectives and principles of ASC 280, Segment Reporting. For geographic information, see Note 18.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\n\n## Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued a new accounting update relating to income taxes. This update provides an exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. This update also (1) requires an entity to recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax, (2) requires an entity to evaluate when a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which goodwill was originally recognized for accounting purposes and when it should be considered a separate transaction, and (3) requires that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe Company adopted this update on January 1, 2021 and applied the applicable amendments on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Accounting for Acquired Revenue Contracts with Customers in a Business Combination\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting update that requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , rather than at fair value on the acquisition date as required under current U.S. GAAP. The Company early adopted this update during the fourth quarter of 2021 and applied it retrospectively to all business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2021.\n\n## Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued a new accounting update relating to convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity. For convertible instruments, the accounting update reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current U.S. GAAP. The accounting update amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions.\n\nThe Company adopted this update on January 1, 2022 on a modified retrospective basis, which resulted in an increase of approximately $30 million to retained earnings. For the Company's convertible debt instruments, interest expense for the periods beginning after January 1, 2022 will be reflected in the financial statements using interest rates that typically are closer to the coupon interest rate of such instruments rather than a generally higher imputed interest expense that resulted from the separation of conversion features required by previous U.S. GAAP. See Note 12 for additional information on the Company's convertible debt instruments. The accounting update also requires changes in the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas, including the use of the if-converted method instead of the treasury stock method which was permitted in certain situations under current U.S. GAAP. See Note 8 for additional information on earnings per share.",

Topic 832 requires disclosure of the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item, and significant terms of the transactions. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-10 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nASU 2020-04. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,' which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. These amendments are not applicable to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. ASU No. 2020-04 is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and may be applied to contract modifications and hedging relationships from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. While the discontinuance of LIBOR will impact our interest rate swap agreements and certain of our credit arrangements, we do not anticipate the transition to a new reference rate and adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nRecent accounting pronouncements adopted or pending adoption not discussed above are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## 2. NET SALES AND SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nWe currently conduct our retail operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents one of our three operating segments. Our operating segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is used to make decisions and allocate resources. For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three operating segments into one reportable segment due to their similar operating and financial characteristics.\n\nThe following table presents net property and equipment, classified by geography:\n\n",

Starbucks notes that unfavorable economic conditions could lead to increased bad debt expense due to financial hardships faced by suppliers and licensees, including potential insolvencies. Tesla, while not directly referencing bad debt expense, discusses risks related to customer defaults on payments, particularly in its energy generation and storage business, where decreases in electricity prices could make its products less attractive and increase default rates. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to credit risk under economic stress, Nike and Starbucks explicitly link this to bad debt expense and retail/counterparty insolvency, whereas Tesla focuses more on customer payment defaults tied to product economics.",

      "answer": "Home Depot is expanding its tool rental service by investing in more locations, tools, and technology, indicating a focus on enhancing customer experience and service differentiation. Nike highlights the addition of new stores as part of its NIKE Direct growth strategy, which contributed to a 25% increase in NIKE Direct revenues and 17% comparable store sales growth, showing a strategic shift toward direct-to-consumer expansion. Starbucks plans to invest approximately $2.5 billion in fiscal 2023 for new and existing stores, supply chain, and corporate facilities, signaling a strong commitment to physical footprint expansion and infrastructure modernization. Together, these approaches reveal distinct strategies: Home Depot focuses on service innovation, Nike on DTC retail expansion, and Starbucks on infrastructure and store-level scalability.",

We also provide tool and equipment rentals at over 1,400 locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both Pros and consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering, we are continuing to invest in more locations, more tools, and better technology.\n\nSourcing and Quality Assurance. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During fiscal 2021, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam and Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility, we also have a global responsible sourcing program. Under our supplier contracts, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. These contracts also require compliance with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environment, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. To drive accountability with our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement includes a factory audit right related to these standards, and we conduct factory audits and compliance visits with our suppliers of private branded and direct import products. Our 2021 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility, provides more information about this program. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our private branded products.\n\nIntellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, ecommerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our proprietary brands such as HDX , Husky , Hampton Bay , Home Decorators Collection , Glacier Bay , Vigoro , Everbilt and Lifeproof . The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail services and products and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our business. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nOur industry is highly competitive, very fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. These competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face.\n\nWe compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options, both in-store and online. We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Furthermore, with respect to delivery options, customers are increasingly seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options, including curbside pickup. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain investments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter.",

NIKE Direct revenues increased 25%, driven by strong digital sales growth of 30%, comparable store sales growth of 17% and the addition of new stores.\n\nFootwear revenues increased 5% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in NIKE Direct, partially offset by a decline in our wholesale business. Unit sales of footwear decreased 4%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 9 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct ASP, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues increased 9%, driven primarily by higher revenues in Men's. Unit sales of apparel decreased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 11 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nReported EBIT remained flat as higher revenues were offset by higher selling and administrative expense and gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased approximately 10 basis points, largely due to higher product and other costs, partially offset by higher margins and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, a higher mix of full-price sales and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, primarily due to strategic pricing actions. Higher product and other costs were primarily due to increased freight, logistics and warehousing costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily as a result of higher advertising and marketing expense, as well as higher digital marketing investments. The increase in operating overhead expense reflected higher wage-related costs as well as an increase in NIKE Direct variable costs.",

MCD discloses that the dilutive effect of share-based compensation under the treasury stock method was 4.4 million shares in 2023, which is factored into its diluted weighted-average shares calculation.

Changes in foreign ex change rates reduced cost of sales by $1.7 billion in 2024.\n\nShipping costs were $89.5 billion and $95.8 billion in 2023 and 2024. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\n\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as 'Technology and infrastructure' as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\n\n## Fulfillment\n\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs.

Refer to Note 9, Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nTo reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated royalty revenue, inventory purchases, and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect net earnings.\n\nFrom time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to hedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Gains and losses from these derivatives, representing hedged components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are amortized over the life of the hedging instrument using a systematic and rational method and recognized in interest expense.\n\nForeign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance sheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and receivables, and these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net.\n\n## Commodities\n\nDepending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts, and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-befix ed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5, Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and priceto-be-fix ed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\n\nDepending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our dairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\n\nCash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions are no longer probable of occurring or where price variability in the underlying cash flow ceases to exist, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. These derivatives may be accounted for prospectively as non-designated derivatives until maturity, re-designated to new hedging relationships, or terminated early. We continue to believe transactions related to our designated cash flow hedges are probable to occur.\n\nTo mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures, and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging, and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.",

In contrast, TSLA actively reduces logistics costs through localized procurement and manufacturing strategies, which are integral to lowering production expenses and improving vehicle affordability.

      "answer": "Amazon includes rent as part of its fulfillment costs, which also include facilities, staffing, and supply chain management expenses, indicating a heavy investment in logistics and physical infrastructure. McDonald's, on the other hand, sees rent as a revenue driver\u2014franchisees pay rent based on a percentage of sales, contributing to the company's stable and predictable income. Nike discloses rent as part of its operating overhead expenses, grouped with depreciation, professional services, and wage-related costs, suggesting a more generalized overhead treatment rather than a direct operational cost driver. The contrast in how each company relates to rent reflects Amazon\u2019s asset-heavy fulfillment model, McDonald's asset-light franchising model, and Nike\u2019s brand and administrative focus.",

      "answer": "BKNG defines its operating segments based on brand and management structure, historically reducing from six to four segments in 2019, and continues to aggregate them into one reportable segment due to similar economic characteristics. HD operates in three geographic regions\u2014U.S., Canada, and Mexico\u2014each considered an operating segment, and aggregates them into one reportable segment due to similar operating and financial characteristics. NKE provides detailed segment reporting under Note 17, indicating a structured disclosure framework for operating segments, though the specific segmentation structure is not detailed in the provided excerpt. Together, these approaches reveal varying levels of geographic and structural segmentation, with differing degrees of aggregation for external reporting.",

Based on the Company's assessment of loss contingencies at each balance sheet date, a loss is recorded in the financial statements if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company historically determined that its primary brands constituted its operating segments. In 2019, reflecting changes to the management structure, the Company reorganized its operating segments from six to four operating segments by combining Booking.com with Rentalcars.com and KAYAK with OpenTable. The Company's Booking.com and Rentalcars.com operating segment represents a substantial majority of the Company's total revenues and operating income. The Company's operating segments continue to be aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similarity in economic characteristics, other qualitative factors and the objectives and principles of ASC 280, Segment Reporting. For geographic information, see Note 18.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\n\n## Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued a new accounting update relating to income taxes. This update provides an exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. This update also (1) requires an entity to recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax, (2) requires an entity to evaluate when a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which goodwill was originally recognized for accounting purposes and when it should be considered a separate transaction, and (3) requires that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe Company adopted this update on January 1, 2021 and applied the applicable amendments on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Accounting for Acquired Revenue Contracts with Customers in a Business Combination\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting update that requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , rather than at fair value on the acquisition date as required under current U.S. GAAP. The Company early adopted this update during the fourth quarter of 2021 and applied it retrospectively to all business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2021.\n\n## Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued a new accounting update relating to convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity. For convertible instruments, the accounting update reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current U.S. GAAP. The accounting update amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions.\n\nThe Company adopted this update on January 1, 2022 on a modified retrospective basis, which resulted in an increase of approximately $30 million to retained earnings. For the Company's convertible debt instruments, interest expense for the periods beginning after January 1, 2022 will be reflected in the financial statements using interest rates that typically are closer to the coupon interest rate of such instruments rather than a generally higher imputed interest expense that resulted from the separation of conversion features required by previous U.S. GAAP. See Note 12 for additional information on the Company's convertible debt instruments. The accounting update also requires changes in the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas, including the use of the if-converted method instead of the treasury stock method which was permitted in certain situations under current U.S. GAAP. See Note 8 for additional information on earnings per share.",

Topic 832 requires disclosure of the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item, and significant terms of the transactions. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-10 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nASU 2020-04. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,' which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. These amendments are not applicable to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. ASU No. 2020-04 is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and may be applied to contract modifications and hedging relationships from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. While the discontinuance of LIBOR will impact our interest rate swap agreements and certain of our credit arrangements, we do not anticipate the transition to a new reference rate and adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nRecent accounting pronouncements adopted or pending adoption not discussed above are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## 2. NET SALES AND SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nWe currently conduct our retail operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents one of our three operating segments. Our operating segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is used to make decisions and allocate resources. For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three operating segments into one reportable segment due to their similar operating and financial characteristics.\n\nThe following table presents net property and equipment, classified by geography:\n\n",

MCD discusses amendments as part of its disclosure policy, noting that it posts amendments to SEC filings on its investor website promptly, emphasizing investor communication and regulatory compliance.

These figures highlight significant differences in how each company structures its corporate-level activities, with AMZN having the highest corporate revenue, suggesting a more centralized or diversified corporate function, while GM maintains a much smaller corporate footprint, and NKE shows a corporate expense, indicating investment or losses at the corporate level.",

      "answer": "Nike reports that lower product input costs, particularly ocean freight and logistics, partially offset higher raw material costs, contributing to a 220 basis point expansion in gross margin. Starbucks notes that rising raw material costs, along with regulatory and tax pressures, have negatively impacted its business and financial performance. Tesla highlights that inflation in raw material pricing has created challenges in its supply chain and production, affecting cost control and profitability. These perspectives reveal that Nike has been more successful in mitigating raw material cost pressures through logistics optimization, while Starbucks faces broader cost headwinds including regulatory taxes, and Tesla struggles with supply chain volatility and cost inflation in scaling production.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE \u2192 Raw Material Costs: Nike experienced higher product input costs but offset them through lower ocean freight and logistics costs, resulting in gross margin expansion of 220 basis points.",
        "Hop 2: SBUX \u2192 Raw Material Costs: Starbucks states that increases in raw material costs, combined with new regulatory and tax burdens, have adversely impacted its financial performance and business operations.",
        "Hop 3: TSLA \u2192 Raw Material Costs: Tesla notes that inflation in raw material pricing has created challenges in managing production costs and supply chain efficiency, affecting its ability to meet cost and profitability targets."

TSLA provides data on leased assets obtained through finance lease liabilities, reporting $486 million in 2022.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.\n\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\n\n## Financing Obligations\n\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.\n\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\n\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See 'Note 5 - Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.'\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $6.8 billion and $10.7 billion.",

When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\n\n## Operating Risks\n\n## Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\n\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\n\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\n\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\n\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:\n\n- our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands;\n- our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;\n- our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\n- the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;\n- changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;\n- timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;\n- the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;\n- the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;\n- the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;\n- variations in the mix of products and services we sell;\n- variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;\n- the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;\n- factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related to sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics);\n- the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories;\n- increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products;\n- constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;\n- the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;\n- our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;\n- the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings;",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013 framework) and our report dated February 2, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included  evaluating  the  accounting principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to  the  financial  statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the  financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we  are  not,  by communicating  the  critical  audit  matters  below,  providing  separate  opinions  on  the  critical  audit  matters  or  on  the  accounts  or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Product warranty and recall campaigns\n\n## Description of the matter\n\nAs discussed in Note 12 to the financial statements, the liabilities for product warranty and recall campaigns amount to $9.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company accrues for costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and accrues the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\n\nAuditing  these  liabilities  involved  a  high  degree  of  subjectivity  in  evaluating  management's estimates, due to the size, uncertainties, and potential volatility related to the estimated liabilities. Management's estimates consider historical claims experience, including the nature, frequency, and average  cost  of  claims  of  each  vehicle  line  or  each  model  year  of  the  vehicle  line,  and  the  key assumptions  of  historical  data  being  predictive  of  future  activity  and  events,  in  particular,  the number of historical periods used and the weighing of historical data in the reserve studies.",

NKE accounts for long-term debt at adjusted cost, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and discloses the fair value of its long-term debt as $8,933 million as of May 31, 2022.

      "answer": "BKNG reports finance lease obligations of $36 million in 2024, declining to $0 by 2026, indicating minimal reliance on finance leases. MCD, in contrast, has consistent finance lease payments of around $80 million annually through 2028, suggesting a more sustained use of financed assets. TSLA shows significantly higher finance lease obligations, with $418 million in 2024 declining to $2 million by 2028, pointing to a more aggressive leasing strategy early in the period. This contrast suggests that TSLA is more reliant on finance leases for asset acquisition, while BKNG is the least dependent, and MCD maintains a steady approach.",

      "answer": "Lowe's (LOW) emphasizes its extensive retail footprint with 1,746 stores across the U.S., indicating a focus on physical retail infrastructure as a core asset. Nike (NKE) highlights cybersecurity risks tied to its retail operations, underscoring a proactive governance structure involving executive leadership and board-level oversight to manage digital threats. Starbucks (SBUX) discusses supply chain and commodity price risks, particularly in coffee sourcing, which indirectly affects its retail segment through cost volatility and supply reliability. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies rely heavily on their retail segments, they prioritize different risk categories\u2014LOW focuses on physical retail scale, NKE on digital security, and SBUX on supply chain and commodity exposure.",

      "answer": "GM adjusts EBIT for impairment charges, recall-related costs, and currency devaluations, indicating a focus on strategic and one-time impacts. HD reports EBIT as $23,040 million in fiscal 2022, showing strong operational performance with gross profit at 33.6% of net sales. SBUX reports operating income of $4,617.8 million in fiscal 2022, with restructuring and impairments at $46.0 million, indicating tighter cost control compared to prior years. Together, this reveals that GM is more exposed to non-recurring items, HD benefits from high gross margins, and SBUX focuses on streamlining operating costs to protect EBIT.",

For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  consolidated diluted  EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares  outstanding-diluted.  Examples  of  income  tax  adjustments  include  the  establishment  or  reversal  of  significant  deferred  tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our  core  operations  on  a  consistent  basis.  ETR-adjusted  is  calculated  as  Income  tax  expense  less  the  income  tax  related  to  the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before  income  taxes  less  adjustments. When  we  provide  an  expected  adjusted  effective  tax  rate,  we  do  not  provide  an  expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  investment  and  capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review  the  liquidity  of  our  automotive  operations  and  to  measure  and  monitor  our  performance  against  our  capital  allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted  automotive  free  cash  flow  as  automotive  operating  cash  flow  from  operations  less  capital  expenditures  adjusted  for management actions.  Management  actions  can  include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "question": "How did fluctuations in raw material costs impact the gross margin performance of The Home Depot (HD), Nike (NKE), and Starbucks (SBUX) in fiscal 2023, and what does this reveal about their respective cost management strategies and pricing power?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, The Home Depot (HD) noted that rising raw material costs negatively impacted its financial performance, signaling pressure on margins. In contrast, Nike (NKE) reported that while product input costs increased, the company managed to expand gross margins by 220 basis points, largely due to strategic pricing actions and a higher mix of NIKE Direct sales. Starbucks (SBUX) faced rising costs from regulatory-driven taxes on product ingredients and packaging, which also negatively impacted its financial performance. This reveals that Nike was more effective in mitigating raw material cost pressures through pricing and direct-to-consumer strategies, whereas HD and SBUX were more vulnerable to cost increases, with SBUX additionally facing regulatory cost burdens.",

SBUX, in contrast, notes that its finance lease assets were immaterial in 2023, indicating a preference for other forms of asset financing or ownership.

MCD reports $1,597 billion in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2023 as part of its total restaurant margins, indicating significant fixed asset investment in its company-operated locations. SBUX shows a rise in depreciation and amortization expenses from $1,362.6 million in fiscal 2023 to $1,512.6 million in fiscal 2024, primarily in North America and international segments, reflecting ongoing capital investments in stores and infrastructure.

BKNG discusses the presentation of excess tax benefits as a discrete item in the income statement upon vesting or exercise of stock awards, though it does not quantify the benefit. TSLA highlights the relevance of excess tax benefits in evaluating the realizability of U.S. deferred tax assets but maintains a full valuation allowance, indicating uncertainty in benefiting from these tax deductions in the near term.

Marketing expenses consist of performance marketing expenses and brand marketing expenses. Performance marketing expenses are expenses generally measured by return on investment or an increase in bookings over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) offline and online brand marketing; and (5) other performance-based marketing and incentives. Performance marketing expenses are recognized as incurred. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued performance marketing liabilities of $306 million and $156 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Brand marketing expenses are expenses incurred to build brand awareness over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of television advertising and online video and display advertising (including the airing of the Company's television advertising online), as well as other marketing expenses such as public relations and sponsorships. Brand marketing expenses are generally recognized as incurred with the exception of advertising production costs, which are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is displayed or broadcast.\n\n## Sales and Other Expenses\n\nSales and other expenses are generally variable in nature and consist primarily of: (1) credit cards and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations, and other services; (3) chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions; (4) customer relations costs; and (5) provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables and prepayments to certain customers.\n\n## Personnel\n\nPersonnel expenses consist of compensation to the Company's personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health and other benefits. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued compensation liabilities of $421 million and $333 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to performance share units, restricted stock units and stock options is recognized based on fair value on a straight-line basis over the respective requisite service periods and forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. The fair value on the grant date of performance share units and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of units granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock. For performance share units with market conditions, the effect of the market condition is also considered in the determination of fair value on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. The fair value of employee stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model.\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards using its estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets or performance goals, as applicable). The Company periodically adjusts the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results or expected achievement of performance goals, as applicable.\n\nThe benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs are recognized in the income statement as a discrete item when an option exercise or a vesting and release of shares occurs. Excess tax benefits are presented as operating cash flows and cash payments for employee statutory tax withholding related to vested stock awards are presented as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information related to stock-based awards.",

The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $6.14 billion, $974 million, and $150 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to additional U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year. We have $417 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. We did not have any material releases of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We continue to monitor the realizability of the U.S. deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors. In completing this assessment, we considered both objective and subjective factors. These factors included, but were not limited to, a history of losses in prior years, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, future reversal of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. After evaluating all available evidence, we intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Given the improvement in our operating results and depending on the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future, we may release the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. deferred tax assets in the next few years. Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.\n\nThe reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\n\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\n\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\n\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\n\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\n\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and distribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\n\n## Return Allowances\n\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in 'Accrued expenses and other' and were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $5.2 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Included in 'Inventories' on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $948 million, $992 million, and $998 million as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in 'Fulfillment' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Vendor Agreements\n\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.",

G overnm ent shutdowns or the risk of governm ent shutdowns, as well as the im pact or expected im pact of elections, both in the U nited States and in other countries around the world, m ay also increase volatility. Additionally, there has been, and m ay continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates that im pact the U .S. D ollar value relative to other international currencies. O ur international revenues and expenses generally are derived from  sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations, specifically am ounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U .S. D ollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U .S. D ollar adversely affects the U .S. D ollar value of the C om pany's foreign currency-denom inated sales and earnings. C urrency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent m anufacturers that produce our products by m aking their purchases of raw m aterials m ore expensive and m ore difficult to finance. F oreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to com pletely elim inate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative im pact of a stronger U .S. D ollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive im pact of a weaker U .S. D ollar or other trading currency. O ur future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected by the value of the U .S. D ollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given tim e period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale customers.\n\nWe extend credit to our custom ers based on an assessm ent of a custom er's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. T o assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain custom ers the opportunity to place orders five to six m onths ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program . T hese advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with econom ic uncertainty. In the past, som e custom ers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. W hen the retail econom y weakens or as consum er behavior shifts, retailers tend to be m ore cautious with orders. A slowing or changing econom y in our key m arkets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our custom ers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. I n addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality m erchandising and an appealing retail environm ent to attract consum ers, which requires continuing investm ents by retailers. R etailers that experience financial difficulties m ay fail to m ake such investm ents or delay them , resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.\n\n## Climate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nThere are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atm osphere have caused, and m ay continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate, increases in global tem peratures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extrem e weather and clim ate events. C lim ate change m ay also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw m aterials, including those used in the production of our products, and m ay result in changes in regulations or consum er preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. F or exam ple, there has been increased focus by governm ental and nongovernm ental organizations, consum ers, custom ers, em ployees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably m ade and other sustainability m atters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and m aterials transparency, any of which m ay require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local governm ental authorities in various countries are im plem enting, have proposed and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or m itigate the im pacts of clim ate change on the environm ent. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of clim ate change, which could increase the com plexity of, and potential cost related to com plying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing m ay require us to m ake additional investm ents in facilities and equipm ent, m ay im pact the availability and cost of key raw m aterials used in the production of our products or the dem and for our products, and, in turn, m ay adversely im pact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nI nvestors, regulators and other stakeholders are also increasingly scrutinizing com panies' environm ental, social and governance ('E SG ') com m itm ents, perform ance and disclosures, including related to clim ate change, and in recent years have placed increasing im portance on social costs and related im plications of their investm ents.

      "answer": "AMZN reports that excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation contributed $1.4 billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.9 billion to its tax provision in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, and notes that these benefits helped offset increases in pretax income. SBUX shows a decreasing trend in the benefit from excess tax benefits, with impacts of (0.5)%, (0.9)%, and (4.2)% on its effective tax rate in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, indicating a reduced reliance or availability of such benefits. TSLA, while not providing a direct dollar figure, highlights that excess tax benefits are a factor in its evaluation of U.S. deferred tax assets, particularly in relation to potential future valuation allowance releases. The differences suggest that AMZN consistently benefits from large, stable stock-based compensation tax incentives, SBUX has seen a decline in such benefits, and TSLA considers these benefits in a broader context of deferred tax asset realizability rather than immediate tax reduction.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

        "Hop 3: TSLA \u2192 Excess Tax Benefits: TSLA references excess tax benefits as part of its broader analysis of deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, indicating a more strategic, forward-looking consideration rather than immediate benefit realization."

The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $6.14 billion, $974 million, and $150 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to additional U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year. We have $417 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. We did not have any material releases of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We continue to monitor the realizability of the U.S. deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors. In completing this assessment, we considered both objective and subjective factors. These factors included, but were not limited to, a history of losses in prior years, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, future reversal of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. After evaluating all available evidence, we intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Given the improvement in our operating results and depending on the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future, we may release the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. deferred tax assets in the next few years. Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.\n\nThe reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in millions):\n\n",

LOW defines its retail segment as a unified home improvement operating segment, where the CEO evaluates performance using consolidated net earnings and significant segment expenses to guide strategic decisions. SBUX measures its retail segment through net revenues and operating income, with segment-specific assets including cash, property, and goodwill, and focuses on geographic diversification beyond the U.S. and China, particularly in Japan, Canada, and the U.K. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies operate in the retail segment, AMZN prioritizes competitive agility and customer experience, LOW focuses on integrated omnichannel performance metrics, and SBUX emphasizes geographic revenue diversification and segmented financial transparency.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Competition\n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, virtual assistants, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure, tools and services relating to artificial intelligence, and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, communications, and other electronic devices and services; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats; and (10) providers of virtual or inperson healthcare services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 1,556,000 fulltime and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nWe strive to be Earth's best employer. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement this objective and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible employees). Over 240,000 Amazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at Amazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

The Company's chief operating decision maker (CODM) is the Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM has the ultimate decision-making authority for resource allocation and assessing the performance of the Company. Thereby, the CODM regularly reviews consolidated net earnings as the measure of segment profit or loss, as well as significant segment expenses included in the below table, to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. The CODM also uses these measures in monitoring plan versus actual results.

TSLA discloses a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.51 years for all outstanding options and 3.50 years for vested and expected-to-vest options, reflecting a mid-term vesting profile that balances near- and medium-term incentive alignment.

Starbucks reports long-term investments totaling $247.3 million, primarily in available-for-sale debt securities, including corporate debt ($91.1M), mortgage-backed securities ($50.2M), and U.S. Treasury securities ($104.7M), all categorized under Level 2 or Level 1 fair value measurements. Collectively, Lowe\u2019s focuses on contingent investment outcomes tied to divestitures, McDonald\u2019s emphasizes hedging long-term international investment exposure, and Starbucks maintains a conservative, fixed-income-heavy portfolio, suggesting differing capital risk tolerances and strategic priorities.",

      "answer": "GM explains that both basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated using weighted-average common shares outstanding, with dilutive securities such as stock incentive plan awards factoring into the diluted calculation. NKE reports a decline in weighted average common shares outstanding from 1,578.8 million in 2022 to 1,517.6 million in 2024, indicating potential share repurchases, while also noting a smaller dilutive effect from stock options, decreasing from 32.0 million to 12.1 million over the same period. SBUX shows a similar trend with weighted average common shares outstanding decreasing from 1,153.3 million in 2022 to 1,133.8 million in 2024, and a reduced dilutive effect from 5.2 million to 3.5 million. Collectively, this suggests that all three companies have been reducing share counts through buybacks, while also experiencing declining dilution from equity compensation, which supports higher basic and diluted EPS figures.",

SBUX discloses that approximately $2.7 billion of its cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries as of October 2, 2022.

We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper programs, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to invest in the business through capital expenditures, fund dividend payments, fund any share repurchases, make any required debt payments, and satisfy other contractual obligations through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.\n\nOur material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. See below for additional details regarding these material cash requirements.\n\nIn addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. For fiscal 2022, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis, compared to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2021. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, we paid cash dividends of $7.0 billion to shareholders. In February 2022, we also announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.65 to $1.90 per share. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.",

Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business.\n\nCorporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2022, or 7%, compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2021. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($84 million), increased support costs to address labor market conditions ($36 million) and increased partner wages and benefits ($31 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($62 million).\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## Cash and Investment Overview\n\nOur cash and investments were $3.5 billion and $6.9 billion as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of October 2, 2022, approximately $2.7 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Borrowing capacity\n\n## Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper\n\nOur total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $2.8 billion as of the end of fiscal 2022.\n\n## Revolving Lines of Credit\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the '2021 credit facility'), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The 'Base Rate' of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America's prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1.000%. As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings under the 2021 credit facility.\n\n## Commercial Paper\n\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the",

      "answer": "BKNG recognizes operating lease costs for office space and data centers, combining fixed lease payments with non-lease charges like maintenance, and applies straight-line recognition over the lease term. NKE reports operating lease costs of $618 million for fiscal 2024, with variable lease costs adding $433 million, showing a significant but consistent expense over recent years. SBUX discloses operating lease costs of $1,723.5 million for the most recent fiscal year, representing a large portion of its total lease costs of $2,881.0 million. Comparing these figures, SBUX has the highest absolute operating lease cost, followed by NKE and BKNG, suggesting differing degrees of reliance on leased assets and varied accounting treatments, with implications for financial flexibility and operational footprint.",

      "answer": "GM reported a total net carrying amount of $2,941 million as of December 31, 2023, with notable components including Brands at $2,526 million. HD showed a significantly higher net carrying amount of $3,606 million as of January 28, 2024, driven largely by customer relationships valued at $2,755 million. SBUX, on the other hand, had a much smaller net carrying amount of $21.4 million as of September 29, 2023, with trade names and trademarks at $20.4 million. These differences highlight distinct approaches: GM and HD rely heavily on customer and brand-related intangibles, while SBUX's amortization practices result in near-zero net values for many key assets, suggesting a more aggressive write-down strategy.",

      "question": "How do BKNG, MCD, and NKE each characterize the composition and year-over-year changes in their 'Other (income) expense, net' line items, and what do these differences suggest about their exposure to non-operational financial gains and losses?",
      "answer": "BKNG reports a significant net loss in 'Other income (expense), net' of $697 million in 2022, driven largely by losses on equity securities and early debt extinguishment. MCD shows a more modest 'Other expense' of $14 million in 2021, with foreign currency and hedging activity playing a mixed role. NKE, in contrast, shifted from $14 million in expense in fiscal 2021 to $181 million in net income in fiscal 2022, primarily due to favorable foreign currency conversion and hedges, along with a one-time charge from the deconsolidation of Russian operations. These differences suggest BKNG is more exposed to investment-related volatility, MCD maintains a relatively stable non-operational expense profile, and NKE experiences significant swings tied to foreign exchange and strategic restructuring.",

      "answer": "Home Depot reported that an increase in average ticket was a primary driver of a $19.0 billion rise in net sales in fiscal 2021, indicating a strong positive correlation between ticket size and revenue growth in the home improvement sector. Lowe's defines average ticket as net sales divided by total customer transactions, highlighting its importance as a performance metric, though it does not quantify its specific impact on sales growth. In contrast, Starbucks experienced a 4% decrease in average ticket, which contributed to a 9% decline in comparable store sales, largely due to pandemic-related disruptions in China. This contrast reveals that while a rising average ticket supports growth in retail sectors like home improvement, a decline can significantly hinder performance in the food service industry, especially under external pressures like global health crises.",

Sales per retail square foot is a measure of the efficiency of sales based on the total square footage of our stores and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company's retail operations as an indicator of the productivity of owned and leased square footage for these retail operations.\n\n## Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\n\nSales. We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales.\n\nNet Sales. Net sales for fiscal 2021 increased $19.0 billion, or 14.4%, to $151.2 billion. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2021 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable average ticket, as well as sales from HD Supply, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, we saw continued elevated home improvement demand, which began at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020, with strong performance across our departments as customers continued to focus on home improvement projects and repairs. A weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted sales growth by $760 million in fiscal 2021.",

A location that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable in the month of its relocation.  The relocated location must then remain open longer than 13 months to be considered comparable.  A location we have decided to close is no longer considered comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing. Comparable sales include online sales, which positively impacted the comparable sales increase in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019 by approximately 150 basis points, 565 basis points, and 25 basis points, respectively. 1\n\nAverage ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions. 2\n\nAverage store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period. The average Lowe's-branded home improvement store has approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space. 3\n\n- Return on average assets is defined as net earnings divided by average total assets for the last five quarters. 4\n\nReturn on invested capital is calculated using a non-GAAP financial measure. Net earnings to average debt and shareholders' (deficit)/equity is the most comparable GAAP ratio. See below for additional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures. 5\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n## Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating what management considers the Company's core financial performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of discrete items, further described below, not contemplated in the Company's business outlook for fiscal 2020. Unless otherwise noted, the income tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the marginal rate for the period. There were no non-GAAP adjustments in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Fiscal 2020 Impacts\n\n- In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized a $1.1 billion loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the cash tender offers on an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion in outstanding notes (Loss on extinguishment of debt).\n- Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company began a strategic review of its Canadian operations, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company announced additional actions to improve future performance and profitability of its Canadian operations. As a result of this review and related actions, the Company recognized pre-tax operating costs of $45 million related to inventory write-downs and other closing costs in fiscal 2020 (Canada restructuring).\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful indicator of, the Company's diluted earnings per common share as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's methods of determining this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies and may not be comparable.",

Additionally, there were 765 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 11% increase over the past 12 months ($406 million). Also contributing to the increase was the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). These were partially offset by a 9% decline in comparable store sales ($459 million), driven by a 5% decrease in customer transactions and a 4% decrease in average ticket, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China and lapping the prior-year value-added-tax benefit in China, unfavorable foreign currency translation ($436 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($127 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nInternational operating income for fiscal 2022 decreased 33% to $833.2 million, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021. Operating margin decreased 600 basis points to 12.0%, primarily due to sales deleverage related to COVID-19 pandemic impacts in our China market (approximately 460 basis points), investments and growth in retail store partner wages and benefits (approximately 140 basis points), lower temporary government subsidies (approximately 100 basis points), higher commodity and supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures (approximately 90 basis points) and strategic initiatives (approximately 90 basis points). These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage across markets outside of China.",

      "answer": "AMZN defines retail sales as a core component of its business, recognizing revenue from consumer product sales through online and physical stores upon delivery to customers, with a focus on fulfillment and customer control transfer. GM includes retail sales as one of three major components of vehicle sales, distinguishing them from fleet and courtesy transportation sales, and uses them as a key performance indicator for consumer demand in automotive markets. SBUX does not directly define or report retail sales, but its financial performance is negatively impacted by regulatory taxes on beverage sales, indicating a more indirect but significant sensitivity to consumer purchasing behavior and policy-driven cost pressures in retail environments. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are consumer-facing, they engage with retail sales differently\u2014AMZN as a direct revenue engine, GM as a market demand signal, and SBUX as a regulatory and cost risk exposure.",

        "Hop 2: GM \u2192 Retail Sales: GM categorizes retail sales as one of three vehicle sales types, distinguishing them from fleet and courtesy transportation sales, and uses total vehicle sales (including retail) as a performance metric, though it does not directly correlate to revenue recognition in a given period.",
        "Hop 3: SBUX \u2192 Retail Sales: While SBUX does not directly define retail sales, it discusses how taxes on beverage sales\u2014particularly in international markets\u2014negatively impact its business, indicating a regulatory and consumer behavior sensitivity tied to retail-level transactions."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\n\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\n\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\n\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\n\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\n\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and distribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\n\n## Return Allowances\n\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in 'Accrued expenses and other' and were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $5.2 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Included in 'Inventories' on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $948 million, $992 million, and $998 million as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in 'Fulfillment' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Vendor Agreements\n\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.",

Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures, which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China.

The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business.\n\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution, or sale of some of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of ingredients contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a progressive tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage, and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, in the Netherlands, a consumption tax is applicable on cold non-alcoholic beverages (non-milk based) at a flat tax rate of 26.13 Euro per 100 Liters. In addition to the tax es on the beverages (or components thereof), we also notice a regional increase in the adoption of environmentally focused taxes, including, for ex ample, plastic packaging tax  to encourage companies to increase usage of sustainable packaging options.\n\nThese tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have adversely impacted, and could continue to impact our business and financial performance by increasing the cost of certain of our products, reducing overall consumption of our products, or leading to negative publicity.\n\nFinally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has released guidance establishing a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis for multinational entities under Pillar Two of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative. As of September 29, 2024, certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation to adopt Pillar Two effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023, and other countries in which we operate are expected to introduce similar legislation to implement Pillar Two. This global minimum tax will not be effective for the Company until fiscal 2025, and it is not ex pected to result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to monitor regulatory developments with respect to this initiative for potential impacts.\n\nThe complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance, and restatements of our financial statements, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\n## We have been, and could continue to be, party to litigation or other legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business, results, operations, and reputation.\n\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business. These legal proceedings may involve claims brought by store partners, customers, government agencies, suppliers, shareholders, or others through private actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation, including litigation on a class or collective basis on behalf of what can be a large group of potential claimants. These legal proceedings have involved, and in the future may involve, allegations of illegal, unfair, or inconsistent employment practices, including those governing wage and hour, employment of minors, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, and vacation and family leave laws; food-safety issues including food-borne illness, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of our food products; data security or privacy breaches; customer discrimination; personal injury in our stores; marketing and advertising claims, including claims that our environmental and social program claims are misleading or inaccurate; infringement of patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights; violation of the federal securities laws; workers' compensation; or other concerns. We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and governmental audits alleging violations of federal and state employment laws, including wage and hour claims, and we could be involved in similar or even more significant litigation and legal proceedings in the future. Even if the allegations against us in current or future legal matters are unfounded or we ultimately are held not liable, the costs to defend ourselves may be significant, and the litigation may subject us to substantial settlements, fines, penalties, or judgments against us and may divert management's attention away from operating our business, all of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Litigation also may generate negative publicity, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are not liable, which could damage our reputation and adversely impact our sales as well as our relationships with our store partners and customers. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.",

Based on the Company's assessment of loss contingencies at each balance sheet date, a loss is recorded in the financial statements if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company historically determined that its primary brands constituted its operating segments. In 2019, reflecting changes to the management structure, the Company reorganized its operating segments from six to four operating segments by combining Booking.com with Rentalcars.com and KAYAK with OpenTable. The Company's Booking.com and Rentalcars.com operating segment represents a substantial majority of the Company's total revenues and operating income. The Company's operating segments continue to be aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similarity in economic characteristics, other qualitative factors and the objectives and principles of ASC 280, Segment Reporting.

This update also (1) requires an entity to recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax, (2) requires an entity to evaluate when a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which goodwill was originally recognized for accounting purposes and when it should be considered a separate transaction, and (3) requires that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe Company adopted this update on January 1, 2021 and applied the applicable amendments on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Accounting for Acquired Revenue Contracts with Customers in a Business Combination\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting update that requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , rather than at fair value on the acquisition date as required under current U.S. GAAP. The Company early adopted this update during the fourth quarter of 2021 and applied it retrospectively to all business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2021.\n\n## Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued a new accounting update relating to convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity. For convertible instruments, the accounting update reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current U.S. GAAP. The accounting update amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions.\n\nThe Company adopted this update on January 1, 2022 on a modified retrospective basis, which resulted in an increase of approximately $30 million to retained earnings. For the Company's convertible debt instruments, interest expense for the periods beginning after January 1, 2022 will be reflected in the financial statements using interest rates that typically are closer to the coupon interest rate of such instruments rather than a generally higher imputed interest expense that resulted from the separation of conversion features required by previous U.S. GAAP. See Note 12 for additional information on the Company's convertible debt instruments. The accounting update also requires changes in the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas, including the use of the if-converted method instead of the treasury stock method which was permitted in certain situations under current U.S. GAAP. See Note 8 for additional information on earnings per share.",

      "answer": "AMZN reports a declining trend in amortization expense, from $706 million in 2023 to projected lower amounts in future years, indicating mature intangible assets. HD states that its amortization expense was 'immaterial' for fiscal 2021 through 2023, suggesting limited reliance on amortizable intangible assets. SBUX provides a detailed multi-year forecast showing a sharp drop after 2025, with a total estimated future expense of $21.4 million, reflecting smaller and shorter-lived intangible assets compared to AMZN.

As a result, the consumer experience with mobile apps as well as brand recognition and loyalty continue to be increasingly important. Our mobile offerings have received generally strong reviews and are driving a material and increasing share of our business. We believe that mobile bookings are necessary to maintain and grow our business as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices instead of a personal computer. As a result, it is increasingly important for us to develop and maintain effective mobile platforms to provide consumers with an appealing, easy-to-use mobile experience and that the features of our mobile platforms are competitive with our peers. If we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly, and differentiated mobile offerings, and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if our mobile offerings are not used by consumers, we could lose market share and our business, future growth, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nGoogle's Android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world. As a result, Google has the ability to leverage its Android operating system to give its travel services a competitive advantage, either technically or with prominence on its Google Play app store or within its mobile search results. Further, Google is the leading internet search service and has leveraged its search popularity to promote its travel services. Although Google has faced legal challenges in Europe and the United States under various anticompetition laws, including in respect of giving its own services and products preferential treatment in the online search market, it is not yet clear how or whether these actions will further affect Google's business, including its travel services.\n\nApple has substantial market share in the smartphone market and controls integration of offerings, including travel services, into its mobile operating system. Apple also has more experience producing and developing mobile apps and has access to greater resources than we have. Apple may use or expand its existing and potential mobile apps such as Wallet, Siri (Apple's voice recognition \"concierge\" service), Apple Pay (Apple's mobile payment system), or another mobile app or functionality as a means of entering the online travel reservations marketplace. To the extent Google or Apple use their mobile operating systems, app distribution channels or, in the case of Google, search services, to favor their own travel service offerings, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nImpairments of goodwill, long-term investments, and long-lived assets, increases in provisions for expected credit losses on receivables from and cash advances made to our travel service provider and restaurant partners, and increases in cash outlays to refund consumers for prepaid reservations have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nAs a result of the deterioration of our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 we recorded goodwill impairment charges in our Kayak and OpenTable reporting unit and in our investment in DiDi Global, Inc. (\"DiDi\"). Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK, particularly the assumptions related to the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery, and the performance of the businesses during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in a need to recognize an additional goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Notes 5, 6 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the impairment charges.\n\nIn addition, in 2020, given the severe downturn in the global travel industry and the financial difficulties faced by many of our travel service provider and restaurant partners and marketing affiliates, we increased our provision for expected credit losses on receivables from and prepayments to our travel service provider and restaurant partners and marketing affiliates. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Due to the high level of cancellations of existing reservations, we incurred higher than normal cash outlays to refund consumers for prepaid reservations. In some instances, we did not estimate a recovery of prepayment already made to a travel service provider where we had agreed to provide free cancellations to consumers for non-refundable reservations. Any significant increase in our provision for expected credit losses and any significant increase in cash outlays to refund consumers would have a corresponding adverse effect on our results of operations and related cash flows. In certain instances, we may offer cancellable room rates on behalf of a partner to provide flexibility to our consumers even if the partner has not provided a cancellable room rate, which could have a negative impact on our revenues if we are unable to facilitate booking from another customer.\n\nWe are dependent on providers of accommodations, rental cars, and airline tickets and on restaurants.\n\nWe rely on providers of accommodations, rental cars, and airline tickets and on restaurants to make their services available to consumers through us. Our arrangements with travel service providers generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of accommodation reservations, rental cars, or airline tickets, or to make accommodation reservations, rental cars, or airline tickets available in any geographic area, for any particular route, or at any particular price. Similarly, our arrangements with restaurants generally do not require them to provide all of their available tables and",

      "question": "How do AMZN, HD, and SBUX each characterize their exposure to construction costs, and what does this reveal about their differing capital allocation strategies?",
      "answer": "AMZN addresses construction costs in the context of build-to-suit lease arrangements, where it records assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs when it has control over the building during the construction period. If control continues post-construction, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation. This suggests a strategic approach to managing construction exposure through structured lease arrangements and off-balance sheet treatment where possible. HD, on the other hand, capitalizes certain costs, including interest, related to construction in progress. This indicates a more direct capital investment approach, where construction costs are treated as long-term assets and amortized over their useful lives, aligning with HD\u2019s broader capital investment in physical infrastructure. SBUX mentions construction cost increases as a risk factor specifically tied to new store openings and remodels. The company frames construction costs as a potential drag on financial results, suggesting a cautious, cost-sensitive strategy when expanding or upgrading its retail footprint. Taken together, AMZN leverages leasing structures to manage construction exposure, HD capitalizes and amortizes costs as part of asset investment, and SBUX views construction costs through a risk management lens, highlighting sensitivity to cost pressures in expansion efforts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Construction Costs: AMZN records construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements only when it maintains control post-construction, otherwise derecognizing them, indicating strategic use of leasing to manage capital exposure.",
        "Hop 2: HD \u2192 Construction Costs: HD capitalizes interest and other costs related to construction in progress, treating them as long-term assets, which reflects a capital-intensive strategy focused on asset ownership and amortization.",
        "Hop 3: SBUX \u2192 Construction Costs: SBUX cites construction cost increases as a risk to financial performance, particularly in new store openings and remodels, showing a sensitivity to cost volatility and a more risk-averse capital allocation posture."

      "answer": "NKE approaches inventory reserves by estimating the net realizable value of inventories based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions, recording a reserve when the estimated net realizable value falls below inventory cost. SBUX records inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and estimated shrinkage, with reserves at $58.0 million as of September 29, 2024. TSLA, while not explicitly detailing its inventory reserve methodology, reports inventory and warranty reserves as a combined line item totaling $1,769 million as of December 31, 2024. These differences reflect NKE's focus on demand forecasting, SBUX's emphasis on inventory obsolescence and shrinkage, and TSLA's broader reserve strategy that includes product warranties, indicating varied risk management approaches across the consumer discretionary sector.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\nBecause of the uncertainty inherent in these m atters, actual results could differ from  the estim ates we use in the preparation of our C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents. W ithin the context of these critical accounting estim ates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circum stances that would result in m aterially different am ounts being reported.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nProvisions for anticipated sales returns consist of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\nEstim ates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claim s are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from  custom ers and outstanding discounts and claim s and (3) estim ated returns, discounts and claim s expected but not yet finalized with custom ers. Actual returns, discounts and claim s in any future period are inherently uncertain and m ay differ from  estim ates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claim s were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determ ination was m ade.\n\nRefer to N ote 14 - R evenues in the accom panying N otes to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents for additional inform ation.\n\n## INVENTORY RESERVES\n\nWe make ongoing estim ates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assum ptions about future dem and and m arket conditions. If we estim ate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estim ated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to C ost of sales. If changes in m arket conditions result in reductions to the estim ated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estim ate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we m ade such a determ ination.\n\n## HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES\n\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency m onetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been m et, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other com prehensive incom e (loss), rather than N et incom e, until the underlying hedged transaction affects N et incom e. In m ost cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from  Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) into N et incom e som etim e after the m aturity of the derivative. O ne of the criteria for this accounting treatm ent is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated am ount of anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estim ates of anticipated transactions m ay fluctuate over tim e and m ay ultim ately vary from  actual transactions. W hen the designated am ount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified tim e period or within an additional two-m onth period of tim e thereafter, we reclassify the cum ulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from  Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) to Other (incom e) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circum stances, the additional period of tim e m ay exceed two m onths due to extenuating circum stances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.\n\nRefer to N ote 12 - R isk M anagem ent and D erivatives in the accom panying N otes to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents for additional inform ation.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nWe are subject to taxation in the U nited States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. T he determ ination of our provision for incom e taxes requires significant judgm ent, the use of estim ates and the interpretation and application of com plex tax laws. O n an interim  basis, we estim ate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. T his estim ated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Incom e before incom e taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual item s, to determ ine the year-to-date Incom e tax expense. The incom e tax effects of infrequent or unusual item s are recognized in the interim  period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estim ate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estim ation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. W hen this occurs, we adjust the incom e tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estim ate occurs.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the am ount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circum stances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.

The changes in the fair values of these contracts are immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Normal Purchase Normal Sale\n\nWe enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fix ed green coffee purchase commitments, which we expect will result in physical delivery and utilization in the ordinary course of business in a reasonable period of time. Since these types of purchase commitments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption, they are not recorded as derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 5, Inventories, for further discussion of our derivative instruments and green coffee purchase commitments.\n\n## Receivables, net of Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nOur receivables are mainly generated from product and equipment sales to, and royalties from, our licensees, as well as from our Global Coffee Alliance and other Channel Development customers. The primary indicators of the credit quality of our receivables are aging, payment history, economic sector information, and outside credit monitoring. These indicators are assessed on a quarterly basis. Our credit loss exposure is mainly concentrated in our accounts receivable portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated using a loss-rate method based on historical ex perience, current market conditions, and reasonable forecasts. For the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024, we did not observe a significant deterioration of our receivable portfolio that required a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our allowance for credit losses was $21.2 million and $23.8 million, respectively.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience, and application of the specific identification method. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, inventory reserves were $58.0 million and $44.4 million, respectively.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use or to develop or obtain internal-use software, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment, 30 to 40 years for buildings, and 2 to 8 years for capitalized software. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, ex cluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to ex ercise a renewal option imposes a significant economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives. Capitalized software includes the costs of developing or obtaining internal-use software, such as external direct costs of materials and services, payroll and benefits costs, interest costs, and costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access or conversion of historical data by new systems. We capitalize costs when the preliminary project stage is complete, management has authorized and committed to funding the software project, it is probable that the software project will be completed, and it is probable that the software will be used to perform the intended function.\n\nThe portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell.\n\nWe evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying",

Nike experienced a $68 million unfavorable impact on income before income taxes due to foreign exchange translation effects, highlighting sensitivity to global currency fluctuations.

We expect approximately $1.0 billion of goodwill related to the acquisition to be deductible for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. At this time, all preliminary goodwill has been allocated to our three SRS reporting units and no goodwill currently resides in our Primary segment.\n\nWe have completed valuation analyses necessary to assess the fair v alues of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the amount of goodwill to be recognized as of the acquisition date. These fair v alues were based on management's estimates and assumptions; howev er, the amounts indicated above are preliminary in nature and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, there may be adjustments to the assigned v alues of acquired assets and liabilities assumed. Areas that remain preliminary primarily relate to income taxes, as well as any changes to residual goodwill resulting from measurement period adjustments. The final determination of acquisition date fair v alues and residual goodwill will be completed as soon as practicable, and within the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date as permitted under GAAP. Any adjustments to prov isional amounts that are identified during the measurement period will be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined. Measurement period adjustments recognized during fiscal 2024 were immaterial.\n\nResults of Operations. Net sales attributable to SRS since the completion of the acquisition and included within our results of operations for fiscal 2024 totaled $6.4 billion. Net earnings attributable to SRS since the completion of the acquisition and included within our results of operations for fiscal 2024 were immaterial.\n\nPro forma results of operations would not be materially different as a result of the acquisition and therefore are not presented.\n\n## Other Fiscal 2024 Acquisitions\n\nAll other acquisitions completed during fiscal 2024 were immaterial both indiv idually and in the aggregate.\n\n## Fiscal 2023 Acquisitions\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we completed three indiv idually immaterial acquisitions for total aggregate cash purchase consideration of $1.5 billion. We recognized aggregate definite-liv ed intangible assets of $469 million with a weighted av erage amortization period of 17 years, primarily related to customer relationships, and goodwill of $1.0 billion. The goodwill arising from the acquisitions resides in our Primary segment and is primarily attributable to operational synergies and acceleration of growth strategy, as well as the assembled workforce. The portion of goodwill generated through these acquisitions that is expected to be deductible for U.S. federal and state tax purposes is not material. Measurement period adjustments recognized during fiscal 2024 were immaterial and our purchase price allocations are now finalized.\n\nNet sales and net earnings for fiscal 2023 attributable to these acquisitions in the aggregate after their respectiv e acquisition dates were immaterial. Pro forma results of operations would not be materially different as a result of the acquisitions in the aggregate and therefore are not presented.\n\nItem 9.

F luctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U .S. D ollars for consolidated reporting. T he translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. D ollar denom inated balance sheets into U .S. D ollars for consolidated reporting results in a cum ulative translation adjustm ent to Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e, a weaker U .S. D ollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The im pact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detrim ent of approxim ately $141 m illion for the year ended M ay 31, 2024. T he im pact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Incom e before incom e taxes was a benefit of approxim ately $48 m illion for the year ended M ay 31, 2024.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTo m inim ize the im pact of translating foreign currency denom inated revenues and expenses into U .S. D ollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U .S. D ollar denom inated available-for-sale investm ents. T he variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U .S. D ollar denom inated investm ents at non-U .S. D ollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U .S. G AAP . W e utilize forward contracts and/or options to m itigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U .S. D ollar investm ents. T he com bination of the purchase and sale of the U .S. D ollar investm ent and the hedging instrum ent has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation im pact on net earnings in the period the investm ents are sold. H edges of the purchase of U .S.

D ollar, which could adversely im pact the U .S. D ollar value of these investm ents and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. W e have, in the past, hedged and m ay, in the future, hedge net investm ent positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to m itigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investm ents. T hese hedges are accounted for as net investm ent hedges in accordance with U .S. G AAP . T here were no outstanding net investm ent hedges as of M ay 31, 2024 and 2023. There were no cash flows from  net investm ent hedge settlem ents for the years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## CASH FLOW ACTIVITY\n\nCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $7,429 m illion for fiscal 2024, com pared to $5,841 m illion for fiscal 2023.

F or fiscal 2024, the favorable net change in working capital com pared to the prior year was prim arily im pacted by favorable changes to Inventories due to reduced inventory purchases and im proved lead tim es, partially offset by unfavorable changes to Accounts receivable due to the tim ing of wholesale shipm ents.\n\nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $894 m illion for fiscal 2024, com pared to an inflow of $564 m illion for fiscal 2023, prim arily driven by the net change in short-term  investm ents (including sales, m aturities and purchases).

Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

      "answer": "In 2021, AMZN reported interest on lease liabilities of $473 million, which was a smaller portion of its total lease cost of $19,085 million. HD reported interest on lease liabilities of $127 million, a small component of its total lease cost of $1,886 million. TSLA reported interest on lease liabilities of $89 million, which also represented a minor share of its total lease cost of $1,131 million. This suggests that all three companies rely more on amortization and operating lease costs than interest costs, but AMZN's lease financing is significantly larger in scale compared to HD and TSLA.",

Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users' ex perience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people's lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\n\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders' interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.8 billion and 10.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating ex penses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.\n\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\n\nFor additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.'\n\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 in Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States ('GAAP') requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.' Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value.

A lease vehicle asset group is determined to be impaired if an impairment indicator exists and the expected future cash flows, which include estimated residual values, are lower than the carrying amount of the vehicle asset group. If the carrying amount is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value of the vehicle asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows, including estimated residual values. In our automotive finance operations, when a leased vehicle is returned or repossessed, the asset is recorded in Other assets at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Upon disposition a gain or loss is recorded in  GM  Financial interest,  operating  and  other  ex penses  for  any  difference  between  the  net  book  value  of  the  leased  asset  and  the  proceeds  from  the disposition of the asset.\n\nEquity Investments When events and circumstances warrant, equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting are evaluated for impairment. An  impairment  charge  is  recorded  whenever  a  decline  in  value  of  an  equity  investment  below  its  carrying  amount  is  determined  to  be  other-than-temporary. Impairment charges related to equity method investments are recorded in Equity income. Equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value or in certain cases adjusted to fair value upon an observable price change, with changes in fair value recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\nProperty, net Property, plant and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. The gross amount of assets under finance leases is included in property, plant and equipment. Major improvements that extend the useful life or add functionality are capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We depreciate depreciable property using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease or the life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The amortization of the assets under finance leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in earnings. Impairment charges related to property are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales, Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nSpecial  T ools Special tools represent product-specific propulsion and non-propulsion related tools, dies, molds and other items used in the vehicle manufacturing process. Expenditures for special tools are recorded at cost and are capitalized. We amortize special tools over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method or an accelerated amortization method based on their historical and estimated production volume. Impairment charges related to special tools are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nGoodwill Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually on October 1 and when events warrant such a review. The impairment test entails an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is more likely than not that an impairment ex ists, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.\n\nIntangible Assets, net Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, primarily include brand names, technology and intellectual property, customer relationships and dealer networks. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line or an accelerated method of amortization over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of developed technology and intellectual property is recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales. Amortization of brand names, customer relationships and our dealer networks is recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Impairment charges, if any, related to intangible assets are recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nValuation of  Long-Lived Assets The carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business is evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value.  Product-specific  long-lived  asset  groups  and  non-product  specific  long-lived  assets  are  separately  tested  for impairment  on  an  asset  group  basis.  Fair  value  is  determined  using  either  the  market  or  sales  comparison  approach,  cost  approach  or  anticipated  cash  flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are considered held for use until disposition.\n\nGovernment Incentives and Grants We receive incentives from federal, state and local governments in different regions of the world that encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, employment or production in the region.

W ithin the context of these critical accounting estim ates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circum stances that would result in m aterially different am ounts being reported.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nProvisions for anticipated sales returns consist of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\nEstim ates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claim s are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from  custom ers and outstanding discounts and claim s and (3) estim ated returns, discounts and claim s expected but not yet finalized with custom ers. Actual returns, discounts and claim s in any future period are inherently uncertain and m ay differ from  estim ates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claim s were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determ ination was m ade.\n\nRefer to N ote 14 - R evenues in the accom panying N otes to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents for additional inform ation.\n\n## INVENTORY RESERVES\n\nWe make ongoing estim ates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assum ptions about future dem and and m arket conditions. If we estim ate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estim ated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to C ost of sales. If changes in m arket conditions result in reductions to the estim ated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estim ate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we m ade such a determ ination.\n\n## HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES\n\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency m onetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been m et, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other com prehensive incom e (loss), rather than N et incom e, until the underlying hedged transaction affects N et incom e. In m ost cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from  Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) into N et incom e som etim e after the m aturity of the derivative. O ne of the criteria for this accounting treatm ent is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated am ount of anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estim ates of anticipated transactions m ay fluctuate over tim e and m ay ultim ately vary from  actual transactions. W hen the designated am ount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified tim e period or within an additional two-m onth period of tim e thereafter, we reclassify the cum ulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from  Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) to Other (incom e) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circum stances, the additional period of tim e m ay exceed two m onths due to extenuating circum stances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.\n\nRefer to N ote 12 - R isk M anagem ent and D erivatives in the accom panying N otes to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents for additional inform ation.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nWe are subject to taxation in the U nited States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. T he determ ination of our provision for incom e taxes requires significant judgm ent, the use of estim ates and the interpretation and application of com plex tax laws. O n an interim  basis, we estim ate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. T his estim ated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Incom e before incom e taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual item s, to determ ine the year-to-date Incom e tax expense. The incom e tax effects of infrequent or unusual item s are recognized in the interim  period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estim ate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estim ation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. W hen this occurs, we adjust the incom e tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estim ate occurs.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the am ount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circum stances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.

      "question": "How do GM, NKE, and TSLA each characterize the impact of economic volatility on bad debt expense, and what does this reveal about their exposure to consumer and retail credit risk?",
      "answer": "GM reports that bad debt expense related to accounts and notes receivable was 'insignificant' in 2023, 2022, and 2021, indicating strong credit control and low exposure to customer defaults. In contrast, NKE highlights that deteriorating economic conditions and retailer financial difficulties could lead to 'increased bad debt expense' as a key risk factor, signaling higher vulnerability to credit losses in its wholesale channel. TSLA does not directly disclose bad debt expense figures but notes that decreases in retail or wholesale electricity prices could lead to 'an increased rate of customer defaults' in its energy business, suggesting indirect exposure to credit risk through pricing pressures rather than direct receivables management. Together, these perspectives reveal that while GM maintains tight credit controls and has minimal bad debt impact, NKE faces potential credit risk through its retail partners, and TSLA's credit exposure is more contingent on market pricing dynamics in its energy segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 Bad Debt Expense: GM explicitly states that bad debt expense for accounts and notes receivable was 'insignificant' across three years (2021\u20132023), showing strong credit management and low credit risk exposure.",
        "Hop 2: NKE \u2192 Bad Debt Expense: NKE warns that economic downturns and retailer insolvencies could lead to 'increased bad debt expense,' indicating that its credit risk is primarily channeled through its wholesale partners.",
        "Hop 3: TSLA \u2192 Bad Debt Expense: TSLA notes that falling electricity prices could result in 'increased rate of customer defaults' in its energy business, implying that its credit risk is indirectly tied to pricing and market conditions rather than direct receivables."

Realization  of  the  residual  values  is dependent  on  the  future  ability  to  market  the  vehicles  under  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  estimate  of  the  residual  value  is evaluated over the life of the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes. Adjustments may be in the form of revisions to the depreciation rate or recognition of an impairment charge. A lease vehicle asset group is determined to be impaired if an impairment indicator exists and the expected future cash flows, which include estimated residual values, are lower than the carrying amount of the vehicle asset group. If the carrying amount is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value of the vehicle asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows, including estimated residual values. In our automotive finance operations when a leased vehicle is returned or repossessed the asset is recorded in Other assets at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Upon disposition a gain or loss is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for any difference between the net book value of the leased asset and the proceeds from the disposition of the asset.\n\nEquity  Investments When  events  and  circumstances  warrant,  equity  investments  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of accounting are evaluated for impairment. An impairment charge is recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other-than-temporary. Impairment charges related to equity method investments are recorded in Equity income. Equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value or in  certain  cases  adjusted  to  fair  value  upon  an  observable  price  change,  with  changes  in  fair  value  recorded  in  Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\nProperty, net Property, plant and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. Major improvements that extend the useful life or add functionality are capitalized. The gross amount of assets under finance leases is included in property, plant and equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We depreciate depreciable property using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease or the life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The amortization of the assets under finance leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon retirement or disposition of property, plant  and  equipment,  the  cost  and  related  accumulated  depreciation  are  eliminated  and  any  resulting  gain  or  loss  is  recorded  in earnings. Impairment charges related to property are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales, Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nSpecial Tools Special tools represent product-specific propulsion and non-propulsion related tools, dies, molds and other items used in the vehicle manufacturing process. Expenditures for special tools are recorded at cost and are capitalized. We amortize special tools over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method or an accelerated amortization method based on their historical and estimated production volume. Impairment charges related to special tools are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nGoodwill Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually on October 1 and when events warrant such a review. The impairment test entails an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.\n\nIntangible Assets, net Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, primarily include brand names, technology and intellectual property, customer  relationships  and  dealer  networks.  Intangible  assets  are  amortized  on  a  straight-line  or  an  accelerated  method  of amortization over their estimated useful lives. An accelerated amortization method reflecting the pattern in which the asset will be consumed is utilized if that pattern can be reliably determined. We consider the period of expected cash flows and underlying data used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of  the  intangible  assets  when  selecting  a  useful  life. Amortization  of  developed  technology  and intellectual property is recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales. Amortization of brand names, customer relationships and our dealer networks is recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Impairment charges, if any, related to intangible assets are recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets The carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business is evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Product-specific long-lived asset groups and non-product specific long-lived assets are separately tested for impairment on an asset group basis. Fair value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach, cost approach or anticipated",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Government Subsidies\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ('CARES Act'), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID19 pandemic and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. Based on our evaluation of the CARES Act, we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. Additionally, the Canadian government enacted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ('CEWS') to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. We elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the U.S., Canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. The CARES Act and CEWS were no longer applicable to us in late fiscal 2021. The qualified payroll credits reduced our store operating expenses by $210.0 million and $349.6 million on our consolidated statement of earnings during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. After netting the qualified credits against our payable, a receivable balance of $69.4 million and $172.4 million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. As of October 2, 2022, deferred payroll tax payments of $116.5 million were included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 3, 2021, deferred payroll tax payments of $116.4 million were included in both accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $26.1 million and $30.9 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $104.7 million and $116.5 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs') or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return and metrics focused on building inclusive and diverse teams. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-ScholesMerton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nOur international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets.",

      "question": "How do GM, Lowe's, and Starbucks each describe the impact of changes in weighted average common shares outstanding on their earnings per share calculations, and what do these differences suggest about their capital structure strategies?",
      "answer": "General Motors explains that both basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated using weighted-average common shares outstanding, with an emphasis on the role this metric plays in determining earnings per share. Lowe's provides specific figures showing a decline in weighted-average common shares outstanding from 696 million in 2022 to 582 million in 2024, correlating with an increase in basic earnings per share from $12.07 to $13.23, suggesting share buybacks may have contributed to EPS growth. Starbucks reports a gradual reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding from 1,153.3 million in 2022 to 1,133.8 million in 2024, which aligns with a slight increase in basic EPS from $2.85 to $3.32, indicating a consistent capital return strategy through share repurchases. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three companies are managing their share counts to support earnings per share, Lowe's has executed a more aggressive reduction in shares, potentially signaling a stronger emphasis on shareholder value creation through EPS accretion.",

Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\n\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\n\n## Accounts Receivable, Net and Other\n\nIncluded in 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, customer receivables, net, were $14.8 billion and $20.2 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $4.8 billion and $5.3 billion, and seller receivables, net, were $381 million and $1.0 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory.\n\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $718 million, $1.1 billion, and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Additions to the allowance were $1.0 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.0 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $793 million, $1.0 billion, and $1.1 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Property and Equipment, Net\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years prior to January 1, 2020 and four years subsequent to January 1, 2020 for our servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in 'Property and equipment, net.' All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.\n\nCertain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone prices.\n\nLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from 'Other assets' upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on our marketable securities are included in other income (expense), net.\n\nThe cost of available-for-sale marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\nWe regularly review all of our marketable securities for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our marketable securities approximates its fair value.\n\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, government rebates already passed through to customers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $627 million and $46 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.",

Our initial public offering was priced at approximately $1.13 per share on June 28, 2010 as adjusted to give effect to the three-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2022 and the five-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020.\n\n## Holders\n\nAs of January 22, 2025, there were 9,512 holders of record of our common stock. A substantially greater number of holders of our common stock are 'street name' or beneficial holders, whose shares are held by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.\n\n## Dividend Policy\n\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\n\n## Stock Performance Graph\n\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed 'filed' for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'), or incorporated by reference into any filing of Tesla, Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act'), or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.\n\nThe following graph shows a comparison, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024, of the cumulative total return on our common stock, The NASDAQ Composite Index and a group of all public companies sharing the same SIC code as us, which is SIC code 3711, 'Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies' (Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies Public Company Group). Such returns are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance. Data for The NASDAQ Composite Index and the Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies Public Company Group assumes an investment of $100 on January 1, 2020 and reinvestment of dividends.

      "answer": "HD discusses return on invested capital (ROIC) as a forward-looking performance metric that could be impacted by macroeconomic conditions, strategic initiatives, and capital allocation decisions. LOW notes that its 2024 ROIC was positively impacted by approximately 44 basis points due to the sale of its Canadian retail business, highlighting divestitures as a strategic lever. NKE quantitatively reports a 34.9% ROIC for the trailing five quarters ended May 31, 2024, up from 31.5% the prior year, signaling strong capital efficiency and growth. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies track ROIC, they do so through different lenses: HD emphasizes external and strategic influences, LOW uses asset restructuring to enhance returns, and NKE demonstrates consistent performance improvement.",

In contrast, LOW does not disclose specific figures for total shares outstanding or changes in share count, but instead emphasizes total shareholder return performance relative to indices, suggesting a focus on return of capital through dividends and buybacks rather than equity issuance or employee compensation incentives.

Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users' ex perience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people's lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\n\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders' interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.8 billion and 10.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating ex penses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.\n\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\n\nFor additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.'\n\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 in Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States ('GAAP') requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.' Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product",

      "answer": "AMZN highlights that online sales continue to be a core growth driver, reinforcing its digital-first business model. LOW notes that online sales positively impacted comparable sales in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 by approximately 50 basis points each year, indicating a consistent but incremental digital contribution. MCD emphasizes digital transformation as part of its 'Accelerating the Arches' strategy, focusing on digital engagement, delivery, and drive-thru optimization, though it does not quantify the online sales impact directly. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies view digital channels as strategically important, the scale and maturity of online integration vary significantly\u2014with AMZN being the most digitally entrenched, LOW showing measurable but moderate digital growth, and MCD investing in digital transformation to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency.",

Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking or conditional words, such as 'could,' 'should,' 'can,' 'continue,' 'aim,' 'estimate,' 'forecast,' 'intend,' 'look,' 'may,' 'will,' 'ex pect,' 'believ e,' 'anticipate,' 'plan,' 'remain,' 'confident,' 'commit,' 'enable,' 'potential' and \"trajectory \" or similar ex pressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. They reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the dates the statements are made. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update such forward-looking statements. Y ou should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.\n\n## Risk F actors\n\nOur business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. A dditional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly adversely affect our business. If any of these risks were to materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies - including the components of our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy - must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's continued ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, including by maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu items, and doubling down on digital, delivery, drive thru and restaurant development;\n- innovate and differentiate the M cDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- build upon our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including building one of the world's largest consumer platforms to fuel engagement;\n- run great restaurants by building the easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform which enables franchisees to run restaurants more efficiently  and utiliz e the latest cloud-based technology  to make it easier for crews to deliv er ex ceptional customer service;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and building a modern company platform that unlocks speed and innovation throughout the organization; and\n- evolve and adjust our strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, and other events impacting our results of operations and liquidity.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in evolving or executing against our strategies, if the execution of our strategies proves to be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value or relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo continue to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value and relevance of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at M cDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which continuously evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, as well as by our perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. In addition, we cannot ensure that franchisees or business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.\n\nIf we do not anticipate and address industry trends and evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and industry trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to the use of digital channels and environmental and social responsibility matters. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors are\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 28",

      "answer": "AMZN recognizes government incentives as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses, particularly in areas like video and music content development and infrastructure investments, though it does not disclose specific dollar amounts.

TSLA records incentives as a reduction of expense or offset to capital assets, noting that IRA-related incentives primarily reduced material costs in 2023, signaling strategic alignment with clean energy and EV manufacturing policies.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\n\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\n\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\n\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\n\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\n\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and distribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\n\n## Return Allowances\n\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in 'Accrued expenses and other' and were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $5.2 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Included in 'Inventories' on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $948 million, $992 million, and $998 million as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in 'Fulfillment' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Vendor Agreements\n\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.",

C entral banks deploy various strategies to com bat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which im pact our borrowing costs. G overnm ent shutdowns or the risk of governm ent shutdowns, as well as the im pact or expected im pact of elections, both in the U nited States and in other countries around the world, m ay also increase volatility. Additionally, there has been, and m ay continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates that im pact the U .S. D ollar value relative to other international currencies. O ur international revenues and expenses generally are derived from  sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations, specifically am ounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U .S. D ollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U .S. D ollar adversely affects the U .S. D ollar value of the C om pany's foreign currency-denom inated sales and earnings. C urrency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent m anufacturers that produce our products by m aking their purchases of raw m aterials m ore expensive and m ore difficult to finance. F oreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to com pletely elim inate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative im pact of a stronger U .S. D ollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive im pact of a weaker U .S. D ollar or other trading currency. O ur future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected by the value of the U .S. D ollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given tim e period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale customers.\n\nWe extend credit to our custom ers based on an assessm ent of a custom er's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. T o assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain custom ers the opportunity to place orders five to six m onths ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program . T hese advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with econom ic uncertainty. In the past, som e custom ers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. W hen the retail econom y weakens or as consum er behavior shifts, retailers tend to be m ore cautious with orders. A slowing or changing econom y in our key m arkets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our custom ers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. I n addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality m erchandising and an appealing retail environm ent to attract consum ers, which requires continuing investm ents by retailers. R etailers that experience financial difficulties m ay fail to m ake such investm ents or delay them , resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.\n\n## Climate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nThere are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atm osphere have caused, and m ay continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate, increases in global tem peratures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extrem e weather and clim ate events. C lim ate change m ay also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw m aterials, including those used in the production of our products, and m ay result in changes in regulations or consum er preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. F or exam ple, there has been increased focus by governm ental and nongovernm ental organizations, consum ers, custom ers, em ployees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably m ade and other sustainability m atters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and m aterials transparency, any of which m ay require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local governm ental authorities in various countries are im plem enting, have proposed and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or m itigate the im pacts of clim ate change on the environm ent. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of clim ate change, which could increase the com plexity of, and potential cost related to com plying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing m ay require us to m ake additional investm ents in facilities and equipm ent, m ay im pact the availability and cost of key raw m aterials used in the production of our products or the dem and for our products, and, in turn, m ay adversely im pact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nI nvestors, regulators and other stakeholders are also increasingly scrutinizing com panies' environm ental, social and governance ('E SG ') com m itm ents, perform ance and disclosures, including related to clim ate change, and in recent years have placed increasing im portance on social costs and related im plications of their investm ents.

The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business.\n\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution, or sale of some of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of ingredients contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a progressive tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage, and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, in the Netherlands, a consumption tax is applicable on cold non-alcoholic beverages (non-milk based) at a flat tax rate of 26.13 Euro per 100 Liters. In addition to the tax es on the beverages (or components thereof), we also notice a regional increase in the adoption of environmentally focused taxes, including, for ex ample, plastic packaging tax  to encourage companies to increase usage of sustainable packaging options.\n\nThese tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have adversely impacted, and could continue to impact our business and financial performance by increasing the cost of certain of our products, reducing overall consumption of our products, or leading to negative publicity.\n\nFinally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has released guidance establishing a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis for multinational entities under Pillar Two of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative. As of September 29, 2024, certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation to adopt Pillar Two effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023, and other countries in which we operate are expected to introduce similar legislation to implement Pillar Two. This global minimum tax will not be effective for the Company until fiscal 2025, and it is not ex pected to result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to monitor regulatory developments with respect to this initiative for potential impacts.\n\nThe complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance, and restatements of our financial statements, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\n## We have been, and could continue to be, party to litigation or other legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business, results, operations, and reputation.\n\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to litigation and other legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business. These legal proceedings may involve claims brought by store partners, customers, government agencies, suppliers, shareholders, or others through private actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation, including litigation on a class or collective basis on behalf of what can be a large group of potential claimants. These legal proceedings have involved, and in the future may involve, allegations of illegal, unfair, or inconsistent employment practices, including those governing wage and hour, employment of minors, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, and vacation and family leave laws; food-safety issues including food-borne illness, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of our food products; data security or privacy breaches; customer discrimination; personal injury in our stores; marketing and advertising claims, including claims that our environmental and social program claims are misleading or inaccurate; infringement of patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights; violation of the federal securities laws; workers' compensation; or other concerns. We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and governmental audits alleging violations of federal and state employment laws, including wage and hour claims, and we could be involved in similar or even more significant litigation and legal proceedings in the future. Even if the allegations against us in current or future legal matters are unfounded or we ultimately are held not liable, the costs to defend ourselves may be significant, and the litigation may subject us to substantial settlements, fines, penalties, or judgments against us and may divert management's attention away from operating our business, all of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Litigation also may generate negative publicity, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are not liable, which could damage our reputation and adversely impact our sales as well as our relationships with our store partners and customers. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.",

      "question": "How do Home Depot, McDonald's, and Nike differ in their strategic emphasis and performance trends related to online sales, and what does this reveal about sector-specific digital channel dynamics in the consumer discretionary space?",
      "answer": "Home Depot reported a 6.6% increase in online sales, which contributed to 15.1% of total net sales in fiscal 2024, indicating a growing digital footprint despite an overall negative comparable sales environment. McDonald's, while not providing a specific metric, emphasized digital channels as a core component of its 'Accelerating the Arches' strategy, highlighting the importance of digital ordering, delivery, and customer engagement platforms to drive systemwide sales growth. In contrast, Nike experienced an 8% decline in digital sales during fiscal 2024, despite overall growth in NIKE Direct revenues, suggesting a potential challenge in maintaining digital momentum in the athletic wear segment. These differences highlight how online sales are leveraged differently across sub-sectors: Home Depot is capitalizing on e-commerce for product delivery and pickup, McDonald's is embedding digital into its core customer experience and operations, while Nike is navigating a digital sales headwind despite strong in-store and wholesale performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\nNet Sales. Fiscal 2024 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2023. Net sales for fiscal 2024 increased $6.8 billion, or 4.5%, to $159.5 billion. T he increase in net sales for fiscal 2024 was primarily driv en by SRS, which contributed $6.4 billion of net sales during fiscal 2024, and incremental net sales of approximately $2.5 billion attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2024. This increase in net sales was partially offset by the impact of a negativ e comparable sales env ironment, primarily driv en by decreases in comparable customer transactions and comparable av erage ticket.\n\nOnline sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or deliv ered to customer locations, represented 15.1% of net sales and increased by 6.6% during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, including the online sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2024.\n\nA stronger U.S. dollar negativ ely impacted net sales by $298 million in fiscal 2024.\n\nComparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period ov er the comparable prior period of equiv alent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52 week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they hav e been owned for more than 52 weeks. Our comparable sales results for fiscal 2024 exclude the 53rd week and compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2024 to the 52-week period reported for fiscal 2023. The method of calculating comparable sales v aries across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. nd\n\nTotal comparable sales decreased 1.8% in fiscal 2024, reflecting a 1.0% decrease in comparable customer transactions and a 0.9% decrease in comparable average ticket compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in comparable customer transactions primarily reflects the impact of heightened macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including the impacts of a persisting high interest rate env ironment pressuring home improvement demand. The decrease in comparable av erage ticket primarily reflects price stabilization relativ e to last year, slightly offset by demand for new and innovativ e products.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, our Power and Building Materials merchandising departments posted positiv e comparable sales compared to fiscal 2023. All of our other merchandising departments posted negativ e comparable sales during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\n\n## Gross Profit\n\nGross profit increased $2.3 billion, or 4.6%, to $53.3 billion in fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.4% for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, and primarily reflected lower transportation costs and lower shrink within our Primary segment, offset by the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOur operating expenses are composed of SG&amp;A and depreciation and amortization.\n\nSelling, General &amp; Administrative. SG&amp;A increased $2.2 billion, or 8.1%, to $28.7 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, SG&amp;A was 18.0% in fiscal 2024 compared to 17.4% in fiscal 2023, which primarily reflects higher payroll costs, delev erage from a negativ e comparable sales env ironment and lower legal-related benefits.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $361 million, or 13.5%, to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.9% in fiscal 2024 compared to 1.8% in fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense of $239 million, of which $218 million was related to SRS, as well as increased depreciation expense from ongoing inv estments in the business.\n\n## Interest and Other, net\n\nInterest and other, net increased $355 million, or 20.1%, to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, interest and other, net, was 1.3% in fiscal 2024 compared to 1.2% in fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher interest expense driv en by higher long-term debt.\n\n## Provision for Income Taxes\n\nOur combined effectiv e income tax rate was 23.7% in fiscal 2024 compared to 24.0% in fiscal 2023.",

Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking or conditional words, such as 'could,' 'should,' 'can,' 'continue,' 'aim,' 'estimate,' 'forecast,' 'intend,' 'look,' 'may,' 'will,' 'ex pect,' 'believ e,' 'anticipate,' 'plan,' 'remain,' 'confident,' 'commit,' 'enable,' 'potential' and \"trajectory \" or similar ex pressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. They reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the dates the statements are made. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update such forward-looking statements. Y ou should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.\n\n## Risk F actors\n\nOur business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. A dditional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly adversely affect our business. If any of these risks were to materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies - including the components of our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy - must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's continued ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, including by maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu items, and doubling down on digital, delivery, drive thru and restaurant development;\n- innovate and differentiate the M cDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- build upon our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including building one of the world's largest consumer platforms to fuel engagement;\n- run great restaurants by building the easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform which enables franchisees to run restaurants more efficiently  and utiliz e the latest cloud-based technology  to make it easier for crews to deliv er ex ceptional customer service;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and building a modern company platform that unlocks speed and innovation throughout the organization; and\n- evolve and adjust our strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, and other events impacting our results of operations and liquidity.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in evolving or executing against our strategies, if the execution of our strategies proves to be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value or relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo continue to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value and relevance of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at M cDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which continuously evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, as well as by our perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. In addition, we cannot ensure that franchisees or business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.\n\nIf we do not anticipate and address industry trends and evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and industry trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to the use of digital channels and environmental and social responsibility matters. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors are\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 28",

GM's tax expense was primarily driven by U.S. federal taxes and state/local taxes, with a notable impact from general business credits and manufacturing incentives reducing the overall liability. LOW's tax provision was dominated by current federal and state taxes, with minimal deferred tax impact.

LOW, in contrast, shows a declining trend with $100 million in finance lease obligations for the same period. TSLA reports only $102 million in finance leases for 2025, a sharp drop from previous years, indicating a significant reduction in financed assets. This comparison suggests that HD maintains a more stable finance lease position, LOW is actively reducing its finance lease exposure, and TSLA is rapidly transitioning away from finance leases, potentially signaling a shift in asset financing strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.\n\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\n\n## Financing Obligations\n\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.\n\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\n\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See 'Note 5 - Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.'\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $6.8 billion and $10.7 billion.",

      "answer": "Inventory management at LOW impacted net earnings through increased obsolete inventory reserves and sensitivity to shrinkage estimates, with a 10% change in either factor affecting net earnings by $18 million and $32 million respectively. HD's net earnings were indirectly affected due to changes in working capital driven by inventory normalization and timing of vendor payments, despite an overall increase in operating cash flows. SBUX experienced a direct impact on net earnings through foreign currency hedges, where a 10% increase in the underlying rate decreased net earnings by $24 million, while a 10% decrease increased net earnings by $24 million. Together, these factors reveal that companies in the Consumer Discretionary sector face distinct financial pressures\u2014LOW through inventory valuation risks, HD through operational cash flow dynamics, and SBUX through currency exposure\u2014highlighting different dimensions of risk management in a consumer-sensitive industry.",

      "question": "How do AMZN, BKNG, and MCD differ in their shareholder base size and dividend-related activities as of early 2024, and what might this indicate about their capital return strategies?",
      "answer": "As of early 2024, AMZN reported 11,656 shareholders of record and made no equity purchases or dividend announcements, indicating a lack of immediate capital return initiatives. In contrast, BKNG introduced a formal dividend policy, declaring a $8.75 per share quarterly dividend payable in March 2024, while maintaining a much smaller base of approximately 117 shareholders of record. MCD, with an estimated 4.5 million shareholders (including beneficial owners), has maintained a long-standing dividend policy, having increased dividends for 48 consecutive years, and also engaged in share repurchases during Q4 2023. This suggests that MCD and BKNG are actively returning capital to shareholders, with MCD taking a more balanced approach with both dividends and buybacks, while BKNG is newly adopting a dividend-focused strategy. AMZN, on the other hand, appears to be holding capital for reinvestment or future strategic moves.",

      "answer": "Home Depot reported that net earnings attributable to the SRS acquisition were immaterial in fiscal 2024, indicating minimal immediate financial impact from the acquisition despite the $6.4 billion in net sales contribution. Lowe\u2019s disclosed that a 10% change in its self-insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $72 million, highlighting a material sensitivity to this liability. Nike stated that foreign exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of approximately $68 million on income before income taxes for the year ended May 31, 2024, showing a significant exposure to currency translation risks. Collectively, these insights reveal that while HD's acquisition had limited earnings impact in the short term, LOW and NKE face meaningful exposure to non-operational financial drivers\u2014specifically insurance liabilities and foreign exchange volatility\u2014which could materially influence their net earnings.",

We expect approximately $1.0 billion of goodwill related to the acquisition to be deductible for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. At this time, all preliminary goodwill has been allocated to our three SRS reporting units and no goodwill currently resides in our Primary segment.\n\nWe have completed valuation analyses necessary to assess the fair v alues of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the amount of goodwill to be recognized as of the acquisition date. These fair v alues were based on management's estimates and assumptions; howev er, the amounts indicated above are preliminary in nature and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, there may be adjustments to the assigned v alues of acquired assets and liabilities assumed. Areas that remain preliminary primarily relate to income taxes, as well as any changes to residual goodwill resulting from measurement period adjustments. The final determination of acquisition date fair v alues and residual goodwill will be completed as soon as practicable, and within the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date as permitted under GAAP. Any adjustments to prov isional amounts that are identified during the measurement period will be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined. Measurement period adjustments recognized during fiscal 2024 were immaterial.\n\nResults of Operations. Net sales attributable to SRS since the completion of the acquisition and included within our results of operations for fiscal 2024 totaled $6.4 billion. Net earnings attributable to SRS since the completion of the acquisition and included within our results of operations for fiscal 2024 were immaterial.\n\nPro forma results of operations would not be materially different as a result of the acquisition and therefore are not presented.\n\n## Other Fiscal 2024 Acquisitions\n\nAll other acquisitions completed during fiscal 2024 were immaterial both indiv idually and in the aggregate.\n\n## Fiscal 2023 Acquisitions\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we completed three indiv idually immaterial acquisitions for total aggregate cash purchase consideration of $1.5 billion. We recognized aggregate definite-liv ed intangible assets of $469 million with a weighted av erage amortization period of 17 years, primarily related to customer relationships, and goodwill of $1.0 billion. The goodwill arising from the acquisitions resides in our Primary segment and is primarily attributable to operational synergies and acceleration of growth strategy, as well as the assembled workforce. The portion of goodwill generated through these acquisitions that is expected to be deductible for U.S. federal and state tax purposes is not material. Measurement period adjustments recognized during fiscal 2024 were immaterial and our purchase price allocations are now finalized.\n\nNet sales and net earnings for fiscal 2023 attributable to these acquisitions in the aggregate after their respectiv e acquisition dates were immaterial. Pro forma results of operations would not be materially different as a result of the acquisitions in the aggregate and therefore are not presented.\n\nItem 9.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nassociated with these activities do not require subjective long-term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year.  Adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.\n\n## Self-Insurance\n\n## Description\n\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, property, general and product liability, extended protection plans, and certain medical and dental claims. We have excess insurance coverage above certain retention amounts to limit exposure from single events and earnings volatility. Our selfinsured retention or deductible, as applicable, is limited to $2 million per occurrence involving workers' compensation, and $10 million per occurrence involving general liability, product liability, and automobile liability. We do not have any ex cess insurance coverage for self-insured ex tended protection plan or medical and dental claims. Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. During fiscal 2024, our self-insurance liabilities decreased approximately $138 million to $966 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nThese estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment, utilized discount rate, projected exposures including payroll, sales and vehicle units, as well as the frequency, lag and severity of claims.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. Although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. A 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $72 million for fiscal 2024. A 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $18 million for fiscal 2024.\n\n## Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nIn addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are ex posed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nWe use interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt. The fair value of our derivative financial instruments as of January 31, 2025, was not material. Fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because nearly all of our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fix ed-rate instruments.  Therefore, providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control, which could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations.  We believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices.  The selling prices of these commodity products are influenced, in part, by the market price we pay and our competitive environment.",

F luctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U .S. D ollars for consolidated reporting. T he translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. D ollar denom inated balance sheets into U .S. D ollars for consolidated reporting results in a cum ulative translation adjustm ent to Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e, a weaker U .S. D ollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The im pact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detrim ent of approxim ately $141 m illion for the year ended M ay 31, 2024. T he im pact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Incom e before incom e taxes was a benefit of approxim ately $48 m illion for the year ended M ay 31, 2024.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTo m inim ize the im pact of translating foreign currency denom inated revenues and expenses into U .S. D ollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U .S. D ollar denom inated available-for-sale investm ents. T he variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U .S. D ollar denom inated investm ents at non-U .S. D ollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U .S. G AAP . W e utilize forward contracts and/or options to m itigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U .S. D ollar investm ents. T he com bination of the purchase and sale of the U .S. D ollar investm ent and the hedging instrum ent has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation im pact on net earnings in the period the investm ents are sold. H edges of the purchase of U .S. D ollar denom inated available-for-sale investm ents are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nWe estim ate the com bination of translation of foreign currency-denom inated profits from  our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in O ther (incom e) expense, net had an unfavorable im pact of approxim ately $68 m illion on our Incom e before incom e taxes for the year ended M ay 31, 2024.\n\n## NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\n\nWe are also exposed to the im pact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investm ents in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denom inated in a currency other than the U .S. D ollar, which could adversely im pact the U .S. D ollar value of these investm ents and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. W e have, in the past, hedged and m ay, in the future, hedge net investm ent positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to m itigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investm ents. T hese hedges are accounted for as net investm ent hedges in accordance with U .S. G AAP . T here were no outstanding net investm ent hedges as of M ay 31, 2024 and 2023. There were no cash flows from  net investm ent hedge settlem ents for the years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## CASH FLOW ACTIVITY\n\nCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $7,429 m illion for fiscal 2024, com pared to $5,841 m illion for fiscal 2023.

      "question": "How do Amazon, Nike, and Starbucks each reflect the impact of product costs on their financial performance, and what do their disclosures suggest about their respective strategies for managing these costs?",
      "answer": "Amazon highlights rising product and shipping costs due to increased sales, but notes that fulfillment network efficiencies and lower transportation rates partially offset these increases. Nike, on the other hand, reports a decrease in product costs due to lower ocean freight and logistics expenses, which helped counteract gross margin pressures. Starbucks discloses product and distribution costs as a percentage of North America total net revenues, showing a slight decrease from 28.3% in 2023 to 27.7% in 2024, indicating some cost control. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three companies are sensitive to product cost fluctuations, they employ different strategies\u2014Amazon focuses on fulfillment efficiency, Nike benefits from reduced freight costs, and Starbucks manages costs through distribution optimization.",

In particular, political and econom ic instability, geopolitical conflicts, political unrest, civil strife, terrorist activity, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation, nationalism  and other econom ic or political uncertainties in the U nited States or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations. Any negative sentim ent toward the U nited States as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business.\n\nI n addition, terrorist acts, m ilitary conflict and disease outbreaks have increased the risks of doing business abroad. T hese factors, am ong others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure m aterials, or our costs for m anufacturing and procuring m aterials, our ability to im port products, our ability to sell products in international m arkets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors m ake the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or im practical, our business could be adversely affected.\n\n## Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\n\nThe principal m aterials used in our footwear products - natural and synthetic rubber, plastic com pounds, foam  cushioning m aterials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane film s - are locally available to m anufacturers. T he principal m aterials used in our apparel products - natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized perform ance fabrics designed to efficiently wick m oisture away from  the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and m etal hardware - are also available in countries where our m anufacturing takes place. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our contract m anufacturers to locate, train, em ploy and retain adequate personnel. N IKE  contract m anufacturers and m aterials suppliers buy raw m aterials and are subject to wage rates and other labor standards that are oftentim es regulated by the governm ents of the countries in which our products are m anufactured.\n\nThere could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw m aterials from  current sources or, in the event of a disruption or heightened com petition for such m aterials, our contract m anufacturers m ight not be able to locate alternative suppliers of m aterials of com parable quality at an acceptable price or at all. F urther, our contract m anufacturers have experienced and m ay continue to experience in the future, unexpected closures, unexpected increases in work wages or other changes in labor standards, whether governm ent mandated or otherwise, and increases in com pliance costs due to governm ental regulation concerning certain m etals, fabrics or raw m aterials used in the m anufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that m anufacturers that we do not contract and that we refer to as \"unaffiliated m anufacturers\" will be able to fill our orders in a tim ely manner. If we experience significant increases in dem and, or reductions in the availability of m aterials, or need to replace an existing contract m anufacturer or m aterials supplier, there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw m aterials or additional m anufacturing capacity will be available when required on term s acceptable to us, or at all, or that any contract m anufacturer, unaffiliated m anufacturer, or any m aterials supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to m eet our requirem ents. E ven if we are able to expand existing or find new m anufacturing capacity or sources of m aterials, we m ay encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the tim e it takes to train suppliers and m anufacturers in our m ethods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. In addition, changes we m ake in m anaging the supply of our products, such as changes to decrease the supply of certain products, pose the risk that we m ay not be able to m eet dem and for, or ram p up production of, certain products tim ely or without additional cost. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, in the supply of m aterials or in the m anufacturing of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to m eet retail custom er and consum er dem and for our products and result in lower revenues and net incom e both in the short- and long-term .\n\nBecause contract m anufacturers m ake a m ajority of our products outside of our principal sales m arkets, our products m ust be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. D elays in the shipm ent or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, container shortages, labor shortages, including work stoppages or port strikes, infrastructure and port congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between m anufacturers, have adversely im pacted, and could in the future adversely im pact the availability of our products and, in turn, our financial perform ance.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as 'believes,' 'expects,' 'anticipates,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'seeks,' or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as 'will,' 'should,' 'could,' 'may,' 'aims,' 'intends,' or 'projects,' and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors (many beyond our control) that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience or from our current expectations or projections. Our forward-looking statements, and the risks and uncertainties related thereto, include, but are not limited to, those described under the 'Risk Factors' and 'Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' sections and in other reports we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'), as well as, among others:\n\n- our ability to preserve, grow, and leverage our brands, including the risk of negative responses by consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns), governmental actors (such as retaliatory legislative treatment), or other third parties who object to certain actions taken or not taken by the Company, whose responses could adversely affect our brand value;\n- the impact of our marketing strategies, promotional and advertising plans, pricing strategies, platforms, reformulations, innovations, or customer experience initiatives or investments;\n- the costs and risks associated with, and the successful execution and effects of, our existing and any future business opportunities, expansions, initiatives, strategies, investments, and plans, including our Back to Starbucks plan;\n- changes in consumer preferences, demand, consumption, or spending behavior, including due to shifts in demographic or health and wellness trends, reduction in discretionary spending and price increases, and our ability to anticipate or react to these changes;\n- the ability of our business partners, suppliers, and third-party providers to fulfill their responsibilities and commitments;\n- the potential negative effects of reported incidents involving food- or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, or mislabeling; \u00b7 our ability to open new stores and efficiently maintain the attractiveness of our existing stores;\n- our dependence on the financial performance of our North America operating segment and our increasing dependence on certain international markets;\n- our anticipated operating expenses, including our anticipated total capital expenditures;\n- inherent risks of operating a global business, including changing conditions in our markets, local factors affecting store openings, protectionist trade or foreign investment policies, economic or trade sanctions, compliance with local laws and other regulations, and local labor policies and conditions, including labor strikes and work stoppages;\n- higher costs, lower quality, or unavailability of coffee, dairy, cocoa, energy, water, raw materials, or product ingredients;\n- the potential impact on our supply chain of adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, or significant increases in logistics costs;\n- the ability of our supply chain to meet current or future business needs and our ability to scale and improve our forecasting, planning, production, and logistics management;\n- a worsening in the terms and conditions upon which we engage with our manufacturers and source suppliers, whether resulting from broader local or global conditions or dynamics specific to our relationships with such parties;\n- the impact of unfavorable global or regional economic conditions and related economic slowdowns or recessions, low consumer confidence, high\n- unemployment, weak credit or capital markets, budget deficits, burdensome government debt, austerity measures, higher interest rates, higher taxes, international trade disputes, government restrictions, geopolitical instability, higher inflation, or deflation;\n- failure to meet our announced guidance or market expectations and the impact thereof;\n- failure to attract or retain key executive or partner talent or successfully transition executives;\n- the impacts of partner investments and changes in the availability and cost of labor, including any union organizing efforts and our responses to such efforts;\n- the impact of foreign currency translation, particularly a stronger U.S. dollar;\n- the impact of, and our ability to respond to, substantial competition from new entrants, consolidations by competitors, and other competitive activities, such as pricing actions (including price reductions, promotions, discounting, couponing, or free goods), marketing, category expansion, product introductions, or entry or expansion in our geographic markets;\n- potential impacts of climate change;\n- evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations;\n- the potential impact of activist shareholder actions or tactics;",

Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $625 million and $359 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Automotive Leasing\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\n\n## Services and Other\n\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs of retail merchandise sales.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $756 million and $115 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to affect tax able income. V aluation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax  assets to the amount expected to be realized.",

      "question": "How did foreign exchange fluctuations impact the international segment performance of Amazon, McDonald's, and Starbucks in 2023, and what does this reveal about their respective sensitivities to currency risk?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Amazon's International segment net sales increased by $88 million due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, but the company faces significant exposure, with potential losses of up to $1.3 billion on intercompany balances under a 20% adverse rate movement. McDonald's, while not directly quantifying currency impacts, faces operational risks through its extensive international franchise and supplier network, where disputes and regulatory challenges may be exacerbated by currency volatility. Starbucks experienced an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $235 million on revenue, directly reducing growth in its International segment. This comparative analysis reveals that while Amazon and Starbucks face direct financial exposure through translation and intercompany balances, McDonald's exposure is more indirect but still material through its global operational footprint.",

      "answer": "HD reported interest on lease liabilities at $127 million in 2022, contributing to a total lease cost of $1,886 million. LOW disclosed interest on lease liabilities at $30 million, as part of a total lease cost of $1,086 million. TSLA reported interest on lease liabilities at $89 million, within a total lease cost of $1,131 million. Comparatively, HD has the highest proportion of interest relative to total lease cost (~6.7%), indicating a more finance lease-heavy structure and potentially higher financial leverage. LOW has the lowest interest burden (~2.8%), suggesting a lighter reliance on finance leases and a preference for operating leases. TSLA\u2019s interest cost (~7.9% of total lease cost) reflects a stronger reliance on financed assets, aligning with its capital-intensive manufacturing model. This comparison reveals differing capital allocation strategies: HD and TSLA lean more on finance leases (with associated interest costs), while LOW favors operating leases.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BKNG reported a total income tax expense of $300 million, with no clear split between current and deferred taxes, but the components suggest a mix driven by foreign rate differentials and valuation allowances. GM's total income tax expense was $2,771 million, of which $557 million was current and $2,214 million was deferred, indicating a significant deferred tax liability, particularly from U.S. federal operations. NKE had a total income tax expense of $605 million, with $1,255 million current and a deferred tax benefit of $650 million, showing a strong foreign current tax component and U.S. federal deferred tax relief. These differences suggest that GM is managing a large deferred tax burden, NKE benefits from deferred tax credits, and BKNG's tax profile is shaped by international tax benefits and impairments.",

SBUX specifically highlighted the potential impact of significant increases in logistics costs on its supply chain and its ability to meet business needs. TSLA included shipping and logistics costs as a direct component of its automotive sales cost of revenue, indicating a clear and measurable exposure to these expenses. Together, this reveals that while all three companies are exposed to logistics cost volatility, GM sees it as part of a larger inflationary risk, SBUX emphasizes strategic supply chain scalability concerns, and TSLA directly incorporates logistics into core cost of sales, suggesting a more integrated financial sensitivity.",

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as 'believes,' 'expects,' 'anticipates,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'seeks,' or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as 'will,' 'should,' 'could,' 'may,' 'aims,' 'intends,' or 'projects,' and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors (many beyond our control) that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience or from our current expectations or projections. Our forward-looking statements, and the risks and uncertainties related thereto, include, but are not limited to, those described under the 'Risk Factors' and 'Management ' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' sections and in other reports we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'), as well as, among others:\n\n- our ability to preserve, grow, and leverage our brands, including the risk of negative responses by consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns), governmental actors (such as retaliatory legislative treatment), or other third parties who object to certain actions taken or not taken by the Company, whose responses could adversely affect our brand value;\n- the impact of our marketing strategies, promotional and advertising plans, pricing strategies, platforms, reformulations, innovations, or customer experience initiatives or investments;\n- the costs and risks associated with, and the successful execution and effects of, our existing and any future business opportunities, expansions, initiatives, strategies, investments, and plans, including our Back to Starbucks plan;\n- changes in consumer preferences, demand, consumption, or spending behavior, including due to shifts in demographic or health and wellness trends, reduction in discretionary spending and price increases, and our ability to anticipate or react to these changes;\n- the ability of our business partners, suppliers, and third-party providers to fulfill their responsibilities and commitments;\n- the potential negative effects of reported incidents involving food- or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, or mislabeling; \u00b7 our ability to open new stores and efficiently maintain the attractiveness of our existing stores;\n- our dependence on the financial performance of our North America operating segment and our increasing dependence on certain international markets;\n- our anticipated operating expenses, including our anticipated total capital expenditures;\n- inherent risks of operating a global business, including changing conditions in our markets, local factors affecting store openings, protectionist trade or foreign investment policies, economic or trade sanctions, compliance with local laws and other regulations, and local labor policies and conditions, including labor strikes and work stoppages;\n- higher costs, lower quality, or unavailability of coffee, dairy, cocoa, energy, water, raw materials, or product ingredients;\n- the potential impact on our supply chain of adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, or significant increases in logistics costs;\n- the ability of our supply chain to meet current or future business needs and our ability to scale and improve our forecasting, planning, production, and logistics management;\n- a worsening in the terms and conditions upon which we engage with our manufacturers and source suppliers, whether resulting from broader local or global conditions or dynamics specific to our relationships with such parties;\n- the impact of unfavorable global or regional economic conditions and related economic slowdowns or recessions, low consumer confidence, high\n- unemployment, weak credit or capital markets, budget deficits, burdensome government debt, austerity measures, higher interest rates, higher taxes, international trade disputes, government restrictions, geopolitical instability, higher inflation, or deflation;\n- failure to meet our announced guidance or market expectations and the impact thereof;\n- failure to attract or retain key executive or partner talent or successfully transition executives;\n- the impacts of partner investments and changes in the availability and cost of labor, including any union organizing efforts and our responses to such efforts;\n- the impact of foreign currency translation, particularly a stronger U.S. dollar;\n- the impact of, and our ability to respond to, substantial competition from new entrants, consolidations by competitors, and other competitive activities, such as pricing actions (including price reductions, promotions, discounting, couponing, or free goods), marketing, category expansion, product introductions, or entry or expansion in our geographic markets;\n- potential impacts of climate change;\n- evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations;\n- the potential impact of activist shareholder actions or tactics;",

Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $625 million and $359 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Automotive Leasing\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\n\n## Services and Other\n\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs of retail merchandise sales.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $756 million and $115 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to affect tax able income. V aluation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax  assets to the amount expected to be realized.",

      "answer": "AMZN includes 'Other operating expense (income), net' as part of its consolidated operating expenses and highlights its inclusion in segment reporting reviewed by the CODM, indicating it is a meaningful component of performance evaluation. BKNG reports a $5 million 'Other operating expenses' in 2023, a significant shift from a $199 million expense in 2022, suggesting a major reduction or reversal of costs. SBUX reports $280.9 million in 'Other operating expenses' for 2023, representing a consistent 1.0% of North America Total Net Revenues compared to the prior year. Together, these figures show how each company treats 'Other Operating Expenses' in terms of materiality, trend direction, and alignment with revenue, reflecting differences in operational focus and cost structure.",

        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Other Operating Expenses: AMZN includes 'Other operating expense (income), net' as a line item in its consolidated operating expenses and notes that it is reviewed by the CODM as part of segment performance, indicating its strategic importance in financial reporting.",
        "Hop 2: BKNG \u2192 Other Operating Expenses: BKNG reports $5 million in 'Other operating expenses' for 2023, a reversal from a $199 million expense in 2022, signaling a significant year-over-year change in this cost category.",
        "Hop 3: SBUX \u2192 Other Operating Expenses: SBUX reports $280.9 million in 'Other operating expenses' for 2023, which remains consistent at 1.0% of North America Total Net Revenues, showing stability in this expense relative to revenue."

      "answer": "BKNG discusses long-term investments in the context of impairment risks, particularly citing a 2020 impairment charge related to its investment in DiDi Global Inc., which negatively impacted its results of operations. MCD approaches long-term investments from a hedging perspective, using foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, with $12.8 billion in foreign currency-denominated debt in 2021. SBUX provides a detailed fair value breakdown of its long-term investments, which include $281.7 million in available-for-sale debt securities, with specific allocations across corporate debt, foreign government obligations, and U.S. treasury securities. Together, these approaches show that BKNG is focused on mitigating impairment risks, MCD emphasizes currency risk hedging, and SBUX maintains a diversified and transparent portfolio of long-term investments.",

          "chunk_text": "multiple companies providing a similar service and instead prefer to use one or a limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity. As a result, the consumer experience with mobile apps as well as brand recognition and loyalty continue to be increasingly important. Our mobile offerings have received generally strong reviews and are driving a material and increasing share of our business. We believe that mobile bookings are necessary to maintain and grow our business as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices instead of a personal computer. As a result, it is increasingly important for us to develop and maintain effective mobile platforms to provide consumers with an appealing, easy-to-use mobile experience and that the features of our mobile platforms are competitive with our peers. If we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly, and differentiated mobile offerings, and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if our mobile offerings are not used by consumers, we could lose market share and our business, future growth, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nGoogle's Android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world. As a result, Google has the ability to leverage its Android operating system to give its travel services a competitive advantage, either technically or with prominence on its Google Play app store or within its mobile search results. Further, Google is the leading internet search service and has leveraged its search popularity to promote its travel services. Although Google has faced legal challenges in Europe and the United States under various anticompetition laws, including in respect of giving its own services and products preferential treatment in the online search market, it is not yet clear how or whether these actions will further affect Google's business, including its travel services.\n\nApple has substantial market share in the smartphone market and controls integration of offerings, including travel services, into its mobile operating system. Apple also has more experience producing and developing mobile apps and has access to greater resources than we have. Apple may use or expand its existing and potential mobile apps such as Wallet, Siri (Apple's voice recognition \"concierge\" service), Apple Pay (Apple's mobile payment system), or another mobile app or functionality as a means of entering the online travel reservations marketplace. To the extent Google or Apple use their mobile operating systems, app distribution channels or, in the case of Google, search services, to favor their own travel service offerings, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nImpairments of goodwill, long-term investments, and long-lived assets, increases in provisions for expected credit losses on receivables from and cash advances made to our travel service provider and restaurant partners, and increases in cash outlays to refund consumers for prepaid reservations have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nAs a result of the deterioration of our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 we recorded goodwill impairment charges in our Kayak and OpenTable reporting unit and in our investment in DiDi Global, Inc. (\"DiDi\"). Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK, particularly the assumptions related to the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery, and the performance of the businesses during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in a need to recognize an additional goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Notes 5, 6 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the impairment charges.\n\nIn addition, in 2020, given the severe downturn in the global travel industry and the financial difficulties faced by many of our travel service provider and restaurant partners and marketing affiliates, we increased our provision for expected credit losses on receivables from and prepayments to our travel service provider and restaurant partners and marketing affiliates. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Due to the high level of cancellations of existing reservations, we incurred higher than normal cash outlays to refund consumers for prepaid reservations. In some instances, we did not estimate a recovery of prepayment already made to a travel service provider where we had agreed to provide free cancellations to consumers for non-refundable reservations. Any significant increase in our provision for expected credit losses and any significant increase in cash outlays to refund consumers would have a corresponding adverse effect on our results of operations and related cash flows. In certain instances, we may offer cancellable room rates on behalf of a partner to provide flexibility to our consumers even if the partner has not provided a cancellable room rate, which could have a negative impact on our revenues if we are unable to facilitate booking from another customer.\n\nWe are dependent on providers of accommodations, rental cars, and airline tickets and on restaurants.\n\nWe rely on providers of accommodations, rental cars, and airline tickets and on restaurants to make their services available to consumers through us. Our arrangements with travel service providers generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of accommodation reservations, rental cars, or airline tickets, or to make accommodation reservations, rental cars, or airline tickets available in any geographic area, for any particular route, or at any particular price. Similarly, our arrangements with restaurants generally do not require them to provide all of their available tables and",

See reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1.\n\n(2) Based on debt obligations before the effects of fair value hedging adjustments and deferred debt costs. These effects are excluded as they have no impact on the obligation at maturity. See the Debt Financing footnote on page 57 of this Form 10-K.\n\n(3) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps used to hedge debt.\n\nStandard &amp; Poor's and Moody's currently rate the Company's commercial paper A-2 and P-2, respectively, and its long-term debt BBB+ and Baa1, respectively. To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings.\n\nCertain of the Company's debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company's debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company's business. In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $15 billion of borrowing capacity with no specified expiration date, of which $8.3 billion remains outstanding as of December 31, 2021. These borrowings may include (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In April 2020, the Company's Board of Directors provided additional authorization to issue commercial paper and draw on lines of credit agreements up to $8 billion in addition to the $15 billion authorized as referenced above. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the SEC and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $4.5 billion available under committed line of credit agreements (see the Debt Financing footnote on page 57 of this Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2021, the Company's subsidiaries also had $263 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.\n\nThe Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments.\n\nIn managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders' equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $12.8 billion and $13.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company's restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies footnote related to financial instruments and hedging activities on page 47 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.\n\nThe Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2021 , neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.",

      "question": "How do HD, LOW, and TSLA each disclose their treatment of finance lease assets and liabilities, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to capital structure and asset financing?",
      "answer": "HD provides a detailed breakdown of its finance lease assets and liabilities, showing a decrease in finance lease assets from $2,840 million in 2024 to $2,638 million in 2025, and corresponding long-term finance lease liabilities of $2,749 million in 2025. LOW discloses that its finance lease assets are net of accumulated amortization, which increased from $326 million in 2024 to $373 million in 2025, indicating ongoing amortization of these assets. TSLA, in contrast, highlights the cash flows associated with finance leases, showing only $21 million in interest payments in 2024 and $144 million in leased assets obtained through finance lease liabilities, suggesting a more limited use of finance leases compared to operating leases. Together, these disclosures show that HD and LOW rely more significantly on finance leases as part of their capital structure, while TSLA favors operating leases, reflecting different strategic approaches to asset financing.",

      "answer": "BKNG reported a decrease in its total Net Carrying Amount of intangible assets from $1,829 million in 2022 to $1,613 million in 2023, indicating a reduction in asset value or potential write-downs. GM also experienced a decline, with its Net Carrying Amount falling from $3,034 million in 2022 to $2,941 million in 2023, suggesting moderate amortization pressure across its intangible portfolio. In contrast, HD saw a significant increase in its Net Carrying Amount, rising from $3,323 million in 2022 to $3,606 million in 2023, pointing to either acquisitions or revaluation of definite-lived assets. These trends suggest BKNG and GM are managing asset depreciation more actively, while HD is expanding or strengthening its intangible asset base.",

NKE reports state tax expenses of $201 million in 2024, which is part of a total income tax expense of $1,000 million, showing a moderate impact with a notable deferral component.

NKE reported demand creation expense of $3.85B in 2022, maintaining a consistent investment relative to its $46.7B revenue, suggesting a mature brand strategy. SBUX, while not disclosing exact figures, highlights increasing marketing spend in its 2022 filing, aligning with its global brand expansion efforts. Together, this reflects differing brand investment intensities across growth stages within the consumer discretionary sector.",

Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users' ex perience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people's lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\n\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders' interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.8 billion and 10.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating ex penses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.\n\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\n\nFor additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.'\n\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 in Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.'\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States ('GAAP') requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.' Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value.

We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV). This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During fiscal 2024, our reserve decreased approximately $23 million to $222 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During fiscal 2024, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  The majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for inventory during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our LCNRV inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2024. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.  However, substantially all receivables",

W ithin the context of these critical accounting estim ates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circum stances that would result in m aterially different am ounts being reported.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nProvisions for anticipated sales returns consist of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\nEstim ates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claim s are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from  custom ers and outstanding discounts and claim s and (3) estim ated returns, discounts and claim s expected but not yet finalized with custom ers. Actual returns, discounts and claim s in any future period are inherently uncertain and m ay differ from  estim ates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claim s were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determ ination was m ade.\n\nRefer to N ote 14 - R evenues in the accom panying N otes to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents for additional inform ation.\n\n## INVENTORY RESERVES\n\nWe make ongoing estim ates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assum ptions about future dem and and m arket conditions. If we estim ate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estim ated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to C ost of sales. If changes in m arket conditions result in reductions to the estim ated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estim ate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we m ade such a determ ination.\n\n## HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES\n\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency m onetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been m et, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other com prehensive incom e (loss), rather than N et incom e, until the underlying hedged transaction affects N et incom e. In m ost cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from  Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) into N et incom e som etim e after the m aturity of the derivative. O ne of the criteria for this accounting treatm ent is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated am ount of anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estim ates of anticipated transactions m ay fluctuate over tim e and m ay ultim ately vary from  actual transactions. W hen the designated am ount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified tim e period or within an additional two-m onth period of tim e thereafter, we reclassify the cum ulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from  Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) to Other (incom e) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circum stances, the additional period of tim e m ay exceed two m onths due to extenuating circum stances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.\n\nRefer to N ote 12 - R isk M anagem ent and D erivatives in the accom panying N otes to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents for additional inform ation.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nWe are subject to taxation in the U nited States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. T he determ ination of our provision for incom e taxes requires significant judgm ent, the use of estim ates and the interpretation and application of com plex tax laws. O n an interim  basis, we estim ate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. T his estim ated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Incom e before incom e taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual item s, to determ ine the year-to-date Incom e tax expense. The incom e tax effects of infrequent or unusual item s are recognized in the interim  period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estim ate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estim ation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. W hen this occurs, we adjust the incom e tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estim ate occurs.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the am ount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circum stances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.

Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\n\n## Financing Obligations\n\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.\n\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\n\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See 'Note 5 - Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.'\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $6.8 billion and $10.7 billion.",

The majority of our merchandise inv entories are stated at the lower of cost or market, as determined by the retail inv entory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inv entory losses (or shrink). As the inv entory retail v alue is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, inv entory v alued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Our remaining merchandise inv entories, including those within our retail operations in Canada and Mexico, distribution centers, and SRS, are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable v alue, as determined by a cost method, primarily the first-in, first-out method. We evaluate the inv entory v alued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the adjustments recorded to merchandise inv entories v alued under a cost method were not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\n\nPhysical inv entory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in our stores, distribution centers and branches to ensure that amounts reflected in merchandise inv entories are properly stated. Shrink (or in the case of excess inv entory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inv entory and the physical inv entory count. We calculate shrink based on actual inv entory losses identified as a result of physical inv entory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inv entory losses occurring between physical inv entory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inv entory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inv entory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nBuildings and related improv ements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method ov er their estimated useful liv es. Leasehold improv ements and assets held under finance leases are amortized using the straight-line method ov er the original term of the lease or the useful life of the asset, whichev er is shorter.\n\nThe following table presents the estimated useful liv es of our property and equipment:\n\n",

      "answer": "AMZN reports that its provision for income taxes was positively impacted by increasing excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, which totaled $1.9 billion in 2021. BKNG highlights that excess tax benefits are recognized as a discrete item in the income statement and are presented as operating cash flows, indicating the significance of stock-based compensation in its overall tax position. SBUX shows that excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation reduced its effective tax rate by 0.5 percentage points in fiscal 2022, down from a 0.9-point reduction in 2021. Together, these disclosures suggest that all three firms benefit from stock-based compensation tax advantages, but they experience and report these benefits differently based on their equity compensation scale, vesting schedules, and tax planning strategies.",

Our tax provision includes $1.4 billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.9 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\n(2) U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is referred to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction ('FDII').\n\nOur provision for income taxes in 2020 was higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was partially offset by the impact of developments in our ongoing global tax controversies on taxes related to our foreign earnings and losses, an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and an increase in our foreign income deduction under FDII. In addition, our Luxembourg operations generated earnings in 2020 and utilized deferred tax assets previously subject to valuation allowances.\n\nOur provision for income taxes in 2021 was higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was partially offset by an increase in U.S. federal research and development credits and the impact of the distribution of certain intangible assets from Luxembourg to the U.S. in Q4 2021, resulting in the utilization of $2.6 billion of Luxembourg deferred tax assets previously subject to a valuation allowance.\n\nWe intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.",

Marketing expenses consist of performance marketing expenses and brand marketing expenses. Performance marketing expenses are expenses generally measured by return on investment or an increase in bookings over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of the costs of: (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2) referrals from meta-search and travel research websites; (3) affiliate programs; (4) offline and online brand marketing; and (5) other performance-based marketing and incentives. Performance marketing expenses are recognized as incurred. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued performance marketing liabilities of $306 million and $156 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Brand marketing expenses are expenses incurred to build brand awareness over a specified time period. These expenses consist primarily of television advertising and online video and display advertising (including the airing of the Company's television advertising online), as well as other marketing expenses such as public relations and sponsorships. Brand marketing expenses are generally recognized as incurred with the exception of advertising production costs, which are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is displayed or broadcast.\n\n## Sales and Other Expenses\n\nSales and other expenses are generally variable in nature and consist primarily of: (1) credit cards and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to third parties that provide call center, website content translations, and other services; (3) chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions; (4) customer relations costs; and (5) provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to accommodation commission receivables and prepayments to certain customers.\n\n## Personnel\n\nPersonnel expenses consist of compensation to the Company's personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee health and other benefits. Included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accrued compensation liabilities of $421 million and $333 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to performance share units, restricted stock units and stock options is recognized based on fair value on a straight-line basis over the respective requisite service periods and forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. The fair value on the grant date of performance share units and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of units granted and the quoted price of the Company's common stock. For performance share units with market conditions, the effect of the market condition is also considered in the determination of fair value on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. The fair value of employee stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model.\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards using its estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets or performance goals, as applicable). The Company periodically adjusts the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results or expected achievement of performance goals, as applicable.\n\nThe benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs are recognized in the income statement as a discrete item when an option exercise or a vesting and release of shares occurs. Excess tax benefits are presented as operating cash flows and cash payments for employee statutory tax withholding related to vested stock awards are presented as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information related to stock-based awards.",

The decrease in total sales was primarily driven by the decrease in comparable sales. Comparable sales decreased 2.7% over the same period, driven by a 3.0% decline in comparable customer transactions, and a 0.3% increase in comparable average ticket. Comparable sales change during each quarter of the fiscal year, as reported, were declines of 4.1% in the first quarter, 5.1% in the second quarter, 1.1% in the third quarter, and an increase of 0.2% in the fourth quarter.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, we had comparable sales increases in Building Materials. An additional four product categories performed above the Company average, including Hardware, Rough Plumbing, Appliances, and Millwork. Strength in Building Materials reflects strong demand from Pro customers. Our DIY customer categories were impacted by lower DIY discretionary demand, particularly in bigger-ticket interior projects.\n\nGross Margin - Gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2024 decreased seven basis points compared to fiscal 2023. The gross margin decrease for the year was primarily driven by investments in our supply chain, partially offset by productivity initiatives.\n\nSG&amp;A - SG&amp;A expense for fiscal 2024 deleveraged 72 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2023. This was primarily driven by employee compensation and benefits, due to higher bonus attainment and employee insurance costs, as well as cycling favorable legal settlements in the prior year.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization expense deleveraged eight basis points for fiscal 2024 as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nInterest - Net - Net interest ex pense is comprised of the following:\n\n",

Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

In addition, we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During 2021, our reserve decreased approximately $14 million to $168 million as of January 28, 2022.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During 2021, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $49 million to $414 million as of January 28, 2022, in response to higher volumes and estimated shrinkage rates based on results from previous physical inventories.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments or promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  Many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are",

SBUX reports an expected term of 8.1 years for stock options granted in 2022, indicating a more data-driven approach based on historical exercise behavior. TSLA does not explicitly disclose its expected term assumption for stock options, but it does mention a four-year vesting period for stock options and RSUs, suggesting that its expected term may align closely with this vesting schedule.

No stock options were granted to the executive officers of the Company. Stock options granted or assumed in acquisitions generally have a term of 10 years from the grant date. The fair value of stock options granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. The use of an option pricing model requires the use of several assumptions including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected term. Expected volatility is based on the Company's historical volatility over the expected term of the option and implied volatility of publicly traded options of the Company's common stock. The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until option exercise. Since the Company has limited historical stock option exercise experience, the Company used the simplified method in estimating the expected term, which is calculated as the average of the sum of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues at the time of grant for the expected term of the option.\n\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used to value options granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 using the Black-Scholes options pricing model:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe adopted ASC 842, Leases, as of January 1, 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach ('adoption of the new lease standard'). In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed us to carry forward the historical determination of contracts as leases, lease classification and not reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements. The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs\n\nMarketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Marketing, promotional and advertising costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income ('GILTI') earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance.\n\n## Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nComprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on marketable securities that have been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.",
