Organic sales increased high single digits in G rooming, mid-single digits in Fabric &amp; Home Care and Health Care and low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care.\n- Operating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion related to the Gillette intangible asset.\n- Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax  rate. Foreign ex change impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million.\n- Net earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n- Diluted EPS increased 2% to $6.02 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the G illette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring charges, increased 12% to $6.59.\n- Cash flow from operating activities was $19.8 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital ex penditures and certain other impacts, was $16.9 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the G illette intangible asset impairment charge and a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105%.",

Organic sales in Europe increased 6.7% in 2024. Organic sales growth was led by Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Poland.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Europe in 2024 versus 2023 was primarily due to increases in Oral Care and Personal Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste category. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the body wash category.\n\nOperating profit in Europe increased 15% in 2024 to $658, or 140 bps to 23.7% as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (370 bps), partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative ex pense (230 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in G ross profit was due to cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (290 bps), higher pricing and favorable mix (70 bps), partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (100 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased advertising investment (220 bps).",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola's capital expenditure in Latin America was $4 million in 2022, while PepsiCo's capital spending in the region was $837 million in 2024. This significant disparity suggests that PepsiCo is prioritizing Latin America more heavily for infrastructure and growth initiatives compared to Coca-Cola, which may reflect differing strategic focuses in emerging markets.",

        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 LatAm: Coca-Cola reported a capital expenditure of $4 million in Latin America in 2022, indicating minimal investment in the region.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's net sales growth for fiscal 2023 was negatively impacted by foreign exchange, which reduced growth by 2% overall. This foreign exchange impact is specifically highlighted in the detailed breakdown of net sales performance. In contrast, Philip Morris's financial metrics show a foreign exchange-related deferred tax asset of $149 million at the end of 2023, indicating a different exposure or accounting treatment related to currency fluctuations. While PG experienced a direct drag on sales growth, PM reflects foreign exchange effects through its deferred tax assets, suggesting differing financial impacts and strategies for managing currency risk.",

This contrast suggests that while Colgate experienced stronger underlying growth in consumer demand across its global markets, Sam's Club faced more moderate growth, potentially due to macroeconomic pressures or competitive dynamics in the U.S. retail club sector.",

Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. Our net sales and gross profit margin are influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales.\n\nWe expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to inflationary trends; tariffs and trade restrictions; fluctuations in global currencies; swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; and supply chain pressures, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to \"Results of Operations\" below.\n\n## Company Performance Metrics\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows:\n\n- Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;\n- Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and\n- Returns - improve our Return on Investment through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend.\n\n## Growth\n\nOur objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club U.S. and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy.\n\nComparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We report on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.\n\nCalendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2025 and 2024, were as follows:\n\n",

Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble's Beauty segment experienced 2% net sales growth and 2% organic sales growth in the same period. This suggests that while Walmart prioritized expense leverage to support growth, P&G's Beauty segment pursued a more modest revenue expansion strategy with limited organic growth, potentially reflecting differing market dynamics and strategic priorities in their respective sectors.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported a total company net sales growth of 2% in 2024, driven primarily by price increases across multiple categories. In contrast, Sam's Club U.S. reported a sales growth of 2.3% in fiscal 2024, which was lower than Walmart U.S.'s 5.5% growth. This suggests that while consumer demand remains resilient in the broader U.S. retail market, warehouse clubs like Sam's Club are experiencing more modest growth, potentially indicating a shift in consumer preference toward value and bulk purchasing but at a slower pace than the general retail environment.",

Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\n\n## Segments\n\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites and mobile applications, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), the Company's Chief Executive Officer, regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club U.S. segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omnichannel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.",

      "question": "How might PM's current year net losses, which are being amortized and impact pension obligations, affect its long-term pension funding strategy compared to MO's disclosed multi-year pension liability payments?",
      "answer": "PM's 2023 financial statements show $18 million in net losses being amortized, a significant decrease from $181 million in 2022 and $314 million in 2021, indicating a reduction in pension-related losses over time. These losses directly impact pension obligations, as noted in the disclosures where total net (losses) gains for pensions amount to $2,325 million. Meanwhile, MO discloses multi-year pension liability payments totaling $494 million in 2024, with cumulative obligations reaching $2,362 million from 2029-2033. This suggests MO has larger near- and medium-term pension funding commitments than PM's current amortization schedule indicates, potentially pointing to differing pension funding strategies or liability structures between the two companies.",

      "question": "How does the 5% organic sales growth in Procter & Gamble's Fabric & Home Care segment compare with Costco's strategy for achieving net sales growth across its global warehouse operations?",
      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Fabric & Home Care segment achieved a 5% organic sales growth in fiscal 2023, driven by strong execution and pricing strategies in a category that contributed meaningfully to P&G's overall 2% net sales growth. This growth was part of a broader trend where P&G saw mid-single-digit increases across multiple segments. In contrast, Costco's strategy for driving net sales growth focuses on high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover through low prices, efficient distribution, and reduced handling costs in a no-frills warehouse model. Costco also leverages its membership-based retail structure and e-commerce expansion across 12 international markets to sustain growth, with an emphasis on maintaining low gross margins while benefiting from early payment discounts and efficient cash flow management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PG \u2192 Fabric & Home Care: P&G reported mid-single-digit increases in the Fabric & Home Care segment, with organic sales growth at 5% as shown in the detailed financial table.",
        "Hop 2: Fabric & Home Care \u2192 Net Sales Growth: The segment's 5% organic growth was a contributor to P&G's overall 2% net sales growth for the year, indicating its relative importance in the company's growth strategy.",
        "Hop 3: Net Sales Growth \u2190 COST: Costco's strategy for achieving net sales growth centers on operational efficiencies, membership retention, and rapid inventory turnover, as detailed in its 10-K filing, with global warehouse expansion and e-commerce playing a key role."

      "answer": "TGT reported a change in pension obligations during 2022, with its pension-related accumulated other comprehensive loss decreasing from $735 million to $583 million, a reduction of $152 million. This change would have affected TGT\u2019s deferred income tax position, as pension-related losses typically generate tax deferrals. PM\u2019s data shows that pension-related deferred income taxes were $570 million in 2022, indicating that a significant portion of pension losses can be offset through tax deferrals. MO, on the other hand, experienced a much larger impact from deferred income taxes in its accumulated other comprehensive loss statements. In 2022, MO\u2019s deferred income taxes affected its benefit plans by $115 million and its ABI segment by $352 million, totaling $467 million. This suggests that MO\u2019s tax management strategy involves more active utilization of pension-related tax deferrals across multiple segments compared to TGT. The contrast in deferred tax impacts reveals that while both companies manage pension obligations, MO appears to leverage tax deferrals more aggressively in its financial reporting.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported a 2.9% compensation increase rate for 2023, which is notably lower than The Coca-Cola Company's consistent 3.75% rate over the same period. This contrast is particularly interesting given that companies like UPS experienced a decline in their compensation increase rate, dropping from 4.29% in 2022 to 3.25% in 2023. This suggests that while some companies are maintaining or even increasing their compensation trends, others are either moderating increases or experiencing downward pressure, potentially reflecting different strategies or industry-specific dynamics.",

      "question": "How might MO's reclassification of pension costs affect its approach to pension liability management compared to PM's successful reduction of pension liabilities between 2020 and 2021, given the substantial future pension obligations both companies face?",
      "answer": "PM reduced its pension liabilities from $3,497 million in 2020 to $1,661 million in 2021, indicating a significant de-risking effort. In contrast, MO reclassified $159 million in pension-related net losses as part of its net periodic benefit cost in 2022, suggesting ongoing pension cost volatility. Given the projected future pension obligations (e.g., $1,110 million in 2022, declining to $960 million in 2023 and 2024 before rising again), MO's reclassification practices may signal a different strategy for managing pension exposure compared to PM's liability reduction. This contrast implies that MO may be relying more on accounting adjustments to manage pension impacts, while PM has taken more direct action to reduce its pension burden, which could have differing implications for long-term financial stability.",

      "answer": "MDLZ's net pricing improvements in 2022, which included carryover impacts from 2021 and new pricing actions due to input cost increases, contributed positively to its operating income. Despite this, MDLZ's operating income margin still declined from 16.2% in 2021 to 11.2% in 2022 due to factors such as higher acquisition-related costs, the impact of the European Commission legal matter, and increased input costs. In contrast, CL faced specific charges that directly constrained its operating profit: a $267 million legal charge related to a retirement plan recalculation, a $25 million impact from a product recall, and a $721 million non-cash goodwill impairment tied to the Filorga business, exacerbated by the lingering effects of the pandemic and higher interest rates. These contrasting dynamics highlight how MDLZ leveraged pricing to offset cost pressures, while CL grappled with one-time charges and impairment losses that weighed on profitability.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ \u2192 Net Pricing: MDLZ experienced higher net pricing in 2022, which included carryover effects from 2021 and new pricing actions due to rising input costs, helping to offset some of the margin pressures.",

      "answer": "Philip Morris reported a $14 million net loss from post-retirement benefits in 2024, contributing to a total of $2,204 million in net losses across pension, post-retirement, and post-employment benefits. In contrast, Coca-Cola disclosed $217 million in net unrealized gains on equity securities still held at the end of 2024. While both figures reflect exposure to financial market volatility, Philip Morris' liability-driven losses indicate sensitivity to discount rate and market return assumptions, whereas Coca-Cola's unrealized gains suggest a more direct exposure to equity market performance.",

      "answer": "PG's Grooming segment achieved 5% organic sales growth in fiscal 2022, driven by strong execution of pricing and product availability despite inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, COST emphasized that net sales growth, particularly comparable sales, is central to leveraging SG&A costs and enhancing profitability. COST actively managed inflation by selectively absorbing cost increases, purchasing in bulk earlier than usual, and maintaining competitive pricing to preserve member perception of value. This reveals that while PG focused on segment-specific organic growth through grooming innovation and pricing discipline, COST prioritized broad-based traffic and basket size growth through strategic pricing and cost management, even at the expense of gross margin percentage in some cases.",

MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes  to  Financial  Statements  (Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K).  This  section  generally  discusses  the  results  of operations for  2022  compared to 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition  for  2021  compared  to  2020  refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  our  fiscal  year  2021  Form  10-K,  which  was  filed  with  the  United  States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline,  pharmacy,  optical,  food  court,  hearing  aids,  and  tire  installation)  and  other  businesses  (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members  and  the  amount  they  spend  on  each  visit  (average  ticket).  Sales  comparisons  can  also  be  particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international  operations);  inflation  and  changes  in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions.  The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&amp;A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins  are  also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a  wide  range  of  global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or  reliably  predict  general  economic  health  or  changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term  on  maximizing  prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our members of our 'pricing authority' - consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlierthan-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost  increases  on  to  our  members.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  may  include  reducing  prices  on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).\n\nWe  believe  our  gasoline  business  enhances  traffic  in  our  warehouses,  but  it  generally  has  a  lower  gross  margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&amp;A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-",

      "answer": "PEP allocated $461 million toward capital spending in Latin America in 2021, despite the region's declining revenue contribution, which fell to 5% in 2021 from 7% in 2019. This reflects a continued strategic emphasis on infrastructure and operational investment in the region even as its top-line contribution has waned. In contrast, KO's disclosures indicate a more cautious approach to capital spending in emerging markets, where asset recoverability and impairment risks are a central concern due to economic and political uncertainties. KO emphasizes significant management judgment in assessing long-term returns, including factors like sales volume, inflation, and supply chain stability before committing to capital outlays. This suggests KO may be more selective or conservative in emerging market investments compared to PEP's sustained capital deployment in Latin America.",

          "chunk_text": "variable interest is referred to as a 'VIE.' An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are accounted for as consolidated entities.\n\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.\n\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\n\n## Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets\n\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading 'Our Business - Challenges and Risks' above and 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in various regions around the world.\n\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\n\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers' financial condition. These factors are even more difficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic and any resurgences of the pandemic, including, but not limited to, the number of people contracting the virus; the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing requirements; the impact of governmental actions across the globe to contain the virus; vaccine availability, rates of vaccination and effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variants of the virus; governmental or other vaccine mandates and any associated business and supply chain disruptions; and the substance and pace of the economic recovery. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. While uncertainties still exist, we expect to see continued improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available, as vaccination rates increase, and as consumers return to many of their previous work routines as well as socializing and traveling. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets that are more dependent on cash flows generated in the away-fromhome channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas that are more heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are therefore more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. If we had used other assumptions and estimates when tests of these assets were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions.

      "question": "How does the contribution of price increases to Grooming segment growth at PG compare to the impact of pricing strategies on MO's oral tobacco business performance in 2024?",
      "answer": "At PG, price increases contributed 8% to the Grooming segment's net sales growth, which was a key driver of its 4% overall segment growth. In contrast, at MO, higher pricing contributed $221 million to net revenue growth in the oral tobacco business, though this was partially offset by volume declines and product mix shifts. While both companies leveraged pricing strategies to drive revenue, PG's Grooming segment saw a more balanced growth contribution from pricing and volume, whereas MO's results were more heavily influenced by pricing with countervailing volume pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PG \u2192 Grooming: PG's Grooming segment experienced 4% net sales growth, with 8% contribution from price increases despite a 5% headwind from foreign exchange.",
        "Hop 2: Grooming \u2192 Price Increase: Price increases were a significant driver in the Grooming segment\u2019s net sales growth, contributing 8 percentage points before accounting for foreign exchange effects.",
        "Hop 3: Price Increase \u2190 MO: MO reported that higher pricing contributed $221 million to net revenue growth in its oral tobacco segment, despite lower shipment volume and mix effects."

Organic sales increased high single digits in G rooming, mid-single digits in Fabric &amp; Home Care and Health Care and low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care.\n- Operating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion related to the Gillette intangible asset.\n- Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax  rate. Foreign ex change impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million.\n- Net earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n- Diluted EPS increased 2% to $6.02 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the G illette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring charges, increased 12% to $6.59.\n- Cash flow from operating activities was $19.8 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital ex penditures and certain other impacts, was $16.9 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the G illette intangible asset impairment charge and a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105%.",

      "answer": "The devaluation of the Argentine peso contributed to a $1,096 million unfavorable currency translation impact on MDLZ's 2024 net revenue, primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the peso. This reflects a significant exposure to FX volatility in emerging markets. In comparison, Philip Morris disclosed a $264 million negative foreign exchange impact on its deferred income tax liabilities, highlighting similar FX risks. Additionally, Merck\u2019s 2024 results showed that the Argentine peso alone accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of negative foreign exchange impact, further illustrating the broad impact of peso devaluation across multinational firms. Thus, MDLZ faced a quantifiably larger FX headwind compared to PM and industry peers.",

Organic sales in Africa/Eurasia increased 7.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Turkiye, Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to an increase in Oral Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste and manual toothbrush categories.\n\nOperating profit in Africa/Eurasia decreased 1% in 2021 to $203, or 160 bps to 19.4% of Net sales. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit (170 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (60 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (590 bps), partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company's fundingthe-growth initiatives (190 bps). This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to decreased advertising investment (140 bps), partially offset by higher overhead expenses (80 bps), primarily driven by higher logistics costs.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola reported $4,647 million in buildings and improvements for 2023, which are depreciated over the shorter of 35 years or useful life according to standard industry frameworks. This long depreciation horizon implies a slower recognition of costs on financial statements, potentially preserving near-term earnings but locking in capital expenditure commitments over a long horizon. In contrast, Procter & Gamble's pension and OPRB liabilities are highly sensitive to discount rate assumptions, with a 100 basis point change affecting annual after-tax benefit/expense by $85 million for pensions and $30 million for OPRB. PG's approach allows for more dynamic financial adjustments to long-term obligations based on market conditions, unlike KO's more fixed depreciation trajectory. Thus, KO may face less financial flexibility in adapting to changing economic environments compared to PG, which recalibrates its liability assumptions more frequently based on external factors.",

In contrast, Procter & Gamble's Fabric & Home Care segment, in which P&G has a direct stake, saw its earnings before income taxes grow from $5,729 million in 2022 to $6,303 million in 2023, reflecting an increase of $976 million over that period.

      "question": "How did MDLZ's partial-year contribution from the divested packaged seafood business impact its 2021 net revenue growth compared to PM's net revenue volatility from derivatives reclassified into earnings, considering the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions and volume recovery post-pandemic?",
      "answer": "MDLZ's 2021 net revenue growth received a 0.6 percentage point boost from the partial-year contribution of the packaged seafood business, which was acquired in April 2021 and divested in November 2021. This contributed $35 million in incremental net revenues before the divestiture. The growth was further supported by input cost-driven pricing actions and volume recovery in key markets as pandemic impacts subsided. In contrast, PM experienced net revenue volatility due to derivatives, with $59 million reclassified from other comprehensive earnings into net revenues in 2021, compared to a $3 million reclassification in 2020. This indicates that while MDLZ benefited from short-term revenue contributions and strategic pricing amid volume recovery, PM faced more fluctuation in revenues due to its derivative activities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MDLZ \u2192 Business Divestiture: MDLZ acquired and later divested the packaged seafood business in 2021, contributing $35 million in net revenues before the divestiture and adding 0.6 percentage points to overall net revenue growth.",
        "Hop 2: Business Divestiture \u2192 Net Revenues: The partial-year contribution of the divested business was a direct factor in MDLZ's revenue performance, reflecting strategic portfolio adjustments and favorable volume recovery post-pandemic in categories like chocolate, biscuits, and gum.",
        "Hop 3: Net Revenues \u2190 PM: PM's net revenues were impacted by derivatives reclassified from other comprehensive earnings, with $59 million in 2021 compared to -$3 million in 2020, introducing volatility unrelated to core business performance."

Overall, we continued to see increased demand for our snack category products, though parts of our business were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped strong volume growth in 2020 resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, sales of our gum and candy products grew as out-of-home consumption continued to recover, as did our world travel business as global travel improved, though still below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable currency translation and incremental net revenues from acquisitions also added to revenue growth in 2021.\n\nOrganic Net Revenue growth was driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing. Favorable volume/mix in Europe, AMEA and Latin America was primarily driven by strong volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets. This was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America as the region lapped very strong prior-year volume growth from significant food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021. Favorable currency impacts",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

(e)\n\nMerchandise sales - We record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store. Total revenues do not include sales tax because  we  are  a  pass-through  conduit  for  collecting  and  remitting  sales  taxes.  Generally,  guests  may  return  national  brand merchandise within 90 days of purchase and owned and exclusive brands within one year of purchase. Sales are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns and our expectation of future returns. As of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, the liability for estimated returns was $165 million and $139 million, respectively.\n\nWe routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Under the vast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record revenue and related costs gross. We concluded that we are the principal in these transactions for a number of reasons, most notably because we 1) control the overall economics of the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide goods to the customer. Merchandise received under these arrangements is not included in Inventory because the purchase and sale of this inventory are virtually simultaneous.\n\nRevenue from Target gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of issuance. Our gift cards  do  not  expire.  Based  on  historical  redemption  rates,  a  small  and  relatively  stable  percentage  of  gift  cards  will  never  be redeemed,  referred  to  as  \"breakage.\"  Estimated  breakage  revenue  is  recognized  over  time  in  proportion  to  actual  gift  card redemptions.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our ESG programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&amp;I strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. We are strengthening our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, eCommerce and data and analytics enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. In particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.\n\nWe are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.\n\nThe investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. We also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative'). The program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2022, is projected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $200 and $240, which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is estimated that approximately 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. For more information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, see 'Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges' below.\n\n## Significant Items Impacting Comparability\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash charge of $571 pretax ($518 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible related to the Filorga skin health business. The impairment was due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nIn 1990, our Canadian subsidiary ('CP Canada'), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the 'Canada notes'). In the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75 pretax ($55 aftertax), which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.",

Meanwhile, Philip Morris (PM) identified the Mexican Peso as one of its key foreign currency exposures and actively used derivative contracts to mitigate exchange rate risks. This indicates that while both companies are exposed to the Mexican Peso, PM proactively hedges its exposure, whereas the impact on PEP is evident in its comprehensive loss without explicit mention of similar hedging strategies.",

      "answer": "PM experienced a 2.3% decrease in net revenues (excluding currency and acquisitions), primarily due to an unfavorable pricing variance driven by lower pricing for combustible products in Indonesia. This pricing pressure negatively impacted their net revenues. Given MDLZ's exposure to commodity price volatility and their inability to fully hedge against input cost changes, similar pricing pressures could constrain their ability to maintain or grow net revenues, especially if they are unable to pass on increased costs to consumers without reducing sales volumes.",

Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

      "question": "How does a 25 basis point interest rate change impact Procter & Gamble's foreign investment risk relative to the projected funding obligations for non-U.S. pension plans disclosed by Mondelez in 2022?",
      "answer": "A 25 basis point change in interest rates would have impacted Procter & Gamble's foreign investment risk through its use of interest rate swaps and exposure to derivative instruments, which PG assessed as not materially affecting financial statements. For Mondelez, a similar interest rate sensitivity would influence its non-U.S. pension obligations, where the company projected $5 million annual funding commitments for 2022 through 2026. The interest rate impact on pension expenses for non-U.S. plans, as shown in the sensitivity table, indicates that interest rate fluctuations directly affect long-term liabilities, making both companies sensitive to macroeconomic interest rate shifts, though PG hedges its exposure while MDLZ reflects the cost in pension funding.",

          "chunk_text": "our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.\n\nBased on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2022, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change  in  interest  rates,  at  a  95%  confidence  level  based  on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.\n\nCurrency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange  rates.  Corporate  policy  prescribes  the  range  of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use  forward  contracts  and  currency  swaps  with  maturities  of less than 18 months.\n\nBased on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2022, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change  in  currency  rates  would  not  materially  affect  our financial statements.\n\nCommodity  Price  Exposure  on  Financial  Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather,  supply  conditions,  political  and  economic  variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and  swap  contracts  to  manage  the  volatility  related  to  the above exposures.\n\nAs of and during the years ended June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021,  we  did  not  have  any  financial  commodity  hedging activity.\n\n## Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP\n\nIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding nonrecurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating  decisions,  allocating  financial  resources  and  for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors  as  they  provide  supplemental  information  about business  performance  and  provide  investors  a  view  of  our business  results  through  the  eyes  of  management.  These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These nonGAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP  measures,  but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These nonGAAP  measures  may  not  be  the  same  as  similar  measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and  in  the  items  or  events  being  adjusted.  These  measures include:\n\nOrganic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a  supplemental  understanding  of  underlying  sales  trends  by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\n\nThe following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:\n\n",

We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our ESG programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&amp;I strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. We are strengthening our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, eCommerce and data and analytics enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. In particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.\n\nWe are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.\n\nThe investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. We also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative'). The program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2022, is projected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $200 and $240, which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is estimated that approximately 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. For more information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, see 'Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges' below.\n\n## Significant Items Impacting Comparability\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash charge of $571 pretax ($518 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible related to the Filorga skin health business. The impairment was due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nIn 1990, our Canadian subsidiary ('CP Canada'), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the 'Canada notes'). In the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75 pretax ($55 aftertax), which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) maintained a consistent 3.75% rate of compensation increase across 2021\u20132023 for pension plans. In contrast, Mondelez (MDLZ) showed variation, with a 4.00% rate for U.S. plans and a lower, fluctuating rate of 3.22% (2023), 2.84% (2022), and 3.16% (2021) for Non-U.S. plans. The industry-wide trend, as seen in the intermediate evidence, shows a more variable compensation increase rate (e.g., 1.98% in 2023), suggesting that KO\u2019s strategy is more stable, while MDLZ\u2019s reflects regional differentiation and potential cost control in international markets.",

In contrast, PepsiCo expects higher discount rates to partially offset fixed income losses on plan assets, but still anticipates an net increase in its 2025 pension and retiree medical expense due to settlement charges and asset losses.

The actuarial losses recorded during 2023 for both the U.S. pension and Other retiree benefit plans were primarily a result of a decrease in discount rates applied against future estimated benefit payments that resulted in an increase in the benefit obligation for both the U.S. pension and Other retiree benefit plans.\n\nThe overall investment objective of the plans is to balance risk and return so that obligations to employees are met. The Company evaluates its expected long-term rate of return on plan assets on an annual basis. In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rates of return. The assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. pension plans was 6.50% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Average annual rates of return on plan assets for the U.S. pension plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 5%, 2%, 4%, 6% and 5%, respectively. Similar assessments were performed in determining rates of return on international pension plan assets to arrive at the Company's 2024 weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.69%.\n\nThe medical cost trend rate of increase assumed in measuring the expected cost of benefits is projected to decrease from 7.00% in 2025 to 5.00% by 2030, remaining at 4.50% for the years thereafter.\n\nPension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31 consisted of the following:\n\n",

Subsequent to the transaction close date, the purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reversed $45 million in previously recorded foreign withholding taxes in 2020 after restructuring its foreign subsidiaries, indicating a reduction in expected tax obligations on overseas earnings. In contrast, Walmart reported $3 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of January 31, 2022, for unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries that remain indefinitely reinvested and would incur withholding or other taxes upon repatriation. Both companies face exposure to foreign withholding taxes, but Colgate's restructuring allowed it to eliminate a portion of its liability, whereas Walmart continues to carry a significant deferred tax obligation, highlighting different strategies and outcomes in managing tax exposure from foreign subsidiaries.",

(1)\n\nThe impact of non-GAAP items on the Company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-GAAP adjustment on Income before income taxes and Provision for income taxes. (2)\n\nThe provision for income taxes for 2020 includes $71 of income tax benefits, of which $45 relates to previously recorded foreign withholding taxes and $26 relates to a previously recorded valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. As described more fully below, both items were previously recorded in connection with the charge recorded by the Company in 2017 and revised in 2018 related to the TCJA.\n\nAs part of the previously recorded charge for the TCJA, the Company had provided for foreign withholding taxes expected to be paid on the remittance of earnings from certain overseas subsidiaries no longer deemed indefinitely reinvested. As a result of a reorganization of the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries, the Company determined that no withholding taxes will be due on the remittance by certain subsidiaries of earnings previously deemed reinvested and, accordingly, reversed $45 of previously recorded foreign withholding taxes in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nAlso as part of the previously recorded charge for the TCJA, the Company provided a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset related to foreign tax credit carry-forwards that the Company did not expect to be able to use due to changes made by the TCJA. As a result of a new operating structure implemented within one of the Company's divisions, the Company believes the use of these foreign tax credit carry-forwards will not be limited in the future and, accordingly, reversed the previously recorded valuation allowance of $26 in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nThe effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the Company's global business initiatives.",

We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, suppliers sold them $545 and $639 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations. Amounts due to suppliers that participate in the SCF program may be reflected in cash flows from operating activities or cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The amounts settled through the SCF program were approximately $1.7 and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $3.1 billion of our total worldwide holdings of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business. Cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases, pension contributions and dividend payments to shareowners. All cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the U.S. without any U.S. federal income taxes. Any such distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and U.S. state taxes.

As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.  As of January 31, 2022, the Company has not recorded approximately $3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.\n\n## Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances\n\nAs of January 31, 2022, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $39.3 billion. Of these carryforwards, approximately $26.6 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2042. The remaining carryforwards have no expiration.\n\nThe recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the extent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe Company had valuation allowances of $9.5 billion and $8.8 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards. Activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2022 related to valuation allowance builds in multiple markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of underlying deferred tax assets.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nThe benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.\n\nAs of January 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:\n\n",

In contrast, CL reported that higher raw and packaging material costs reduced gross profit by 300 basis points in 2021, showing a more pronounced margin pressure despite offsetting pricing actions.

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (300 bps), partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (100 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (110 bps), partially offset by lower overhead expenses (80 bps). This decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to the portion of costs incurred in 2020 in connection with the voluntary recall of selected canned dog food products due to potentially elevated levels of Vitamin D resulting from a supplier error for which Hill's was not indemnified.",

In return for these services, the new joint venture is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our actual costs without markup. Subsequent to the transaction close date, the purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. We expect to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 billion in our PBNA and Europe segments in the first quarter of 2022 as a result of this transaction.\n\nWe have reclassified $1.8 billion of assets, primarily accounts receivable, net, and inventories of $0.5 billion, goodwill and other intangible assets of $0.6 billion and property, plant and equipment of",

The continuing evolution of the pandemic may also present risks not currently known to us.\n\n## Increased competition could hurt our business.\n\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. For additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, including the names of certain of our significant competitors, refer to the heading 'Competition' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of sales in the global market or in local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause the Company and our bottling partners to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers' ability to increase prices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost increases. Such pressures may also increase marketing costs along with in-store placement and slotting fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e-commerce may create additional consumer price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route-to-market strategies and thus negatively affect revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while we selectively expand into other profitable categories in the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.\n\n## If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.\n\nAchieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop, introduce and market new beverage products. The success of our innovation activities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends; obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines between, retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger retailers may seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system's profitability. In addition, in developed markets discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace, while in emerging and developing markets modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through ecommerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we and our bottling partners build e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail and foodservice customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\n\n## If we are unable to expand our operations in emerging and developing markets, our growth rate could be negatively affected.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Additionally, we rely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. Scarcity of, or heavy competition for, talented employee resources could impede our abilities in such markets. Moreover, the supply of our products in emerging and developing markets must match consumer demand for those products. Due to product price, limited purchasing power and cultural differences, our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or developing market.\n\n## If we do not successfully manage the possible negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement the most effective and efficient business model possible. Consequently, we continuously search for productivity opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take from time to time in pursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee morale which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and give rise to",

      "answer": "The depreciation of the Swiss Franc in 2023 contributed to MDLZ's after-tax gains or losses related to net investment hedges, which were recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income. This aligns with PEP_10k_2023 evidence that the Swiss Franc's depreciation was a key component of the currency translation adjustment. Meanwhile, TGT reported a currency translation adjustment and cash flow hedges of $(18) million for 2023, indicating a negative impact on its comprehensive income. Thus, the Swiss Franc's depreciation had a measurable effect on both companies' financials through the chain of influence.",

Higher net pricing, which included the carryov er impact of pricing actions taken in 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driv en pricing actions taken during 2024, was reflected across  all  regions.  T he  increase  in  input  costs  was  driv en  by  higher  raw  material  costs,  partially  offset  by  lower  manufacturing  costs  driv en  by productiv ity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs, as well as unfav orable year-ov er-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, grains, dairy and packaging costs.  Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix was due to v olume declines partially offset by fav orable product mix. Unfav orable v olume/mix was experienced in all regions.\n\nT otal selling, general and administrativ e expenses decreased $563 million from 2023, which was net of benefits from a number of factors noted in the table abov e, including in part, fav orable contingent consideration adjustments related to the Clif Bar acquisition and lower acquisition integration costs, lapping prior-year div estiture-related costs, the elimination of costs from the dev eloped market gum business div ested in 2023, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, a fav orable currency translation impact related to expenses and lapping prior-year impact from the European Commission legal matter, marginally offset by costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program and higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow  program.  Excluding  these  factors,  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses  increased  $215  million  from  2023.  T he  increase  was  driv en primarily  by  higher  adv ertising  and  consumer  promotion  costs  and  higher  ov erhead  costs  in  part  due  to  increased  inv estments  in  route  to  market capabilities.\n\nUnfavorable currency-related items, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, decreased operating income by $191 million primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to most currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Brazilian real, Egyptian pound, T urkish lira, Chinese yuan and Nigerian naira, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling and Polish zloty.\n\nOperating income margin increased from 15.3% in 2023 to 17.4% in 2024. The increase in operating income margin was driv en primarily by fav orable year-ov er-year  change  in  acquisition  integration  costs  and  contingent  consideration  adjustments,  fav orable  year-ov er-year  change  in  mark-to-market gains/(losses) from commodity and currency hedging activ ities, higher Adjusted Operating Income margin, lower div estiture-related costs, lapping prioryear impact from the European Commission legal matter and lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, partially offset by higher intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prior-year gain and the impact from the dev eloped market gum business div ested in 2023 and costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.9% in 2023 to 16.2% in 2024. The increase was driv en primarily by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driv en by productiv ity and ov erhead cost lev erage, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher adv ertising and consumer promotion costs.",

      "question": "What does the alignment of PM's postretirement healthcare trend rate reaching its ultimate rate in 2046 and PEP's salary projection leveling off in the same year suggest about the long-term cost stability for these companies' benefit obligations?",
      "answer": "The alignment of both PM and PEP reaching stabilized actuarial assumptions by 2046\u2014PM with its postretirement healthcare cost trend rate decreasing to 4.49% and PEP with salary projections leveling off at 4%\u2014suggests that both companies are modeling long-term cost stability for employee benefits starting in that year. For PM, this reflects a decrease in the healthcare cost trend from 6.54% in 2023 to an ultimate rate of 4.49% by 2046, indicating a gradual decline in the rate of increase for postretirement health care costs. For PEP, the leveling off of salary projections at 4% after showing a 5% average increase in 2024 suggests a controlled labor cost trajectory. This synchronized stabilization point may indicate similar long-term risk modeling or regulatory actuarial standards influencing both firms' liability forecasts.",

      "answer": "Colgate provides detailed sensitivity analysis showing that a 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation (PBO) by $475 million, while a decrease would increase it by $500 million. This demonstrates a proactive approach to quantifying discount rate risk. In contrast, Walmart's disclosures mention the remeasurement of Asda's pension benefit obligation but do not provide specific numerical relationships between discount rate changes and PBO fluctuations. Instead, Walmart notes that the remeasurement was part of broader restructuring activities, suggesting a less transparent or less analytically detailed treatment of pension obligations. The contrast highlights differing levels of granularity in how the two companies disclose and manage pension-related financial risks.",

MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes  to  Financial  Statements  (Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K).  This  section  generally  discusses  the  results  of operations for  2022  compared to 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition  for  2021  compared  to  2020  refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  our  fiscal  year  2021  Form  10-K,  which  was  filed  with  the  United  States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline,  pharmacy,  optical,  food  court,  hearing  aids,  and  tire  installation)  and  other  businesses  (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members  and  the  amount  they  spend  on  each  visit  (average  ticket).  Sales  comparisons  can  also  be  particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international  operations);  inflation  and  changes  in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions.  The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&amp;A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins  are  also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a  wide  range  of  global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or  reliably  predict  general  economic  health  or  changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term  on  maximizing  prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our members of our 'pricing authority' - consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlierthan-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost  increases  on  to  our  members.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  may  include  reducing  prices  on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).\n\nWe  believe  our  gasoline  business  enhances  traffic  in  our  warehouses,  but  it  generally  has  a  lower  gross  margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&amp;A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-",

(e)\n\nMerchandise sales - We record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store. Total revenues do not include sales tax because  we  are  a  pass-through  conduit  for  collecting  and  remitting  sales  taxes.  Generally,  guests  may  return  national  brand merchandise within 90 days of purchase and owned and exclusive brands within one year of purchase. Sales are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns and our expectation of future returns. As of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, the liability for estimated returns was $165 million and $139 million, respectively.\n\nWe routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Under the vast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record revenue and related costs gross. We concluded that we are the principal in these transactions for a number of reasons, most notably because we 1) control the overall economics of the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide goods to the customer. Merchandise received under these arrangements is not included in Inventory because the purchase and sale of this inventory are virtually simultaneous.\n\nRevenue from Target gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of issuance. Our gift cards  do  not  expire.  Based  on  historical  redemption  rates,  a  small  and  relatively  stable  percentage  of  gift  cards  will  never  be redeemed,  referred  to  as  \"breakage.\"  Estimated  breakage  revenue  is  recognized  over  time  in  proportion  to  actual  gift  card redemptions.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "Walmart's U.S. business reported a net sales growth of 4.8% in fiscal 2025, indicating steady but modest expansion. In contrast, Target\u2019s Beauty segment showed a more robust growth trajectory, increasing from $12,538 million in 2023 to $13,173 million in 2024, representing a 5.1% year-over-year increase. Procter & Gamble, a key supplier in the beauty space, reported 3% organic sales growth in its Beauty segment during fiscal 2024, suggesting a positive but moderate tailwind from market demand. Together, these figures indicate that while both retailers are experiencing growth in Beauty, Target is capitalizing more effectively on this category than Walmart, even as P&G's moderate organic growth implies a competitive but not rapidly expanding market environment.",

This difference in assumptions could lead to divergent financial planning approaches, with PEP likely recognizing lower projected pension asset growth, potentially requiring higher contributions or increased pension expense.

Meanwhile, CL specifically disclosed that the actuarial gains recorded in 2024 for their U.S. pension and Other retiree benefit plans were primarily due to increased discount rates, which decreased the benefit obligation. This reveals that while both companies experienced actuarial gains from higher discount rates, PEP anticipated a net increase in pension expense due to other offsetting factors (like fixed income losses), whereas CL directly tied the discount rate increase to lower obligations.

MDLZ, which sells products through various retail channels including Sam's Club (chunk1), would have exposure to both of these retail entities given Walmart's ownership of Sam's Club (chunk2).

This creates a strategic dilemma for Costco: while it must continue investing to remain competitive\u2014particularly in digital capabilities\u2014it must also manage costs carefully to avoid the same margin pressures Walmart anticipates.

      "answer": "In 2020, KO experienced an actuarial loss of $491 million for its primary U.S. pension plan due to a decrease in the discount rate. Similarly, CL also reported that a decrease in discount rates was the primary driver of actuarial losses during the same period. However, while KO specifically quantified its 2020 loss, CL did not provide a specific dollar amount but instead described the directional impact on benefit obligations. This reveals that both companies were exposed to similar pension valuation risks tied to discount rate fluctuations, but KO provided more granular disclosure around the financial impact compared to CL, which focused on the methodology and trend implications.",

        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Actuarial Loss: KO disclosed a specific actuarial loss of $491 million in 2020 due to a decrease in the discount rate.",

The actuarial losses incurred during 2020 were primarily driven by a decrease in discount rates applied against future expected benefit payments that resulted in an increase in the benefit obligation for both the U.S. pension and Other retiree benefit plans.\n\nThe overall investment objective of the plans is to balance risk and return so that obligations to employees are met. The Company evaluates its expected long-term rate of return on plan assets on an annual basis. In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rates of return. The assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets as of December 31, 2021 for the U.S. plans was 5.70%. Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 3%, 8%, 8%, 6% and 7%, respectively. Similar assessments were performed in determining rates of return on international pension plan assets to arrive at the Company's 2021 weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 2.72%.\n\nThe medical cost trend rate of increase assumed in measuring the expected cost of benefits is projected to decrease from 6.00% in 2022 to 4.75% by 2026, remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter.",

      "answer": "The difference in assumed rates of compensation increase\u20141.50% for MDLZ versus 1.77% for PM\u2014could lead to divergent long-term pension liability projections. MDLZ's lower assumption may result in slower growth in projected liabilities compared to PM, which assumes a higher rate. Given MDLZ's Non-U.S. Plan liability of $28 million for 2027-2031, a lower rate of compensation increase may reflect a more conservative actuarial approach or different regional workforce dynamics, potentially signaling lower long-term pension risk compared to PM's approach.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ \u2192 Non-U.S. Plans: MDLZ discloses $28 million in liabilities for Non-U.S. Plans from 2027-2031, indicating long-term pension obligations.",
        "Hop 2: Non-U.S. Plans \u2192 Rate of Compensation Increase: MDLZ assumes a 1.50% annual rate of compensation increase for Non-U.S. Plans, which directly affects the actuarial valuation of future pension liabilities.",
        "Hop 3: Rate of Compensation Increase \u2190 PM: PM assumes a higher rate of 1.77% for the rate of compensation increase in its pension plans as of 2021, suggesting a more aggressive growth assumption in future benefit payments."

      "answer": "MDLZ reported an expected rate of return on plan assets of 4.50% for U.S. plans in 2021, while CL disclosed a weighted average interest rate of 1.9% on notes in 2021. The significant difference of 2.6 percentage points suggests that MDLZ was projecting a more aggressive return assumption on its plan assets compared to the relatively conservative interest rate environment reflected in CL's debt obligations, indicating divergent strategies in managing long-term financial assets and liabilities.",

Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. Our net sales and gross profit margin are influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales.\n\nWe expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to inflationary trends; tariffs and trade restrictions; fluctuations in global currencies; swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; and supply chain pressures, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to \"Results of Operations\" below.\n\n## Company Performance Metrics\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows:\n\n- Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;\n- Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and\n- Returns - improve our Return on Investment through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend.\n\n## Growth\n\nOur objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club U.S. and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy.\n\nComparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We report on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.\n\nCalendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2025 and 2024, were as follows:\n\n",

We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") ex penses. Additionally, we focus on our mix  of businesses, including expanding our ecosystem in higher margin areas, such as digital advertising and marketplace. Our objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales.\n\n",

In contrast, PepsiCo experienced increased commodity costs in 2023 due to the inflationary environment, conflict in Ukraine, adverse weather, and supply chain disruptions, and it managed exposure through fixed-price contracts, purchase orders, and derivative instruments.

      "answer": "PM's long-term pension liabilities significantly decreased from $3,514 million in 2020 to $1,960 million in 2021, reflecting a reduction of $1,554 million. This indicates a material improvement in PM's pension liability position over that period. Meanwhile, PG identifies pension costs as a key input expense that must be managed through pricing actions, cost-saving initiatives, and sourcing decisions to maintain margins. PG's multi-year pension obligations, as shown in the intermediate evidence, remain substantial at $1,110 million in 2022 and projected at $5,385 million for 2027\u20132031. Therefore, while PM reduced its pension liability burden, PG continues to face significant pension-related cost pressures that directly influence its operational and financial planning.",

Inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results  depend,  in  part,  on  our  continued  ability  to  manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and  sourcing  decisions,  while  maintaining  and  improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of  operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how  well  we  can  compete  with  our  local  and  global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all  of  our  categories,  we  compete  against  a  wide  variety  of global  and  local  competitors.  As  a  result,  we  experience ongoing  competitive  pressures  in  the  environments  in  which we  operate,  which  may  result  in  challenges  in  maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be  able  to  successfully  respond  to  competitive  factors  and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives,  product  delivery  windows  and  trade  terms.  In addition,  evolving  sales  channels  and  business  models  may affect  customer  and  consumer  preferences  as  well  as  market dynamics,  which,  for  example,  may  be  seen  in  the  growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry  into  certain  categories  and  growth  in  hard  discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing  sales  channels  and  business  models,  particularly  ecommerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe  sell  most  of  our  products  via  retail  customers,  which include  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty  beauty  stores  (including  airport  duty-free  stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores  and professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot  reach  agreement  with  a  key  customer  on  trade  terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if  a  key  customer  were  to  significantly  reduce  the  inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased  offerings  of  other  branded  manufacturers,  private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons,  significantly  tighten  product  delivery  windows  or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If  the  reputation  of  the  Company  or  one  or  more  of  our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation  of  our  brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and  our  financial  success  directly  depends  on  the  success  of our  brands.  The  success  of  our  brands  can  suffer  if  our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also  be negatively  impacted  if  the  Company  or  one  of  our  brands suffers  substantial  harm  to  its  reputation  due  to  a  significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions  of  certain  ingredients,  negative  perceptions  of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleumbased materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices, privacy lapses or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.  Additionally,  negative  or  inaccurate  postings  or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage  the reputation of our brands or the Company.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  real  or perceived  issues,  including  concerns  about  safety,  quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the  Company  or  our products  could  be  negatively  impacted,  and  our  results  of operations  or  cash  flows  could  suffer.  Our  Company  also devotes  time  and  resources  to  citizenship  efforts  that  are consistent  with  our  corporate  values  and  are  designed  to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation,  including  programs  driving  ethics  and  corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental  sustainability.  While  the  Company  has  many programs and initiatives  to  further  these  goals,  our  ability  to achieve  these  goals  is  impacted  in  part  by  the  actions  and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers. If these programs  are  not  executed  as  planned  or  suffer  negative publicity,  the  Company's  reputation  and  results  of  operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nDue to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract  manufacturers,  distributors,  contractors,  commercial banks,  joint  venture  partners  and  external  business  partners, for  certain  functions.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash  flows  could  be  adversely  impacted.  Further,  failure  of these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola invested $4 million in capital expenditures in Latin America in 2024, while Procter & Gamble spent $3,322 million overall on capital spending in the same year. This significant disparity suggests that P&G may be prioritizing broader infrastructure or operational investments across its global footprint, whereas Coca-Cola\u2019s Latin American investment appears minimal, potentially signaling a more cautious or targeted approach in the region.",

      "answer": "PM disclosed a pension-related net loss of $4,147 million in 2022, which is a significant and specifically quantified exposure in their financial statements. In contrast, PG mentioned pension costs as part of broader input cost pressures, such as labor and energy, without quantifying pension exposure directly. This indicates that while PM explicitly reports a substantial pension loss, PG's pension exposure is embedded within a more generalized discussion of cost pressures, suggesting a less transparent or less acute financial risk in this area.",

Inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results  depend,  in  part,  on  our  continued  ability  to  manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and  sourcing  decisions,  while  maintaining  and  improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of  operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how  well  we  can  compete  with  our  local  and  global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all  of  our  categories,  we  compete  against  a  wide  variety  of global  and  local  competitors.  As  a  result,  we  experience ongoing  competitive  pressures  in  the  environments  in  which we  operate,  which  may  result  in  challenges  in  maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be  able  to  successfully  respond  to  competitive  factors  and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives,  product  delivery  windows  and  trade  terms.  In addition,  evolving  sales  channels  and  business  models  may affect  customer  and  consumer  preferences  as  well  as  market dynamics,  which,  for  example,  may  be  seen  in  the  growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry  into  certain  categories  and  growth  in  hard  discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing  sales  channels  and  business  models,  particularly  ecommerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe  sell  most  of  our  products  via  retail  customers,  which include  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty  beauty  stores  (including  airport  duty-free  stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores  and professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot  reach  agreement  with  a  key  customer  on  trade  terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if  a  key  customer  were  to  significantly  reduce  the  inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased  offerings  of  other  branded  manufacturers,  private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons,  significantly  tighten  product  delivery  windows  or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If  the  reputation  of  the  Company  or  one  or  more  of  our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation  of  our  brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and  our  financial  success  directly  depends  on  the  success  of our  brands.  The  success  of  our  brands  can  suffer  if  our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also  be negatively  impacted  if  the  Company  or  one  of  our  brands suffers  substantial  harm  to  its  reputation  due  to  a  significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions  of  certain  ingredients,  negative  perceptions  of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleumbased materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices, privacy lapses or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.  Additionally,  negative  or  inaccurate  postings  or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage  the reputation of our brands or the Company.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  real  or perceived  issues,  including  concerns  about  safety,  quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the  Company  or  our products  could  be  negatively  impacted,  and  our  results  of operations  or  cash  flows  could  suffer.  Our  Company  also devotes  time  and  resources  to  citizenship  efforts  that  are consistent  with  our  corporate  values  and  are  designed  to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation,  including  programs  driving  ethics  and  corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental  sustainability.  While  the  Company  has  many programs and initiatives  to  further  these  goals,  our  ability  to achieve  these  goals  is  impacted  in  part  by  the  actions  and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers. If these programs  are  not  executed  as  planned  or  suffer  negative publicity,  the  Company's  reputation  and  results  of  operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nDue to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract  manufacturers,  distributors,  contractors,  commercial banks,  joint  venture  partners  and  external  business  partners, for  certain  functions.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash  flows  could  be  adversely  impacted.  Further,  failure  of these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the",

      "answer": "Costco's 10-K filing shows the company prioritizes net sales growth as a core metric tied to its business model of high inventory turnover and low margins. For Procter & Gamble, this context helps frame how the company's 1% reported net sales growth in the Beauty segment (PG_10k_2023.pdf, page 32) was actually driven by a stronger 3% organic sales growth, with foreign exchange rates providing a 2% tailwind. However, despite this growth, P&G's Beauty segment net balance declined from $13,888 million in FY2023 to $13,723 million in FY2024, indicating potential pressures in converting sales growth into sustained balance sheet strength, possibly due to currency translation effects (-$104 million) and divestiture activities (-$61 million).",

      "question": "How did the use of Walmart U.S.'s distribution facilities by Sam's Club in fiscal 2022 impact its fulfillment efficiency compared to COST's standalone distribution model?",
      "answer": "Sam's Club leveraged Walmart U.S.'s distribution infrastructure in fiscal 2022, using 28 dedicated distribution facilities and shared access to Walmart's facilities to service its non-fuel purchases, which allowed for integrated logistics and potentially reduced overhead. COST, on the other hand, operates without shared infrastructure and relies entirely on its own distribution system. This difference in distribution models likely positioned Sam's Club to achieve greater fulfillment efficiency through cost-sharing and scale, while COST maintained full control but bore the full cost of its independent logistics network.",

          "chunk_text": "## Inventories\n\nThe Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is generally valued in most markets by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\").\n\n## Held for Sale\n\nComponents and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell.  The Company reviews its businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values. As of January 31, 2022, assets and liabilities held for sale were immaterial. As of January 31, 2021, $19.2 billion assets held for sale and $12.7 billion liabilities held for sale were classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively, reflecting the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan classified as held for sale which subsequently closed during fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 for additional details.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.\n\nCompetition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omnichannel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.\n\nDistribution. We utilize 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. During fiscal 2022, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were shipped directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 12 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.\n\nSam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\n\n## Suppliers and Supply Chain\n\nAs a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category. We offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" under the sub-caption \"Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks.\"\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Priorities\n\nOur ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-term value and create competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders, suppliers, business partners, and communities. We believe that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, including by enhancing customer and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing cost and risk, building capabilities for future advantage, and strengthening the underlying systems we all rely on.\n\nWe prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact. Our current ESG priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity, sustainability, community, and ethics and integrity.",

We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club. Many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products  are  high  quality,  offered  at  prices  that  are  generally  lower  than  national  brands,  and  help  lower  costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items.\n\nWe rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.\n\n## Available Information\n\nOur U.S. website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge,  our Annual  Reports  on  Form  10-K,  Quarterly  Reports  on  Form  10-Q,  Current  Reports  on  Form  8-K,  Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with or furnishing such documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains a site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.\n\nWe have a code of ethics for senior financial officers, pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Copies of the code are available free of charge by writing to Secretary, Costco Wholesale Corporation, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA 98027. If the Company makes any amendments to this code (other than technical, administrative, or non-substantive amendments) or grants any waivers, including implicit waivers, to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or principal accounting officer and controller, we will disclose (on our website or in a Form 8-K report filed with the SEC) the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date, and to whom it applies.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment reported **0% net sales growth**, driven by a **(2)% impact from volume and mix** and a **(2)% drag from foreign exchange**, despite a **3% price increase**. In contrast, Walmart's Total U.S. net sales grew by **4.9% in fiscal 2024**, with only a **(0.6)% impact from fuel pricing**, indicating strong underlying growth. This suggests that while Walmart is experiencing healthy top-line momentum, P&G's Baby, Feminine & Family Care business is underperforming in comparison, despite pricing actions, due to volume declines and FX pressures.",

        "Hop 1: PG \u2192 Baby, Feminine & Family Care: P&G reports Baby, Feminine & Family Care as one of its five reportable segments, which includes products like baby wipes, taped diapers, feminine hygiene, and family paper goods.",

        "Hop 3: Net Sales Growth \u2190 WMT: Walmart's Total U.S. business grew **4.9% in fiscal 2024**, with minimal fuel impact, indicating robust consumer demand and contrasting with P&G's stagnant growth in its family care segment."

This pricing flexibility is critical given that unfavorable economic conditions have negatively impacted and could further impact CL's business through reduced demand or downward pressure on selling prices (Hop1). In contrast, PEP faces market price exposure through its equity compensation programs, where the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is directly tied to the market price of PepsiCo\u2019s stock on the grant date (Hop3). While CL actively adjusts pricing to offset commodity cost volatility, PEP\u2019s exposure is structural and tied to stock performance, requiring different risk mitigation strategies such as performance thresholds and payout adjustments in PSUs. These approaches reflect fundamentally different financial risk profiles\u2014one operational and price-sensitive, the other equity-based and performance-linked.",

The increase in gross margin was due to:\n\n- a 220 basis-point increase from manufacturing productivity savings,\n- 160 basis points of lower commodity costs and\n- a 170 basis-point increase from higher pricing.\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\n- an 80 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix including the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand,\n- a 60 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,\n- 30 basis points of product and packaging investments and\n- 30 basis points of one-time manufacturing related costs including capacity startup costs.\n\nTotal SG&amp;A increased 10% to $23.3 billion due to increased marketing spending and overhead costs. SG &amp;A as a percentage of net sales increased 200 basis points to 27.7% due primarily to the increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales.\n\n- Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 170 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.\n- Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.\n\nProductivity-driven cost savings delivered 60 basis points of benefit to SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales.\n\nIn the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the G illette intangible asset. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the limited market portfolio restructuring program. For further discussion of the G illette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOperating margin was unchanged at 22.1% as the increase in gross margin was more than fully offset by the increase in SG &amp;A as a percentage of net sales and the non-cash impairment charge, as discussed above.\n\nOperating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, as discussed above.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n- Interest ex pense was $925 million, an increase of $169 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates.\n- Interest income was $473 million, an increase of $166 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates.\n- Other  non-operating  income  was  unchanged  at  $668  million  as  gains  from  the  sale  of  minor  brands  and  an  increase  in  net  non-operating  benefits  on postretirement plans were fully offset by a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.",

The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by unfavorable geographic mix impacts, partially offset by decreases due to higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation.\n\n## Net Earnings\n\nEarnings before income taxes increased $408 million, or 2%, to $18.8 billion due to the increase in operating income discussed above. Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in earnings before income tax es, partially offset by the increase in the effective income tax  rate discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.\n\nNet earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n\nDiluted EPS increased $0.12, or 2%, to $6.02 due primarily to the increase in net earnings.\n\n## SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation.

Meanwhile, PEP reports increasing pension liabilities from $216 million in 2021 to projected $1,110 million in 2022, signaling a significant financial obligation buildup. While PG actively manages pension costs as part of its cost structure, PEP faces a structural increase in pension liabilities that could constrain its financial flexibility more substantially over time compared to PG's more established cost management framework.",

Inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results  depend,  in  part,  on  our  continued  ability  to  manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and  sourcing  decisions,  while  maintaining  and  improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of  operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how  well  we  can  compete  with  our  local  and  global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all  of  our  categories,  we  compete  against  a  wide  variety  of global  and  local  competitors.  As  a  result,  we  experience ongoing  competitive  pressures  in  the  environments  in  which we  operate,  which  may  result  in  challenges  in  maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be  able  to  successfully  respond  to  competitive  factors  and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives,  product  delivery  windows  and  trade  terms.  In addition,  evolving  sales  channels  and  business  models  may affect  customer  and  consumer  preferences  as  well  as  market dynamics,  which,  for  example,  may  be  seen  in  the  growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry  into  certain  categories  and  growth  in  hard  discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing  sales  channels  and  business  models,  particularly  ecommerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe  sell  most  of  our  products  via  retail  customers,  which include  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty  beauty  stores  (including  airport  duty-free  stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores  and professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot  reach  agreement  with  a  key  customer  on  trade  terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if  a  key  customer  were  to  significantly  reduce  the  inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased  offerings  of  other  branded  manufacturers,  private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons,  significantly  tighten  product  delivery  windows  or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If  the  reputation  of  the  Company  or  one  or  more  of  our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation  of  our  brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and  our  financial  success  directly  depends  on  the  success  of our  brands.  The  success  of  our  brands  can  suffer  if  our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also  be negatively  impacted  if  the  Company  or  one  of  our  brands suffers  substantial  harm  to  its  reputation  due  to  a  significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions  of  certain  ingredients,  negative  perceptions  of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleumbased materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices, privacy lapses or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.  Additionally,  negative  or  inaccurate  postings  or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage  the reputation of our brands or the Company.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  real  or perceived  issues,  including  concerns  about  safety,  quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the  Company  or  our products  could  be  negatively  impacted,  and  our  results  of operations  or  cash  flows  could  suffer.  Our  Company  also devotes  time  and  resources  to  citizenship  efforts  that  are consistent  with  our  corporate  values  and  are  designed  to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation,  including  programs  driving  ethics  and  corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental  sustainability.  While  the  Company  has  many programs and initiatives  to  further  these  goals,  our  ability  to achieve  these  goals  is  impacted  in  part  by  the  actions  and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers. If these programs  are  not  executed  as  planned  or  suffer  negative publicity,  the  Company's  reputation  and  results  of  operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nDue to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract  manufacturers,  distributors,  contractors,  commercial banks,  joint  venture  partners  and  external  business  partners, for  certain  functions.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash  flows  could  be  adversely  impacted.  Further,  failure  of these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the",

The decision resulted in an increase in the obligations of the Retirement Plan, which based on the current funded status of the Retirement Plan and depending on further developments in the litigation, may require a cash contribution by the Company in 2025. In June 2023, we filed a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court requesting permission for an appeal to that court, which was denied in October 2023. Also, in June 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enter a revised final judgment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the 'District Court') to address certain unresolved calculation issues, which we opposed. In March 2024, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion and found for the plaintiffs on those calculation issues. We have appealed that decision to the Second Circuit. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we announced a voluntary recall of select Fabuloso multi-purpose cleaner products sold in the United States and Canada. The costs associated with the voluntary recall had a $25 impact on our Operating profit in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative'). All initiatives under the program have been implemented and the program concluded on December 31, 2024. The 2022 Global Productivity Initiative resulted in the reallocation of resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, efficiencies in our operations and the streamlining of our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Total pretax charges from the implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were $228 ($186 aftertax). Total annualized pretax  savings from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were approximately $125 ($100 aftertax). See 'Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges' below and Note 3, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred pretax costs of $85 (aftertax costs of $73) and $32 (aftertax costs of $25), respectively, resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative.\n\n## Outlook\n\nLooking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, including as a result of inflation, high interest rates, foreign currency volatility and developments in trade relations following the imposition of new and/or additional tariffs by the United States and other countries. We have taken and are taking additional pricing to try to offset the increases in raw and packaging material costs we have seen in recent years. This has negatively impacted consumer demand for our products. Additionally, inflation has impacted the broader economy with consumers around the world facing widespread rising prices as well as high interest rates resulting from measures to address inflation.\n\nRecent developments in trade relations and the imposition of new and/or additional tariffs by the United States and other countries, including following the United States' February 2025 executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, may contribute to inflationary pressures and, as a result, may impact consumer demand for our products. We are following the dynamic situation closely and evaluating the impact of such tariffs and any retaliatory actions taken by other countries on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we have made and will make efforts to mitigate the impact of these and any additional tariffs imposed by the United States and/or other countries, they could impact the cost and/or price of our products, the cost and availability of raw and packaging materials and commodities and/or consumer demand for our products due to, among other things, the impact of such tariffs on the global economy, inflationary pressures or geopolitical relations.\n\nSuch inflation and developments in trade relations as well as high interest rates may negatively impact consumer consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to 'private label' or to our lower-priced product offerings. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, these changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. In light of this challenging environment, we ex pect continued volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term.",

In contrast, Colgate-Palmolive experienced a $25 million negative impact on operating profit from a product recall in Q1 2023 and faced ongoing pressure from inflation, which affected consumer demand and pricing strategies.

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nlawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ('ERISA') seeking the recalculation of benefits and other relief associated with a 2005 residual annuity amendment to the Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees' Retirement Income Plan (the 'Retirement Plan'). The decision resulted in an increase in the obligations of the Retirement Plan, which based on the current funded status of the Retirement Plan and depending on further developments in the litigation, may require a cash contribution by the Company in 2025. In June 2023, we filed a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court requesting permission for an appeal to that court, which was denied in October 2023. Also, in June 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enter a revised final judgment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the 'District Court') to address certain unresolved calculation issues, which we opposed. In March 2024, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion and found for the plaintiffs on those calculation issues. We have appealed that decision to the Second Circuit. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we announced a voluntary recall of select Fabuloso multi-purpose cleaner products sold in the United States and Canada. The costs associated with the voluntary recall had a $25 impact on our Operating profit in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative'). All initiatives under the program have been implemented and the program concluded on December 31, 2024. The 2022 Global Productivity Initiative resulted in the reallocation of resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, efficiencies in our operations and the streamlining of our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Total pretax charges from the implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were $228 ($186 aftertax). Total annualized pretax  savings from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were approximately $125 ($100 aftertax). See 'Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges' below and Note 3, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred pretax costs of $85 (aftertax costs of $73) and $32 (aftertax costs of $25), respectively, resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative.\n\n## Outlook\n\nLooking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, including as a result of inflation, high interest rates, foreign currency volatility and developments in trade relations following the imposition of new and/or additional tariffs by the United States and other countries. We have taken and are taking additional pricing to try to offset the increases in raw and packaging material costs we have seen in recent years. This has negatively impacted consumer demand for our products. Additionally, inflation has impacted the broader economy with consumers around the world facing widespread rising prices as well as high interest rates resulting from measures to address inflation.\n\nRecent developments in trade relations and the imposition of new and/or additional tariffs by the United States and other countries, including following the United States' February 2025 executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, may contribute to inflationary pressures and, as a result, may impact consumer demand for our products. We are following the dynamic situation closely and evaluating the impact of such tariffs and any retaliatory actions taken by other countries on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we have made and will make efforts to mitigate the impact of these and any additional tariffs imposed by the United States and/or other countries, they could impact the cost and/or price of our products, the cost and availability of raw and packaging materials and commodities and/or consumer demand for our products due to, among other things, the impact of such tariffs on the global economy, inflationary pressures or geopolitical relations.\n\nSuch inflation and developments in trade relations as well as high interest rates may negatively impact consumer consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to 'private label' or to our lower-priced product offerings. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, these changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. In light of this challenging environment, we ex pect continued volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term.",

In contrast, MDLZ's $164 million contingent consideration adjustment cost in 2023 relates to the Clif Bar acquisition and reflects a strategic investment in expanding its global snack bar business. While both figures are identical in amount, PG's obligation is a recurring liability tied to workforce commitments, whereas MDLZ's expense stems from a one-time acquisition-related adjustment, signaling growth strategy rather than operational liability.",

('Ev irth'), a leading manufacturer of cakes and pastries in China. T he acquisition will continue to expand our growth in the cakes and pastries categories. The cash consideration paid for Ev irth totaled \u00a51.7 billion ($240 million), net of cash receiv ed.\n\nWe are working to complete the v aluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and hav e recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2024.\n\nWithin definite-liv ed intangible assets, we allocated $117 million to customer relationships which hav e an estimated useful life of 17 years. T he fair v alue of customer relationships at the acquisition date was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. The fair value measurements are based on significant unobserv able inputs, and thus represent Lev el 3 inputs. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair values of the intangible assets include discounted cash flows, customer attrition rates and discount rates.\n\nGoodwill of $122 million was determined as the excess of the purchase price ov er the fair v alue of the net assets acquired and arises principally as a result of expansion opportunities and synergies across China. None of the goodwill recognized will be deductible for income tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to the AMEA operating segment. For further detail, refer to Note 6. Goodw ill and Intangible Assets.\n\nWe incurred acquisition integration and contingent consideration adjustment costs of $8 million, acquisition-related costs of $3 million and an inv entory step-up charge of $3 million in 2024.\n\n## Ricolino\n\nOn November 1, 2022, we acquired 100% of the equity of Grupo Bimbo's confectionery business, Ricolino, located primarily in Mexico. The acquisition of Ricolino builds on our continued prioritization of fast-growing snacking segments in key geographies. The cash consideration paid for Ricolino totaled 26 billion Mexican pesos ($1.3 billion), net of cash receiv ed.\n\nWe incurred acquisition integration costs of $21 million in 2024, $50 million in 2023 and $11 million in 2022. In 2022, we also incurred an inv entory stepup charge of $5 million and recorded sev eral items within acquisition-related costs that resulted in income of $64 million as realized gains related to hedging contracts associated with acquisition funds more than offset other acquisition transaction costs.\n\n## Clif Bar\n\nOn August 1, 2022, we acquired 100% of the equity of Clif Bar &amp; Company ('Clif Bar'), a leading U.S. maker of nutritious energy bars with organic ingredients. T he acquisition expands our global snack bar business and complements our refrigerated snacking and performance nutrition bar portfolios. The total cash payment of $2.9 billion includes purchase price consideration of $2.6 billion, net of cash receiv ed, and one-time compensation expense of $0.3 billion  related  to  the  buyout  of  the  non-v ested  employee  stock  ownership  plan  (\"ESOP\")  shares.  T his  compensation  expense  is  considered  an acquisition-related cost. We also incurred a contingent consideration liability with an acquisition date fair v alue of $440 million.\n\nWe recorded  a  net  gain  in  acquisition  integration  costs  and  contingent  consideration  adjustments  of  $393  million  in  2024  and  incurred  acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments of $164 million in 2023 and $30 million in 2022. Refer to Note 10, Financial Instruments for additional information on the changes to the contingent consideration liability. We also incurred acquisition-related costs of $296 million, primarily related to the buyout of the non-v ested ESOP shares, and an inv entory step-up charge of $20 million in 2022.\n\n## Chipita\n\nOn January 3, 2022, we acquired 100% of the equity of Chipita Global S.A. ('Chipita'), a leading croissants and baked snacks company in the Central and Eastern European markets. The acquisition of Chipita offers a strategic complement to our existing portfolio and adv ances our strategy to become the global leader in broader snacking. T he cash consideration paid for Chipita totaled \u20ac1.2 billion ($1.4 billion), net of cash receiv ed, plus the assumption of Chipita's debt of \u20ac0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) for a total purchase price of \u20ac1.7 billion ($1.8 billion).",

      "answer": "Colgate's 2024 European organic sales growth was 6.7%, indicating strong demand in the personal and home care segment in that region. In contrast, Sam's Club U.S. reported a net sales growth of 2.3% in fiscal 2024, which was further reduced by a 2.6% negative fuel impact. This suggests that while premium consumer goods in Europe experienced robust growth, the warehouse retail segment in the U.S. faced more subdued demand or greater competitive or pricing pressures during the same period.",

The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives.

In comparison, Mondelez reported that higher raw material costs negatively impacted its overall segment operating income, although the Europe segment benefited from favorable currency (3.7 percentage points) and volume/mix (3.6 percentage points). The Europe segment specifically saw increased demand in chocolate, biscuits, cheese & grocery, and refreshment beverages, which helped offset raw material pressures. Hill's employed pricing actions and cost savings from funding-the-growth initiatives, while Mondelez leveraged productivity programs and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs to mitigate the impact of rising raw material expenses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CL \u2192 Higher Raw Material Costs: Hill's Pet Nutrition experienced a 300 bps negative impact on gross profit due to higher raw and packaging material costs in 2021.",

Organic sales in Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 13.5% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by the United States and Europe.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was due to organic sales growth in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.\n\nOperating profit in Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 14% in 2021 to $901, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 30 bps to 27.2%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (40 bps) and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (300 bps), partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (100 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (110 bps), partially offset by lower overhead expenses (80 bps). This decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to the portion of costs incurred in 2020 in connection with the voluntary recall of selected canned dog food products due to potentially elevated levels of Vitamin D resulting from a supplier error for which Hill's was not indemnified.",

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.

A higher credit rating like KO's 'A+' typically indicates stronger creditworthiness, which can lead to lower borrowing costs. KO's debt financing strategy, which includes $6,891 million in debt issuances during 2023, leverages its strong capital position to access global financial markets at a low effective cost. In contrast, PM's lower rating of 'A-' may expose it to relatively higher interest expenses, despite its own prudent debt management practices. Therefore, KO's superior rating likely provides it with a more favorable cost of borrowing compared to PM.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Fabric & Home Care segment reported earnings before income taxes of $6,303 million in 2023, representing a margin of approximately 22.2% (based on net sales of $28,371 million). In comparison, Philip Morris reported total earnings before income taxes of $8,353 million for the same period. This suggests that PG's Fabric & Home Care segment alone contributes significantly to PG\u2019s overall profitability and compares favorably with PM\u2019s total pre-tax earnings, indicating strong segment-level performance.",

      "question": "How does the change in pension liabilities from PEP in 2021 to 2022 compare with the amortization of pension-related net losses for PM in 2022, given the multi-year pension obligations disclosed by PEP?",
      "answer": "PEP reported pension liabilities of $216 million in 2021 and none in 2022, indicating a decrease. Meanwhile, PM amortized $294 million of pension-related net losses in 2022. PEP's multi-year pension obligations show a projected $1,110 million pension liability in 2022, which contrasts with the drop in reported liabilities, suggesting a potential reclassification or change in valuation methodology. This comparison highlights differing pension liability management approaches between the two companies in the same reporting year.",

        "Hop 1: PEP \u2192 Pension Liabilities: PEP disclosed $216 million in pension liabilities in 2021 and none in 2022, indicating a significant year-over-year change.",

        "Hop 3: Pension \u2190 PM: PM amortized $294 million of pension-related net losses in 2022, reflecting active pension expense recognition in contrast to PEP\u2019s reduction in reported liabilities."

PMI subsequently sold SMDL on June 30, 2023 and the transaction did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe  unaudited  pro  forma  combined  financial  information  was  prepared  using  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting  and  was  based  on  the  historical  financial information of PMI and Swedish Match. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2021, as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the following:\n\n- incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the current fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired;\n- incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory;\n- additional interest ex pense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition, including the effects of the related derivative financial instruments designated to hedge interest rate risks as well as economic hedges;\n- reclassification of non-recurring acquisition-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, to the year ended December 31, 2021;\n- impact of a deferred tax cost of $430 million in 2022 and $321 million in 2021 related to the theoretical unrealized foreign currency gains on intercompany loans related  to  the  acquisition  financing.  These  theoretical  unrealized  pre-tax   foreign  currency  movements  were  fully  offset  in  the  consolidated  statements  of earnings and were reflected as currency translation adjustments in",

      "question": "How does the negative impact of product mix on Costco's net sales growth projections compare to Procter & Gamble's reported mix effects across its business segments in FY2023?",
      "answer": "Costco's forward-looking statements highlight that net sales growth projections are sensitive to product mix changes, as their business model emphasizes inventory efficiency through high-volume sales of a limited product selection. In contrast, Procter & Gamble reported mixed effects from product mix in FY2023: while the Health Care segment saw a positive 2% impact and Fabric & Home Care added 1%, the Beauty segment experienced a negative 1% effect. This reveals differing sensitivities to product mix between the two companies' financial outcomes.",

MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes  to  Financial  Statements  (Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K).  This  section  generally  discusses  the  results  of operations for  2022  compared to 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition  for  2021  compared  to  2020  refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  our  fiscal  year  2021  Form  10-K,  which  was  filed  with  the  United  States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline,  pharmacy,  optical,  food  court,  hearing  aids,  and  tire  installation)  and  other  businesses  (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members  and  the  amount  they  spend  on  each  visit  (average  ticket).  Sales  comparisons  can  also  be  particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international  operations);  inflation  and  changes  in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions.  The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&amp;A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins  are  also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a  wide  range  of  global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or  reliably  predict  general  economic  health  or  changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term  on  maximizing  prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our members of our 'pricing authority' - consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlierthan-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost  increases  on  to  our  members.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  may  include  reducing  prices  on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).\n\nWe  believe  our  gasoline  business  enhances  traffic  in  our  warehouses,  but  it  generally  has  a  lower  gross  margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&amp;A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-",

These favorable impacts to operating income/(loss) were partially offset by higher commodity costs, including the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges, higher supply chain costs, reflecting inflationary pressure in manufacturing and procurement costs, unfavorable volume/mix, increased SG&amp;A primarily for advertising expenses, and the decrease from lapping a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period.\n\nNet income/(loss) increased 20.2% to $2.8 billion in 2023 compared to $2.4 billion in 2022. This increase was driven by the operating income/(loss) factors discussed above and lower interest expense, which more than offset unfavorable changes in other expense/(income) and higher tax expense.\n\n- Interest ex pense was $912 million in 2023 compared to $921 million in 2022.\n- Our effective tax rate was 21.7% in 2023 compared to 20.2% in 2022. The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to the merger of certain foreign entities and the revaluation of deferred tax  balances due to changes in state tax  laws in the prior year versus the current year.\n- Other expense/(income) was $27 million of expense in 2023 compared to $253 million of income in 2022. This change was primarily driven by $202 million of unfavorable changes in net pension and postretirement non-service cost/(benefit) due, in part, to the settlement of one of our U.K. defined benefit pension plans,  which  resulted  in  pre-tax   losses  of  $162  million  in  2023.  Further,  additional  changes  in  other  ex pense/(income)  were  driven  by  $179  million  of unfavorable  changes  in  foreign  ex change  losses/(gains).  These  unfavorable  impacts  to  other  ex pense/(income)  were  partially  offset  by  $109  million  of favorable changes in derivative losses/(gains).\n\nAdjusted Operating Income increased 6.2% to $5.3 billion in 2023 compared to $5.0 billion in 2022, primarily due to higher pricing and the beneficial impact from our efficiency initiatives, which more than offset higher commodity costs, including the impact of realized gains and losses on commodity hedges; higher supply chain costs, reflecting inflationary pressure in manufacturing, procurement, and logistics; unfavorable volume/mix; increased SG &amp;A, primarily advertising expenses; the decrease from lapping a 53rd week of shipments in the prior period (2.2 pp); and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (1.2 pp).\n\n## Diluted Earnings Per Share ('EPS'):\n\n",

During 2024, we experienced  sales  impacts  related  to  this  conflict  in  certain  AMEA  markets,  but  this  did  not  hav e  a  material  impact  on  our  business,  results  of operations or financial condition. We continue to ev aluate the impacts of these dev elopments on our business and we cannot predict if it will hav e a significant impact in the future.\n\n## ERP System Implementation\n\nIn  July  2024, our  Board of  Directors approv ed funding of $1.2 billion for a multi-year systems transformation program to upgrade our global ERP and supply  chain  systems  (the  'ERP  System  Implementation').  The  ERP  System  Implementation  spending  comprises  both  capital  expenditures  and operating  expenses,  of  which  a  majority  is  expected  to  relate  to  operating  expenses.

Refer  to Non-GAAP  financial  measures and  Note  1, Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies for additional information.\n\n## Extreme Price Growth in Argentina\n\nDuring December 2023, the Argentinean peso significantly dev alued. The peso's dev aluation and potential resulting distortion on our non-GAAP Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other constant currency growth rate measures resulted in our decision to exclude the impact of pricing increases  in  excess  of  26%  year-ov er-year  (\"extreme  pricing\")  in  Argentina,  from  these  measures  beginning  in  Q1  2024.  T he  benchmark  of  26% represents the minimum annual inflation rate for each year ov er a 3-year period which would result in a cumulativ e inflation rate in excess of 100%, the lev el  at  which  an  economy  is  considered  hyperinflationary  under  U.S.  GAAP.  T hroughout  the  following  MD&amp;A  discussion,  we  now  exclude,  on  a prospectiv e basis beginning on January 1, 2024, the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from the net pricing impact of Organic Net Rev enue and Organic Net Revenue growth and its related impact on our other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding offset to changes in currency translation rates. Additionally within the MD&amp;A discussion, \"currency-related items\" totals the impact of extreme pricing and the currency translation rate changes. Refer to Non-GAAP financial measures for additional information.\n\nCurrency-related items impacted our non-GAAP financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2024 as follows:\n\n- Organic Net Revenue: In total, unfav orable currency-related items of $710 million (2.0 pp) were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $1,877 million (5.2 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (3.2 pp).  In  Emerging  Markets, unfav orable currencyrelated items of $778 million (5.6 pp) were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $1,945 million (13.9 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (8.3 pp). In Dev eloped Markets, fav orable currency-related items of $68 million (0.3 pp) were driv en by fav orable currency translation rate changes.\n- Adjusted Operating Income: Unfav orable currency-related items of $191 million were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $460 million, partially offset by extreme pricing of $269 million.\n- Adjusted EPS: Unfavorable currency-related items of $0.12 were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $0.32, partially offset by extreme pricing of $0.20.",

In contrast, Procter & Gamble reported a total company net sales growth of 2% in 2024, driven primarily by a 4% price increase across its product lines, despite volume declines in key categories like Baby, Feminine & Family Care.

Our net sales and gross profit margin are influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales.\n\nWe expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to inflationary trends; tariffs and trade restrictions; fluctuations in global currencies; swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; and supply chain pressures, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to \"Results of Operations\" below.\n\n## Company Performance Metrics\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows:\n\n- Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;\n- Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and\n- Returns - improve our Return on Investment through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend.\n\n## Growth\n\nOur objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club U.S. and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy.\n\nComparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We report on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.\n\nCalendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2025 and 2024, were as follows:\n\n",

For PM, the amortization of Prior Service Cost (Credit) was $4 million, which slightly offset their overall benefit costs. This reveals that MO benefits more significantly from prior service credits in reducing current expenses compared to PM, suggesting differing strategies or historical benefit changes between the two companies.",

In contrast, PM experienced derivative-related net revenue volatility of $59 million in 2021, indicating exposure to market fluctuations that could offset pricing gains seen by companies like MDLZ.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ \u2192 Higher Net Pricing: MDLZ reported that higher net pricing contributed $678 million to operating income in 2021 and drove 2.0 percentage points of net revenue growth.",

Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola's 2022 strategy to increase net revenues through bottling operations focused on acquiring or divesting bottling assets to optimize performance, aiming to increase unit case volume, net revenues, and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generated increased sales for Coca-Cola's concentrate operations. This operational strategy contrasts with Mondel\u0113z's approach in 2022, where higher net pricing contributed $495 million to adjusted operating income, despite facing higher input costs of $394 million. In 2021, Mondel\u0113z reported a $949 million net revenue increase, of which higher net pricing accounted for 1.4 percentage points. While Coca-Cola leveraged operational control and equity investments in bottlers to drive revenue growth, Mondel\u0113z strategically used pricing as a lever to boost revenues, demonstrating two distinct approaches to revenue growth, with Coca-Cola focusing on structural optimization and Mondel\u0113z emphasizing pricing power.",

          "chunk_text": "## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage segment in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has authorized alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our brands on alcohol beverages. Competitive products include all flavored alcohol beverages of varying alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Unilever, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     instore displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.\n\nOur competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated employees. Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many countries, a concentrated retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers' own store or private-label beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural resource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we operate, as one of the key challenges facing our business.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $949 million (9.3%), due to favorable currency (3.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp), higher net pricing (1.4 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.",

Organic sales in Latin America increased 16.8% in 2024. Organic sales growth was led by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2024 versus 2023 was due to increases in Oral Care, Home Care and Personal Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the surface cleaner and hand dish categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the underarm protection category.\n\nOperating profit in Latin America increased 8% in 2024 to $1,526, or 140 bps to 31.9% as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (220 bps), partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative ex penses (100 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in G ross profit was due to higher pricing and cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (290 bps), partially offset by significantly higher raw and packaging material costs (540 bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs.

      "answer": "MDLZ sells its snack products to Sam's Club, a major retail channel. Sam's Club reported a 14.6% increase in comparable sales for fiscal 2023, driven by growth in transactions, particularly in grocery categories. As CL processes transactions including those from retailers like Sam's Club, it faces increased exposure to cybersecurity risks. CL acknowledges in its 10-K that higher transaction volumes strain its IT/OT systems and increase the likelihood of cyberattacks, including ransomware, phishing, and unauthorized access attempts. CL also notes that while it has security measures in place, evolving threats and system upgrades may leave it vulnerable to breaches that could disrupt operations, damage reputation, and result in financial losses.",

In contrast, PEP recognized a prior service cost/(credit) of $1 million (as part of a broader pension strategy) and explicitly outlined amortization approaches tied to participant demographics, such as the average remaining service life (11 years) for Plan H and life expectancy (26 years) for Plan I. These differences in recognition and amortization timing could lead to varying financial statement impacts, with PEP's structured amortization approach potentially creating more predictable expenses over time, while PM's smaller prior service cost may reflect a less significant near-term impact on earnings.",

The settlem ent charge was triggered when the aggregate of the cum ulative lum p sum  distributions and the annuity contract prem ium  exceeded the total annual service and interest cost.\n\nEffective December 31, 2022, we merged two U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, PepsiCo Em ployees Retirem ent Plan I (Plan I), m ostly i n acti v e parti ci pan ts, an d PepsiCo Em pl oyees Reti rem ent Pl an A, m ostly active participants, with Plan I rem aining. The accrued benefits offered to the  plans'  partici pants  were  unchanged.  The  m erger  was  m ade  to  provide  additional  flexibility  in  evaluating  opportunities  to  reduce  risk  and volatili ty .

There was no material im pact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from  this m erger.\n\nIn 2022, we transferred pension and retiree m edical obligations of $145 m illion and related assets to TBG in connection with the Juice Transaction. See Note 13 for further inform ation.\n\nIn  2020,  we  adopted  an  am endm ent  to  the  U.S.  qualified  defined  benefit  plans  to  freeze  benefit  accruals  for  salaried  participants,  effective December 31, 2025.\n\nGains and losses resulting from  actual experience differing from  our assum ptions, including the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assum ptions, are determ ined at each m easurem ent date. These differences are recognized as a com ponent of net gain or loss in accum ulated other com prehensive loss within com m on shareholders' equity . If this net accum ulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the m arket-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/incom e for the following year based upon the average rem aining service life for participants in PepsiCo Em ployees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H) (approxim ately  11 years) and retiree m edical (approxim ately 11 years), and the rem aining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approxim ately 26 years).\n\nThe cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior em ployee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree m edical benefits (expense)/incom e on a straight-line basis over the average rem aining service life for participants in Plan H, and the rem aining life expectancy for participants in Plan I, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the benefit accruals freeze effective Decem ber 31, 2025 is am ortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze.",

This spending is part of PepsiCo's broader capital allocation, with FLNA representing a significant portion of its total capital spending of $5,318 million in 2024. In comparison, Procter & Gamble reported $3,322 million in total capital spending for the same year, which supports its diversified portfolio of consumer goods across beauty, grooming, and household products. The difference in scale and focus between the two companies' capital investments highlights PepsiCo's emphasis on snack manufacturing capacity and P&G\u2019s broader investment across multiple consumer sectors.",

        "Hop 1: PEP \u2192 FLNA: PepsiCo discloses that its Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segment spent $1,182 million on capital expenditures in 2024, indicating a strong investment in snack food production infrastructure.",

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.",

These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n## Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nNote 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Altria's consolidated financial statements. In most instances, Altria must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under GAAP.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in Altria's consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between Altria's estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of Altria's consolidated financial statements:\n\n- Revenue Recognition: Altria's businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. Net revenues are defined as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. Altria's businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\n\nAltria's businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. Expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nFor further discussion, see Note 3. Revenues from Contracts with Customers to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n\n- Depreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation: Altria depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes its definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\n\nAltria reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. These analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If Altria determines that an impairment exists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. Altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\n\nAltria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require Altria to perform an interim review. Altria has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, Altria will perform a single step quantitative impairment test. Additionally, Altria has the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit, but is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value in the period identified.",

      "answer": "PEP reported pension liabilities of $216 million in 2021 and projects pension funding requirements of $1,110 million in 2022, declining to $960 million in 2023 and 2024, before gradually increasing to $1,030 million in 2026 and totaling $5,385 million from 2027\u20132031. PG, while not disclosing direct pension liabilities, highlights pension and healthcare costs as key components of its operating expenses that require active management through pricing actions, cost-saving initiatives, and sourcing decisions to maintain margins. This indicates that while PEP faces quantifiable pension obligations with a defined multi-year payout schedule, PG experiences indirect pension-related cost pressures embedded in its broader operating cost structure, requiring different risk mitigation strategies despite both companies being exposed to pension-related financial risks.",

Failure to manage these fluctuations  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of  operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how  well  we  can  compete  with  our  local  and  global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all  of  our  categories,  we  compete  against  a  wide  variety  of global  and  local  competitors.  As  a  result,  we  experience ongoing  competitive  pressures  in  the  environments  in  which we  operate,  which  may  result  in  challenges  in  maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be  able  to  successfully  respond  to  competitive  factors  and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives,  product  delivery  windows  and  trade  terms.  In addition,  evolving  sales  channels  and  business  models  may affect  customer  and  consumer  preferences  as  well  as  market dynamics,  which,  for  example,  may  be  seen  in  the  growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry  into  certain  categories  and  growth  in  hard  discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing  sales  channels  and  business  models,  particularly  ecommerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe  sell  most  of  our  products  via  retail  customers,  which include  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty  beauty  stores  (including  airport  duty-free  stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores  and professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot  reach  agreement  with  a  key  customer  on  trade  terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if  a  key  customer  were  to  significantly  reduce  the  inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased  offerings  of  other  branded  manufacturers,  private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons,  significantly  tighten  product  delivery  windows  or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If  the  reputation  of  the  Company  or  one  or  more  of  our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation  of  our  brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and  our  financial  success  directly  depends  on  the  success  of our  brands.  The  success  of  our  brands  can  suffer  if  our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also  be negatively  impacted  if  the  Company  or  one  of  our  brands suffers  substantial  harm  to  its  reputation  due  to  a  significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions  of  certain  ingredients,  negative  perceptions  of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleumbased materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices, privacy lapses or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.  Additionally,  negative  or  inaccurate  postings  or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage  the reputation of our brands or the Company.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  real  or perceived  issues,  including  concerns  about  safety,  quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the  Company  or  our products  could  be  negatively  impacted,  and  our  results  of operations  or  cash  flows  could  suffer.  Our  Company  also devotes  time  and  resources  to  citizenship  efforts  that  are consistent  with  our  corporate  values  and  are  designed  to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation,  including  programs  driving  ethics  and  corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental  sustainability.  While  the  Company  has  many programs and initiatives  to  further  these  goals,  our  ability  to achieve  these  goals  is  impacted  in  part  by  the  actions  and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers. If these programs  are  not  executed  as  planned  or  suffer  negative publicity,  the  Company's  reputation  and  results  of  operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nDue to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract  manufacturers,  distributors,  contractors,  commercial banks,  joint  venture  partners  and  external  business  partners, for  certain  functions.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash  flows  could  be  adversely  impacted.  Further,  failure  of these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the",

      "answer": "PEP reported pension liabilities of $216 million in 2021 and $0 in 2022, indicating a significant reduction or reclassification of pension obligations. This aligns with PEP's multi-year pension obligation schedule, which shows a $1,110 million liability for 2022, suggesting long-term pension commitments remain despite the drop in the short-term liability. In contrast, MO had $159 million in pension amortization of net loss and $6 million in prior service cost in 2022, indicating active pension cost reclassification impacting its financials. This reveals differing pension liability dynamics: PEP reduced short-term reported liabilities while maintaining long-term obligations, whereas MO is actively amortizing pension-related costs.",

In contrast, Altria experienced a $13 million net (loss) gain related to post-employment benefits, indicating a much smaller exposure or different valuation dynamics.

The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Refer to Note 8 for more information.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option, are measured on a recurring basis (generally using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy) and recognized within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

      "answer": "MO experienced a $19 million impact from post-employment benefits on net losses in 2022, while PM reported a significantly larger impact of $775 million. This stark contrast suggests that PM faces substantially greater pension-related financial pressure, which could constrain its ability to fund growth initiatives, acquisitions, or R&D compared to MO. MO\u2019s relatively smaller obligation could provide it with greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities without the same level of pension burden.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO \u2192 Post-Employment Benefits: MO's 2022 financial data shows a $19 million impact from post-employment benefits on net losses, indicating a moderate level of pension-related financial exposure.",
        "Hop 2: Post-Employment Benefits \u2192 Net Losses: Both companies disclose how post-employment benefits contribute to net losses, with PM\u2019s losses being significantly higher, at $775 million, compared to MO\u2019s $19 million, highlighting a major disparity in pension liabilities.",
        "Hop 3: Net Losses \u2190 PM: PM\u2019s 2022 financials reveal that post-employment benefits contributed $775 million to net losses, which is a much larger financial drag and could limit PM\u2019s capacity to invest in strategic priorities relative to MO."

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported capital spending of $3,156 million in 2022, while Coca-Cola invested only $2 million in capital expenditures in Latin America during the same period. This stark contrast suggests that while P&G was making significant overall capital investments, Coca-Cola was largely deprioritizing capital investment in Latin America, potentially signaling different strategic focuses or market maturity assessments in the region.",

      "answer": "AMT recorded a $1.2 billion loss on sale specifically from exiting its India market through the ATC TIPL transaction, primarily driven by the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments. In contrast, PEP reported $71 million in loss on sale and impairment charges related to non-strategic brand exits across its LatAm segment. While AMT's loss reflects a major market exit impacting its core international portfolio, PEP's charge indicates more targeted brand-level restructuring. This reveals differing scales of portfolio transformation, with AMT undertaking a complete market exit versus PEP's selective brand divestitures.",

T he fair v alue of customer relationships at the acquisition date was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. The fair value measurements are based on significant unobserv able inputs, and thus represent Lev el 3 inputs. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair values of the intangible assets include discounted cash flows, customer attrition rates and discount rates.\n\nGoodwill of $122 million was determined as the excess of the purchase price ov er the fair v alue of the net assets acquired and arises principally as a result of expansion opportunities and synergies across China. None of the goodwill recognized will be deductible for income tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to the AMEA operating segment. For further detail, refer to Note 6. Goodw ill and Intangible Assets.\n\nWe incurred acquisition integration and contingent consideration adjustment costs of $8 million, acquisition-related costs of $3 million and an inv entory step-up charge of $3 million in 2024.\n\n## Ricolino\n\nOn November 1, 2022, we acquired 100% of the equity of Grupo Bimbo's confectionery business, Ricolino, located primarily in Mexico.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nIn 2023, the Company undertook a strategic review of its India operations, where the Company evaluated the appropriate level of exposure to the India market within its global portfolio of communications assets, and assessed opportunities to repurpose capital to drive long-term shareholder value and sustained growth. The strategic review concluded in January 2024 with the signed agreement for the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined below).\n\nOn January 4, 2024, the Company, through ATC TIPL, entered into an agreement with Data Infrastructure Trust ('DIT'), an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management, pursuant to which DIT agreed to acquire a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL (the 'ATC TIPL Transaction').

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's capital spending increased from $3,062 million in 2023 to $3,322 million in 2024, a rise of $260 million. In contrast, PepsiCo's capital spending in the AMESA segment grew from $391 million in 2023 to $450 million in 2024, an increase of $59 million. While both companies increased capital allocation to AMESA, P&G's overall capital spending is significantly higher, suggesting a broader investment strategy, whereas PepsiCo's focus in AMESA may reflect targeted growth in specific emerging markets.",

      "answer": "Philip Morris experienced a 1.8% decrease in total shipment volume in South & Southeast Asia in 2022, driven by significant declines in the Philippines (-17.6%) and Thailand, despite growth in India (+13.6%) and Indonesia (+7.2%). This unfavorable volume/mix negatively impacted their net revenues. In contrast, Mondel\u0113z reported a $725 million (12.6%) increase in net revenues, with favorable volume/mix contributing 5.3 percentage points, driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum, and candy across the region. This divergence highlights contrasting regional dynamics: while PM struggled with market share losses and regulatory impacts in the Philippines, MDLZ benefited from recovery in consumer demand post-pandemic and successful execution in key snack categories.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM \u2192 Unfavorable Volume/Mix: PM's total shipment volume in South & Southeast Asia decreased by 1.8% in 2022, primarily due to a 17.6% drop in the Philippines and a 4.7% drop in Thailand, despite growth in India (+13.6%) and Indonesia (+7.2%).",
        "Hop 2: Unfavorable Volume/Mix \u2192 Net Revenues: Volume/mix directly impacts net revenues, as seen in MDLZ's 2021 performance where favorable volume/mix contributed 5.3 percentage points to a $725 million (12.6%) increase in net revenues.",
        "Hop 3: Net Revenues \u2190 MDLZ: MDLZ's 2022 context shows that favorable volume/mix in chocolate, biscuits, gum, and candy drove significant revenue growth, contrasting with PM's unfavorable volume/mix challenges in tobacco."

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

In contrast, KO disclosed derivative-related earnings impacts but did not quantify the total net effect of foreign exchange on its earnings. PG's significant negative impact suggests limited hedging effectiveness or exposure to volatile currencies, while KO's use of derivatives indicates an active currency risk management approach, though the lack of a specific net impact figure prevents a definitive comparison of the effectiveness of their strategies.",

The increase in gross margin was due to:\n\n- a 220 basis-point increase from manufacturing productivity savings,\n- 160 basis points of lower commodity costs and\n- a 170 basis-point increase from higher pricing.\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\n- an 80 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix including the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand,\n- a 60 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,\n- 30 basis points of product and packaging investments and\n- 30 basis points of one-time manufacturing related costs including capacity startup costs.\n\nTotal SG&amp;A increased 10% to $23.3 billion due to increased marketing spending and overhead costs. SG &amp;A as a percentage of net sales increased 200 basis points to 27.7% due primarily to the increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales.\n\n- Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 170 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.\n- Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.\n\nProductivity-driven cost savings delivered 60 basis points of benefit to SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales.\n\nIn the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the G illette intangible asset. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the limited market portfolio restructuring program. For further discussion of the G illette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOperating margin was unchanged at 22.1% as the increase in gross margin was more than fully offset by the increase in SG &amp;A as a percentage of net sales and the non-cash impairment charge, as discussed above.\n\nOperating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, as discussed above.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n- Interest ex pense was $925 million, an increase of $169 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates.\n- Interest income was $473 million, an increase of $166 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates.\n- Other  non-operating  income  was  unchanged  at  $668  million  as  gains  from  the  sale  of  minor  brands  and  an  increase  in  net  non-operating  benefits  on postretirement plans were fully offset by a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.",

The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by unfavorable geographic mix impacts, partially offset by decreases due to higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation.\n\n## Net Earnings\n\nEarnings before income taxes increased $408 million, or 2%, to $18.8 billion due to the increase in operating income discussed above. Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in earnings before income tax es, partially offset by the increase in the effective income tax  rate discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.\n\nNet earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n\nDiluted EPS increased $0.12, or 2%, to $6.02 due primarily to the increase in net earnings.\n\n## SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation.

Ongoing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sweetened beverages; the effects or perceived effects of the usage of weight-loss drugs on consumption patterns; potential new or increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; potential new or increased governmental regulations on particular ingredients or additives in our beverages and packaging, or on manufacturing processes; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n## If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\n\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients or processing; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients, raw materials or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of thirdparty studies (whether or not scientifically valid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources, the product manufacturing process and our packaging; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\n## Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards that we expect our operations, bottling partners and contract manufacturers to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners at times have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products. We and our bottling partners have had, and may in the future need, to recall products if they become contaminated or adulterated by any means, or if they are mislabeled or do not meet applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, we or our bottling partners and products have been, and could continue to be, subject to inspection by federal, state and local authorities, which could result in the identification of product quality or safety issues. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time, and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity, all of which could cause our business to suffer.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients, such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners, color additives and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products or result in additional governmental regulation.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as synthetic colors, nutritive (e.g., sugar, HFCS) and non-nutritive sweeteners, biotechnology-derived substances and other additives; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI), a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (BPA), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers' preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage",

This modest growth reflects the segment's performance amid market conditions and strategic pricing decisions (3% price increase offset by a -1% mix impact). Walmart, on the other hand, emphasized expense leverage as a key part of its operating discipline, aiming to ensure net sales grow faster than operating expenses. Given Walmart's strategy, the 2% net sales growth from P&G's Beauty segment would need to be managed carefully in terms of cost structure to maintain profitability and efficiency, especially in a category showing minimal volume growth.",

      "answer": "The Quaker Recall negatively affected PepsiCo's operating profit by 14 percentage points, primarily reflecting the significant drop in organic volume and associated charges, which was partially offset by insurance recovery and productivity savings. In contrast, Colgate-Palmolive reported a direct $25 million absolute reduction in operating profit due to its Fabuloso recall.

Ongoing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sweetened beverages; the effects or perceived effects of the usage of weight-loss drugs on consumption patterns; potential new or increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; potential new or increased governmental regulations on particular ingredients or additives in our beverages and packaging, or on manufacturing processes; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n## If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\n\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients or processing; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients, raw materials or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of thirdparty studies (whether or not scientifically valid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources, the product manufacturing process and our packaging; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\n## Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards that we expect our operations, bottling partners and contract manufacturers to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners at times have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products. We and our bottling partners have had, and may in the future need, to recall products if they become contaminated or adulterated by any means, or if they are mislabeled or do not meet applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, we or our bottling partners and products have been, and could continue to be, subject to inspection by federal, state and local authorities, which could result in the identification of product quality or safety issues. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time, and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity, all of which could cause our business to suffer.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients, such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners, color additives and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products or result in additional governmental regulation.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as synthetic colors, nutritive (e.g., sugar, HFCS) and non-nutritive sweeteners, biotechnology-derived substances and other additives; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI), a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (BPA), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers' preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage",

The decision resulted in an increase in the obligations of the Retirement Plan, which based on the current funded status of the Retirement Plan and depending on further developments in the litigation, may require a cash contribution by the Company in 2025. In June 2023, we filed a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court requesting permission for an appeal to that court, which was denied in October 2023. Also, in June 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enter a revised final judgment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the 'District Court') to address certain unresolved calculation issues, which we opposed. In March 2024, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion and found for the plaintiffs on those calculation issues. We have appealed that decision to the Second Circuit. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we announced a voluntary recall of select Fabuloso multi-purpose cleaner products sold in the United States and Canada. The costs associated with the voluntary recall had a $25 impact on our Operating profit in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative'). All initiatives under the program have been implemented and the program concluded on December 31, 2024. The 2022 Global Productivity Initiative resulted in the reallocation of resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, efficiencies in our operations and the streamlining of our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Total pretax charges from the implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were $228 ($186 aftertax). Total annualized pretax  savings from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were approximately $125 ($100 aftertax). See 'Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges' below and Note 3, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred pretax costs of $85 (aftertax costs of $73) and $32 (aftertax costs of $25), respectively, resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative.\n\n## Outlook\n\nLooking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, including as a result of inflation, high interest rates, foreign currency volatility and developments in trade relations following the imposition of new and/or additional tariffs by the United States and other countries. We have taken and are taking additional pricing to try to offset the increases in raw and packaging material costs we have seen in recent years. This has negatively impacted consumer demand for our products. Additionally, inflation has impacted the broader economy with consumers around the world facing widespread rising prices as well as high interest rates resulting from measures to address inflation.\n\nRecent developments in trade relations and the imposition of new and/or additional tariffs by the United States and other countries, including following the United States' February 2025 executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, may contribute to inflationary pressures and, as a result, may impact consumer demand for our products. We are following the dynamic situation closely and evaluating the impact of such tariffs and any retaliatory actions taken by other countries on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we have made and will make efforts to mitigate the impact of these and any additional tariffs imposed by the United States and/or other countries, they could impact the cost and/or price of our products, the cost and availability of raw and packaging materials and commodities and/or consumer demand for our products due to, among other things, the impact of such tariffs on the global economy, inflationary pressures or geopolitical relations.\n\nSuch inflation and developments in trade relations as well as high interest rates may negatively impact consumer consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to 'private label' or to our lower-priced product offerings. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, these changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. In light of this challenging environment, we ex pect continued volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term.",

Meanwhile, Costco's U.S. operations account for a substantial portion of its business, contributing 86% of net sales and operating income in 2024, and the company is particularly exposed to risks in high-volume markets like California, which accounts for 27% of U.S. net sales.

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.  These  Risk  Factors should be carefully rev iewed in conjunction with  Management ' s  Discussion  and Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Business and Operating Risks\n\n## We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.\n\nOur financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 86% and 85% of net sales and operating income in 2024. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 27% of U.S. net sales in 2024. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher v olume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adv ersely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations,  particularly  in  California,  and  our  Canadian  operations  could  arise  from,  among  other  things:  slow  growth  or  declines  in  comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negativ e trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher lev els of unemployment and depressed home v alues; and failing to consistently prov ide high quality and innov ativ e new products.\n\nWe may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as  local  community  actions  opposed  to  the  location  of  our  warehouses  or  depots  at  specific  sites  and  the  adoption  of  local  laws  restricting  our operations and env ironmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions hav e enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prev ent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectiv ely manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our future growth and profitability.\n\nWe  seek  to  expand  in  existing  markets  to  attain  a  greater  ov erall  market  share.  A  new  warehouse  may  draw  members  away  from  our  existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability.\n\nWe intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot  ensure  that  new  warehouses  and  new  e-commerce  sites  will  be  profitable  and  future  profitability  could  be  delayed  or  otherwise  materially adversely affected.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported 5% net sales growth in its Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment, indicating steady demand for these essential products. Walmart emphasizes expense leverage, aiming to grow net sales faster than operating expenses. This operational discipline likely pressures suppliers like P&G to maintain competitive pricing and promotional efficiency. In turn, Walmart may prioritize shelf space and promotional support for high-performing, cost-effective brands, shaping how P&G positions its Baby, Feminine & Family Care products in a value-driven retail environment.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported that foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by $589 million in fiscal 2024 due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, which includes both transactional and translational effects. This highlights PG's significant exposure to currency risk given its global operations. In contrast, Altria generated $8,753 million in operating cash flow during 2024, which includes net earnings of $11,264 million, and shows relative stability despite potential FX fluctuations, likely due to its primarily U.S.-based operations. This comparison reveals that PG faces greater earnings volatility from foreign exchange movements, whereas Altria's cash flow appears more insulated from such risks.",

The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by unfavorable geographic mix impacts, partially offset by decreases due to higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation.\n\n## Net Earnings\n\nEarnings before income taxes increased $408 million, or 2%, to $18.8 billion due to the increase in operating income discussed above. Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in earnings before income tax es, partially offset by the increase in the effective income tax  rate discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.\n\nNet earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n\nDiluted EPS increased $0.12, or 2%, to $6.02 due primarily to the increase in net earnings.\n\n## SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs which are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our consolidated effective tax rate are included in Corporate. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on items included in the Corporate segment.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\nGross margin increased 350 basis points to 51.4% of net sales. The increase in gross margin was due to:\n\n- a 220 basis-point increase from manufacturing productivity savings,\n- 160 basis points of lower commodity costs and\n- a 170 basis-point increase from higher pricing.\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\n- an 80 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix including the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand,\n- a 60 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,\n- 30 basis points of product and packaging investments and\n- 30 basis points of one-time manufacturing related costs including capacity startup costs.\n\nTotal SG&amp;A increased 10% to $23.3 billion due to increased marketing spending and overhead costs. SG &amp;A as a percentage of net sales increased 200 basis points to 27.7% due primarily to the increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales.\n\n- Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 170 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.\n- Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.\n\nProductivity-driven cost savings delivered 60 basis points of benefit to SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales.\n\nIn the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the G illette intangible asset. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the limited market portfolio restructuring program. For further discussion of the G illette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOperating margin was unchanged at 22.1% as the increase in gross margin was more than fully offset by the increase in SG &amp;A as a percentage of net sales and the non-cash impairment charge, as discussed above.\n\nOperating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, as discussed above.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n- Interest ex pense was $925 million, an increase of $169 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates.\n- Interest income was $473 million, an increase of $166 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates.\n- Other  non-operating  income  was  unchanged  at  $668  million  as  gains  from  the  sale  of  minor  brands  and  an  increase  in  net  non-operating  benefits  on postretirement plans were fully offset by a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.",

      "question": "How did the growth in Sam's Club's comparable sales in fiscal 2024 compare to the factors affecting Costco's comparable sales, particularly in terms of e-commerce and membership dynamics?",
      "answer": "Sam's Club reported a 2.3% increase in comparable sales for fiscal 2024, driven by growth in transactions and average ticket, with strong performance in grocery and health and wellness categories. E-commerce contributed approximately 1.7% to this growth. Meanwhile, Costco highlighted that its comparable sales could be negatively impacted by disruptions in supply chain, failure to maintain membership growth and loyalty, and challenges in predicting consumer preferences. Specifically, Costco emphasized that damage to its brand or reputation could reduce renewal rates and negatively affect comparable sales. Therefore, while Sam's Club experienced measurable e-commerce-driven growth, Costco's exposure to brand and membership risks suggests a more fragile foundation for sustaining comparable sales growth.",

      "answer": "PEP's operating profit growth was primarily driven by effective net pricing, productivity savings, and favorable prior-year charges, which helped offset input cost pressures in 2023. MDLZ also relied on net pricing, including carryover effects from 2021 and new pricing actions in 2022, to counteract higher raw material costs, particularly in dairy, packaging, and energy. However, MDLZ\u2019s input cost increases were only partially offset by pricing, as operating income margin still declined from 16.2% in 2021 to 11.2% in 2022. This suggests that while both companies used net pricing as a strategy, PEP experienced more direct operating profit growth (noted as a 4% increase), whereas MDLZ faced margin pressure despite pricing actions.",

      "answer": "PEP reported pension liabilities of $216 million in 2022, up from $0 in 2020, indicating a growing obligation. PEP's expected pension payments show a declining trend from $1,110 million in 2022 to $5,385 million spread across 2027\u20132031, suggesting a long-term reduction in pension exposure. Meanwhile, PM reported $294 million in pension-related amortization of net losses in 2022, which could be tied to similar long-term pension obligations. The increase in PEP\u2019s near-term liability and the long-term payout schedule may signal ongoing pension funding pressures that could lead to future amortization losses akin to those seen at PM.",

      "question": "How did the growth in comparable sales at Sam's Club in fiscal 2023 influence MDLZ's sales strategy for grocery items, and how does this compare to TGT's reported performance in digitally originated sales growth?",
      "answer": "Sam's Club reported a 14.6% increase in comparable sales in fiscal 2023, driven by growth in transactions and average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. This likely supported MDLZ's sales through its distribution to club stores, reinforcing the importance of grocery items in their portfolio. Meanwhile, TGT emphasized digitally originated sales growth as a key performance driver, with stores fulfilling the majority of digital orders. This indicates that while MDLZ benefits from strong in-store grocery performance at Sam's Club, TGT is leveraging digital fulfillment to drive comparable sales growth, highlighting differing growth levers across the two retailers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MDLZ \u2192 Sam's Club: MDLZ sells to club stores like Sam's Club, which saw a 14.6% increase in comparable sales in fiscal 2023, particularly in grocery and health and wellness categories.",
        "Hop 2: Sam's Club \u2192 Comparable Sales: Sam's Club's comparable sales growth was significantly influenced by higher transaction volume and average ticket, with digital sales contributing approximately 0.8% to this metric in fiscal 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Comparable Sales \u2190 TGT: TGT reported that digitally originated sales were a major contributor to comparable sales growth, with stores fulfilling most digital orders via pickup, delivery, or shipment, and emphasized this as a key driver of long-term profitability."

      "question": "How does the rate of compensation increase assumption used in Colgate's 2023 postretirement plan valuation compare to the rate used by Philip Morris for the same category of benefits, and what does this imply about their respective long-term liability growth expectations?",
      "answer": "Colgate used a 3.00% rate of compensation increase for its 2023 postretirement plan, as shown in the table from its 10-K filing, while Philip Morris used a lower rate of 2.05% for its pension plans in the same year. This difference suggests that Colgate expects higher wage growth impacting its postretirement liabilities compared to Philip Morris, which could result in faster-growing obligations for Colgate if actual compensation increases align with its assumptions.",

        "Hop 1: CL \u2192 Postretirement Plan: Colgate disclosed a 3.00% rate of compensation increase assumption for its postretirement plan in 2023.",

        "Hop 3: Rate of Compensation Increase \u2190 PM: Philip Morris disclosed a 2.05% rate of compensation increase for its pension plans in 2023, which is the most directly comparable metric from its disclosures."

Meanwhile, MDLZ reported $1,096 million in unfavorable currency translation effects, largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Argentine peso and other emerging market currencies. While Colgate's FX drag was partially offset by strong organic sales growth (16.8%), MDLZ's FX losses were not similarly mitigated by volume or pricing gains in the same region. Both companies highlight exposure to currency volatility in Argentina, but Colgate\u2019s operating profit margin in Latin America still improved (31.9%) due to pricing and cost savings, contrasting with MDLZ\u2019s direct revenue reduction.",

Organic sales growth was led by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2024 versus 2023 was due to increases in Oral Care, Home Care and Personal Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the surface cleaner and hand dish categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the underarm protection category.\n\nOperating profit in Latin America increased 8% in 2024 to $1,526, or 140 bps to 31.9% as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (220 bps), partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative ex penses (100 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in G ross profit was due to higher pricing and cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (290 bps), partially offset by significantly higher raw and packaging material costs (540 bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs.

T he principal forwardlooking statements in this report include statements regarding: our future financial and operational performance, our strategy for growth, the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the funding of debt maturities, the execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments, the expected compliance with debt cov enants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions  regarding  future  div idends,  the  expected  contributions  and  payments  related  to  our  pension  plan,  the  expected  return  on  plan  assets,  the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the adequacy of our reserv es for general liability, workers' compensation, and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserv es for, claims, litigation, and the resolution of tax matters, our expectations regarding our contractual obligations,  liabilities,  and  v endor  income,  the  expected  ability  to  recognize  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  timing  of  such  recognition,  our expectations regarding arrangements with our partners, and changes in our assumptions and expectations.\n\nAll such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Priv ate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

T he  most  important  factors  which  could  cause  our  actual  results  to  differ  from  our  forward-looking  statements  are  set  forth  in  our description  of  risk  factors  included  in Part  I,  Item  1A,  Risk  Factors  to  this  Form  10-K,  which  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\n\n## Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nAs of  February 1, 2025, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations and short-term inv estments.  Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations, including fixed rate debt hedged using floating rate interest rate swaps, compared to our floating rate short-term inv estments. As of February 1, 2025, our floating rate short-term inv estments exceeded our floating rate debt obligations by approximately $1.7 billion. Based on our financial position as of February 1, 2025, the annualized effect of a 1 percentage point increase in  floating  interest  rates  on  our  floating  rate  short-term inv estments, net of our floating rate debt obligations, would increase our earnings before income taxes by $17 million. In general, we expect our floating rate debt obligations to be in line with our floating rate short-term inv estments ov er time, but that may vary in different interest rate and economic env ironments.  See further description of our debt and deriv ativ e instruments in  Notes 15  and 16  to  the Financial Statements.\n\nWe record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present v alue; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position as of  February 1, 2025, the annualized effect of a 1 percentage point increase/(decrease) in interest rates would increase/(decrease) earnings before income taxes by $17 million.\n\nIn addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan. T he v alue of our pension liabilities is inv ersely related to changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted av erage discount rate would increase annual expense by $33 million. T o protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and deriv ativ e instruments in our pension plan trust. As of February 1, 2025, we had hedged 70 percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liabilities.\n\nAs  more  fully  described  in Note  22  to  the  Financial  Statements,  we  are  exposed  to  market  returns  on  accumulated  team  member  balances  in  our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making inv estments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans.\n\nThere hav e been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.\n\n2024 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the deferred income tax impact on pension obligations differ between PEP's 2022 disclosures and MO's 2022 disclosures, and what does this imply about their respective tax treatment of long-term benefit liabilities?",
      "answer": "PEP reported a deferred income tax amount of $570 million related to its pension obligations in 2022, while MO reported a total deferred income tax impact of $467 million across its benefit plans in the same year. This comparison indicates that both companies recognize significant tax implications from their pension liabilities, though MO's broader benefit plan structure includes additional components like ABI and currency translation adjustments, which influence the overall deferred tax calculation differently than PEP's more focused pension disclosure.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported 1% net sales growth in its Beauty segment for fiscal year 2024. In contrast, Target's Beauty segment saw an increase in net sales from $12,538 million in 2023 to $13,173 million in 2024, representing a $635 million dollar increase. While PG's growth is minimal at 1%, Target's Beauty segment experienced a more substantial absolute dollar growth, indicating potentially stronger retail-level demand for beauty products despite PG's modest performance in this category.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $949 million (9.3%), due to favorable currency (3.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp), higher net pricing (1.4 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe believe the \"Excluding Fuel\" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. V olatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. (1)\n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. For fiscal 2021, gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.\n\nMembership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company had $4.5 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consists of acquired trade names. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement\n\nThe Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Refer to Note 8 for more information.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option, are measured on a recurring basis (generally using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy) and recognized within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value changes, along with certain other immaterial investment activity, resulted in net losses of $0.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.7 billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Beauty segment experienced a net sales growth of 1% in 2024, driven by a 4% price increase offset by a -1% mix impact. This modest growth contrasts with Costco's stronger international sales growth, which saw increases of 9% in both 2023 and 2024 for its 'Other International' regions. However, P&G's Beauty segment maintained a substantial net balance of $13.7 billion as of June 30, 2024, indicating continued scale despite slower growth. The connection suggests that while Costco's international expansion could potentially offer distribution advantages, P&G's Beauty segment growth is more influenced by pricing strategies and product mix rather than external sales channel dynamics.",

      "answer": "Colgate reported a reduction in long-term debt from $7,343 million in 2020 to $7,206 million in 2021, indicating a deleveraging trend. Meanwhile, PepsiCo disclosed that the expected life of equity awards increased from 5 years in 2019 to 7 years in 2021. However, industry data (as reflected in the 2021 filings) showed a general decline in expected life assumptions, with a range of 4.2 to 5.4 years in 2021 compared to 4.3 to 5.9 years in 2020. This suggests that while Colgate was reducing debt, PepsiCo was extending equity award horizons contrary to the industry trend.",

      "answer": "Colgate's Oral, Personal and Home Care segment achieved 8.1% organic sales growth in 2024, while Procter & Gamble's Beauty segment reported 3% organic sales growth for the same period. During the same year, Target's Beauty segment sales increased from $12,538 million to $13,173 million, reflecting a 5.1% year-over-year growth. Colgate's stronger growth in beauty-related personal care products could enhance its leverage in negotiations with retailers like Target, especially as P&G's Beauty growth lags behind Colgate's performance, potentially impacting shelf space and promotional strategies in beauty categories.",

This short-term inclusion affects year-over-year revenue comparisons by adding a partial-year revenue component that no longer exists in 2022. According to MO's revenue recognition policy, revenues from such business activities would be recognized net of sales incentives, returns, and discounts, based on estimates derived from historical data and contractual terms. Since the seafood business was only owned for part of the year, MO's approach\u2014recording revenue net of estimated incentives and returns\u2014would influence how such temporary revenue streams are reflected in consolidated financial statements, particularly when assessing performance consistency across reporting periods.",

These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n## Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nNote 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Altria's consolidated financial statements. In most instances, Altria must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under GAAP.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in Altria's consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between Altria's estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of Altria's consolidated financial statements:\n\n- Revenue Recognition: Altria's businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. Net revenues are defined as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. Altria's businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\n\nAltria's businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. Expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nFor further discussion, see Note 3. Revenues from Contracts with Customers to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n\n- Depreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation: Altria depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes its definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\n\nAltria reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. These analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If Altria determines that an impairment exists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. Altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\n\nAltria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require Altria to perform an interim review. Altria has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, Altria will perform a single step quantitative impairment test. Additionally, Altria has the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit, but is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value in the period identified.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

In return for these services, the new joint venture is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our actual costs without markup. Subsequent to the transaction close date, the purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. We expect to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 billion in our PBNA and Europe segments in the first quarter of 2022 as a result of this transaction.\n\nWe have reclassified $1.8 billion of assets, primarily accounts receivable, net, and inventories of $0.5 billion, goodwill and other intangible assets of $0.6 billion and property, plant and equipment of",

This longer amortization period for retirees could lead to a more gradual impact on PEP's financial statements compared to MO.

In contrast, MO reported a Prior Service Credit of $1 million in 2024, which would equate to a $0.013 million positive impact on its Post-Retirement Benefits. This indicates that PG\u2019s Prior Service Credit has a proportionally larger positive effect on its Post-Retirement Benefits compared to MO.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Sam's Club segment operating income at WMT in fiscal 2022 compare in magnitude and strategic driver to the reduction in Simplify to Grow Program costs that contributed to MDLZ's operating income growth in 2021?",
      "answer": "Sam's Club segment operating income at WMT increased by $0.4 billion in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher sales and reduced tobacco sales, which improved operating margins. In contrast, MDLZ reported a reduction in Simplify to Grow Program costs that contributed to a $233 million increase in segment operating income in 2021. While WMT's growth was driven by strong sales performance and margin improvements, MDLZ's improvement was attributed to cost optimization initiatives, including lower productivity-related expenses and reduced Simplify to Grow Program costs. These distinct strategies\u2014revenue-led margin expansion versus cost restructuring\u2014reflect different approaches to enhancing operating income in response to inflationary and pandemic-related pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe believe the \"Excluding Fuel\" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. V olatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. (1)\n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. For fiscal 2021, gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.\n\nMembership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

          "chunk_text": "internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as 'Swiss tax reform'. Based on these Federal / Cantonal events, our position is the enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. See Note 16, Income Taxes , for more information.\n\n## Summary of Results\n\n- Net revenues were approximately $28.7 billion in 2021 and $26.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 8.0% in 2021 and an increase of 2.8% in 2020. In 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020, though some markets were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped prior-year strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, our out-of-home consumption businesses, which experienced significant negative impacts from the pandemic in 2020, continued to recover, particularly our gum and candy, foodservice and world travel retail businesses.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Gourmet Foods, Grenade and Hu in 2021 and Give &amp; Go in 2020.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Give &amp; Go in 2020 and Perfect Snacks in 2019. These items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, as well as the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa.\n- Organic Net Revenue increased 5.2% to $28.0 billion in 2021 and increased 3.7% to $26.8 billion in 2020. Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing, despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).\n- Diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International increased 23.1% to $3.04 in 2021 and decreased 8.2% to $2.47 in 2020.\n- -Diluted EPS increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prioryear loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower Simplify to Grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes.\n- -Diluted EPS decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prior-year benefit from initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, loss on debt extinguishment, unfavorable year-over year change in equity method investee items, higher intangible asset impairment charges, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lapping a prior-year gain on divestiture and lapping the prior-year benefit from pension participation changes. These factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions, higher Adjusted EPS, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower Simplify to Grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps.",

      "answer": "Sam's Club reported a comparable sales growth of 14.6% in fiscal 2023, which reflects strong performance driven by transaction growth, average ticket increases, and inflation impacts in certain categories. As a direct competitor to COST in the warehouse club segment, this growth could indicate competitive pressure on COST to maintain or grow its own comparable sales. Meanwhile, TGT also disclosed its focus on comparable sales growth as a key driver of profitability and guest shopping frequency, though it did not report a specific growth percentage for 2023. Therefore, the strong performance of Sam's Club may indirectly highlight the importance of comparable sales trends in evaluating COST's competitive strategy relative to broader retail peers like TGT.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM reported $314 million in net losses amortized as part of its post-employment benefit costs, while MO reported $19 million for the same category. This significant difference suggests that PM faced considerably more pressure from accumulated losses in its post-employment benefit obligations compared to MO, potentially indicating either a more underfunded position or greater market-related volatility in asset performance for PM\u2019s benefit plans.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, WMT's Sam's Club segment saw an increase in segment operating income despite margin pressure from higher raw material costs, which were partially offset by favorable sales mix and cost management. Meanwhile, CL's Hill's Pet Nutrition segment experienced a 40 basis point decline in operating profit margin, with higher raw and packaging material costs contributing a 300 basis point negative impact, partially offset by pricing actions and cost savings initiatives. Both companies faced similar pressures from rising raw material costs, but the effect on operating margins was more pronounced at CL due to less offsetting leverage from sales growth and pricing.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe believe the \"Excluding Fuel\" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. V olatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. (1)\n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. For fiscal 2021, gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.\n\nMembership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

Organic sales in Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 13.5% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by the United States and Europe.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was due to organic sales growth in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.\n\nOperating profit in Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 14% in 2021 to $901, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 30 bps to 27.2%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (40 bps) and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (300 bps), partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (100 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (110 bps), partially offset by lower overhead expenses (80 bps). This decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to the portion of costs incurred in 2020 in connection with the voluntary recall of selected canned dog food products due to potentially elevated levels of Vitamin D resulting from a supplier error for which Hill's was not indemnified.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Beauty segment contributed only 1% to its overall net sales growth in 2024, indicating limited momentum in that category for P&G. Meanwhile, Target reported an increase in its Beauty category sales from $12,538 million in 2023 to $13,173 million in 2024, a $635 million or ~5% year-over-year growth. Costco, by contrast, reported a 5% net sales growth company-wide in 2024. This suggests that while P&G's Beauty segment had minimal impact on its overall growth, Target saw significant standalone growth in Beauty, aligning more closely with Costco's broader performance.",

      "question": "How would a 25-basis-point decrease in discount rates impact the pension expense and cash flow obligations of both Walmart and PepsiCo, given their differing sensitivities to pension benefit obligation changes?",
      "answer": "A 25-basis-point decrease in discount rates would increase Walmart's pension benefit obligation (PBO) by $500 million and decrease its pension expense by $29 million, according to HON_10k_2022.pdf. In contrast, the same decrease would increase PepsiCo's pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense, as noted in PEP_10k_2022.pdf, although PepsiCo expects its total pension expense to decrease in 2022 due to higher discount rates and plan changes. Walmart's exposure is partially mitigated by its prior remeasurement of Asda\u2019s pension obligation and the release of accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the sale of UK and Japan operations, as detailed in WMT_10k_2022.pdf. This divergence in sensitivity highlights differing financial risks between the two companies related to pension liabilities under similar actuarial assumptions.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive's operating profit in 2024 was negatively impacted by inflation and trade developments, including new tariffs, which contributed to higher raw and packaging material costs and reduced consumer demand. These pressures led to a shift in consumer purchasing toward lower-priced offerings, affecting sales volumes and product mix. Similarly, PepsiCo experienced a decrease in operating profit by 11%, with operating cost increases cited as a primary driver. This shows that both companies faced significant margin pressure from rising input costs and macroeconomic volatility, though Colgate noted ongoing mitigation efforts through pricing and productivity, while PepsiCo highlighted the compounding effect of restructuring and impairment charges.",

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nlawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ('ERISA') seeking the recalculation of benefits and other relief associated with a 2005 residual annuity amendment to the Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees' Retirement Income Plan (the 'Retirement Plan'). The decision resulted in an increase in the obligations of the Retirement Plan, which based on the current funded status of the Retirement Plan and depending on further developments in the litigation, may require a cash contribution by the Company in 2025. In June 2023, we filed a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court requesting permission for an appeal to that court, which was denied in October 2023. Also, in June 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enter a revised final judgment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the 'District Court') to address certain unresolved calculation issues, which we opposed. In March 2024, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion and found for the plaintiffs on those calculation issues. We have appealed that decision to the Second Circuit. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we announced a voluntary recall of select Fabuloso multi-purpose cleaner products sold in the United States and Canada. The costs associated with the voluntary recall had a $25 impact on our Operating profit in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative'). All initiatives under the program have been implemented and the program concluded on December 31, 2024. The 2022 Global Productivity Initiative resulted in the reallocation of resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, efficiencies in our operations and the streamlining of our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Total pretax charges from the implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were $228 ($186 aftertax). Total annualized pretax  savings from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were approximately $125 ($100 aftertax). See 'Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges' below and Note 3, Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred pretax costs of $85 (aftertax costs of $73) and $32 (aftertax costs of $25), respectively, resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative.\n\n## Outlook\n\nLooking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, including as a result of inflation, high interest rates, foreign currency volatility and developments in trade relations following the imposition of new and/or additional tariffs by the United States and other countries. We have taken and are taking additional pricing to try to offset the increases in raw and packaging material costs we have seen in recent years. This has negatively impacted consumer demand for our products. Additionally, inflation has impacted the broader economy with consumers around the world facing widespread rising prices as well as high interest rates resulting from measures to address inflation.\n\nRecent developments in trade relations and the imposition of new and/or additional tariffs by the United States and other countries, including following the United States' February 2025 executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, may contribute to inflationary pressures and, as a result, may impact consumer demand for our products. We are following the dynamic situation closely and evaluating the impact of such tariffs and any retaliatory actions taken by other countries on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we have made and will make efforts to mitigate the impact of these and any additional tariffs imposed by the United States and/or other countries, they could impact the cost and/or price of our products, the cost and availability of raw and packaging materials and commodities and/or consumer demand for our products due to, among other things, the impact of such tariffs on the global economy, inflationary pressures or geopolitical relations.\n\nSuch inflation and developments in trade relations as well as high interest rates may negatively impact consumer consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to 'private label' or to our lower-priced product offerings. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, these changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. In light of this challenging environment, we ex pect continued volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe believe the \"Excluding Fuel\" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. V olatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. (1)\n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. For fiscal 2021, gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.\n\nMembership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

      "answer": "Colgate's Oral, Personal and Home Care segment in Europe achieved 7.7% GAAP net sales growth with a 6.7% organic sales growth after adjusting for foreign exchange and acquisition/divestiture impacts, whereas Procter & Gamble's Fabric & Home Care segment reported 4% net sales growth that translated to 5% organic sales growth.

      "answer": "PEP's 14% revenue dependence on Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club, could be indirectly affected by the 14.6% comparable sales growth at Sam's Club in fiscal 2023, as this growth indicates strong retail performance that may increase demand for PEP's products. However, Walmart highlights a risk that increased e-commerce sales could reduce in-store traffic, thereby negatively impacting cross-store sales. This could, in turn, affect PEP if reduced foot traffic at Sam's Club locations leads to lower in-store beverage and snack purchases, potentially offsetting some of the benefits from overall sales growth.",

        "Hop 1: PEP \u2192 Sam's Club: PEP derived approximately 14% of its 2023 consolidated net revenue from sales to Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club, indicating a significant dependency on this customer.",
        "Hop 2: Sam's Club \u2192 Comparable Sales: In fiscal 2023, Sam's Club reported a 14.6% increase in comparable sales, driven by growth in transactions and average ticket, which could signal increased demand for products sold by PEP through this channel.",
        "Hop 3: Comparable Sales \u2190 WMT: Walmart notes that increased e-commerce sales could reduce in-store traffic, which may lower cross-store sales opportunities, potentially affecting the sales of products like those from PEP in physical locations."

Meanwhile, TGT experienced a reduction in its pension-related accumulated other comprehensive loss from $735 million in 2021 to $583 million in 2022, a $152 million improvement.

      "answer": "MDLZ's pension costs would increase by $2 million due to a 50-basis-point increase in the discount rate, as disclosed in its 2024 10-K. This reflects the general financial principle that lower discount rates increase pension liabilities, and vice versa. KO reports a total pension plan liability in AOCI of $1,694 million as of December 31, 2024, which is also influenced by similar discount rate fluctuations. Therefore, a change in discount rate that affects pension costs (as seen with MDLZ) would also impact the magnitude of pension liabilities recorded in AOCI (as seen with KO), illustrating the consistent application of pension accounting principles across both companies.",

In contrast, Sam's Club saw measurable contributions from eCommerce to comparable sales (1.7% in fiscal 2024 and 0.8% in fiscal 2023), suggesting a more integrated digital infrastructure that complements in-store operations.

This suggests that P&G is investing more heavily overall in capital expenditures compared to PepsiCo\u2019s FLNA segment, potentially indicating a stronger emphasis on asset-intensive growth or operational improvements in North America for P&G.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola's and Colgate's pension cost assumptions reflect different trends in compensation increase rates, given the observed decline in broader industry compensation growth?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola assumes a constant 3.75% rate of compensation increase across all pension and postretirement plans in 2023, while Colgate uses a more nuanced 3.50% rate for its pension plans and 3.22% for U.S. pension plans specifically. This contrasts with the broader industry trend showing declining compensation growth from 1.77% in 2021 to 1.98% in 2023 as reported in PM's disclosures, suggesting Coca-Cola maintains more optimistic assumptions while Colgate's approach better reflects the moderating industry trend.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive achieved a 390 basis point increase in gross profit margin in 2023 due to pricing actions, which was a key driver of their overall margin expansion to 58.2%. This pricing strategy was part of a broader effort that included cost savings initiatives. In contrast, Coca-Cola acknowledged using price increases to offset inflationary pressures on raw materials but noted risks around consumer sensitivity and potential volume declines. While Colgate successfully leveraged pricing to improve margins, Coca-Cola's approach carried more uncertainty due to market dynamics affecting consumer beverage demand.",

        "Hop 3: Price Increases \u2190 KO: Coca-Cola implemented price increases to offset raw material cost inflation but faced risks of reduced sales volume and consumer shift to lower-priced offerings"

      "question": "How did MDLZ's $107 million favorable volume/mix contribution to adjusted operating income growth in 2021 compare to MO's net revenue recognition adjustments related to sales incentives and excise taxes during the same period, and what does this reveal about their respective financial reporting approaches in the consumer goods sector?",
      "answer": "MDLZ reported that favorable volume/mix contributed $107 million to its adjusted operating income growth in 2021, reflecting strong demand across product categories like chocolate and biscuits. In contrast, MO disclosed that its net revenues are adjusted for sales incentives (which are based on historical volume and redemption rates) and include excise taxes billed to customers. MO also noted that historically, aggregate differences between estimates (including those for sales incentives) and actual amounts have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. This reveals that MDLZ directly quantifies the impact of volume/mix dynamics on operating income, while MO's net revenue recognition involves more forward-looking estimates that are later reconciled with actuals, highlighting different financial reporting approaches to market dynamics within the consumer goods sector.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmeasures used by other companies. These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n## Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nNote 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Altria's consolidated financial statements. In most instances, Altria must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under GAAP.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in Altria's consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between Altria's estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of Altria's consolidated financial statements:\n\n- Revenue Recognition: Altria's businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. Net revenues are defined as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. Altria's businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\n\nAltria's businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. Expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nFor further discussion, see Note 3. Revenues from Contracts with Customers to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n\n- Depreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation: Altria depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes its definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\n\nAltria reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. These analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If Altria determines that an impairment exists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. Altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\n\nAltria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require Altria to perform an interim review. Altria has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, Altria will perform a single step quantitative impairment test. Additionally, Altria has the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit, but is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value in the period identified.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $949 million (9.3%), due to favorable currency (3.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp), higher net pricing (1.4 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.",

      "question": "Given PM's exposure to geopolitical and inflationary risks that negatively impact its net earnings, how does PG's Fabric & Home Care segment's $6,303 million in earnings before income taxes in 2023 contribute to PG's overall net earnings, and what does this imply about the relative stability of PG's business compared to PM's in the face of similar macroeconomic pressures?",
      "answer": "PM faces significant geopolitical and inflationary risks that negatively impact its net earnings, including disruptions to supply chains, currency fluctuations, and increased operating costs. In contrast, PG's Fabric & Home Care segment generated $6,303 million in earnings before income taxes in 2023, contributing significantly to PG's total net earnings of $14,738 million. This indicates that PG's business, particularly in the Fabric & Home Care segment, remains relatively stable and profitable despite macroeconomic pressures, suggesting a stronger resilience compared to PM's more volatile exposure to global risks.",

      "question": "How did the impact of rising raw and packaging material costs affect the gross profit margins of Walmart and Colgate-Palmolive in their most recent fiscal years, and how did the magnitude of these effects compare?",
      "answer": "Walmart experienced a 24.1% gross profit margin in FY2025, with the margin being negatively impacted by higher material costs, though the exact percentage impact is not quantified in the evidence. In contrast, Colgate-Palmolive specifically reported that higher raw and packaging material costs reduced its gross profit margin by 170 basis points in FY2024, despite achieving a 60.5% gross profit margin globally. This indicates that while both companies faced pressure from material costs, only Colgate quantified this impact, suggesting differing levels of transparency or severity in cost management challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: WMT \u2192 Gross Profit Margin: Walmart reported a gross profit margin of 24.1% in FY2025, up from 23.7% in FY2024, with rising material costs mentioned as a headwind.",
        "Hop 2: Gross Profit Margin \u2192 Material Costs: Colgate-Palmolive specifically quantified the negative impact of higher raw and packaging material costs at 170 basis points on its gross profit margin in FY2024.",
        "Hop 3: Material Costs \u2190 CL: Colgate-Palmolive's gross profit margin reached 60.5% in FY2024, but would have been 280 bps higher if not for the material cost increases, indicating a significant cost pressure."

      "answer": "Coca-Cola's interest coverage ratio would be impacted by the inclusion of PepsiCo's lower 2022 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $68 million, which would reduce the numerator of the ratio (income before tax, adjusted for interest and debt expense, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests). This adjustment would likely result in a lower interest coverage ratio, signaling a reduced capacity to meet interest obligations. This is particularly relevant given KO's significant net cash used in financing activities of $8,310 million in 2023, which underscores its reliance on debt financing and sensitivity to interest costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Interest Coverage Ratio: KO's interest coverage ratio depends on its financial structure, which includes significant debt financing and $8,310 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Interest Coverage Ratio \u2192 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests: The interest coverage ratio calculation subtracts net income attributable to noncontrolling interests from income before tax and interest expenses, as outlined in the methodology.",
        "Hop 3: Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests \u2190 PEP: PEP reported a $68 million net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2022, which would alter the calculation if used in KO's interest coverage ratio."

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive's shipping and handling costs, classified as Selling, General and Administrative expenses rather than Cost of Sales, inflated its gross profit margin by 910 basis points in 2023 compared to peers using alternative classifications. Meanwhile, PepsiCo experienced margin pressure from increased commodity costs in 2023, particularly affecting ingredients like corn, sugar, and packaging materials such as aluminum and PET resin. While Colgate's accounting policy artificially boosted gross margin visibility, PepsiCo actively managed commodity risk through fixed-price contracts, derivative instruments, and supplier diversification across multiple geographies. The two companies thus demonstrate contrasting influences on gross margin\u2014one structural/accounting in nature, the other operational and cost-driven.",

In contrast, PM reported $2,325 million in pension-related net losses in 2023, which directly contributes to increased pension liabilities, as evidenced by the negative impact shown in their financial metrics. This suggests PM faces significantly greater pension liability pressures than PEP, due to the magnitude of its net losses affecting long-term pension obligations.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported 2% Net Sales Growth in its Beauty division for fiscal 2022, indicating modest expansion in its dedicated beauty product line. In contrast, Target does not disclose specific growth figures for beauty and personal care alone, but includes it within its 'Other Merchandise' segment alongside baby gear, cleaning supplies, and pet products. This lack of granular reporting makes it difficult to isolate beauty performance at Target, but the bundling suggests beauty may not be a distinct growth driver in its retail strategy compared to PG's focused beauty division.",

(e)\n\nMerchandise sales - We record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store. Total revenues do not include sales tax because  we  are  a  pass-through  conduit  for  collecting  and  remitting  sales  taxes.  Generally,  guests  may  return  national  brand merchandise within 90 days of purchase and owned and exclusive brands within one year of purchase. Sales are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns and our expectation of future returns. As of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, the liability for estimated returns was $165 million and $139 million, respectively.\n\nWe routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Under the vast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record revenue and related costs gross. We concluded that we are the principal in these transactions for a number of reasons, most notably because we 1) control the overall economics of the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide goods to the customer. Merchandise received under these arrangements is not included in Inventory because the purchase and sale of this inventory are virtually simultaneous.\n\nRevenue from Target gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of issuance. Our gift cards  do  not  expire.  Based  on  historical  redemption  rates,  a  small  and  relatively  stable  percentage  of  gift  cards  will  never  be redeemed,  referred  to  as  \"breakage.\"  Estimated  breakage  revenue  is  recognized  over  time  in  proportion  to  actual  gift  card redemptions.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "WMT's Sam's Club segment reported a 68 basis point decrease in gross profit rate for fiscal 2022, driven in part by higher raw material costs and supply chain pressures, though partially offset by favorable sales mix and reduced tobacco sales. In contrast, CL's Hill's Pet Nutrition segment experienced a 300 basis point decrease in gross profit margin due to elevated raw and packaging material costs in fiscal 2022, which was only partially mitigated by pricing actions and cost savings from funding-the-growth initiatives. While both companies faced significant inflationary pressures, WMT managed the impact more effectively through mix improvements, whereas CL faced more severe cost escalation in pet nutrition inputs.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe believe the \"Excluding Fuel\" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. V olatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. (1)\n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. For fiscal 2021, gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.\n\nMembership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $949 million (9.3%), due to favorable currency (3.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp), higher net pricing (1.4 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.",

Organic sales in Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 13.5% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by the United States and Europe.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was due to organic sales growth in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.\n\nOperating profit in Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 14% in 2021 to $901, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 30 bps to 27.2%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (40 bps) and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (300 bps), partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (100 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (110 bps), partially offset by lower overhead expenses (80 bps). This decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to the portion of costs incurred in 2020 in connection with the voluntary recall of selected canned dog food products due to potentially elevated levels of Vitamin D resulting from a supplier error for which Hill's was not indemnified.",

      "answer": "PM was impacted by $246 million in customs duty assessments in Saudi Arabia, which was recorded as a reduction in net revenues specifically for combustible tobacco products in the SSEA, CIS & MEA segment in 2021. MO, on the other hand, reported a $613 million decline in net revenues for 2023, primarily driven by lower smokeable products segment performance. While PM's issue was a one-time customs-related charge impacting a specific geographic and product segment, MO's decline was broader and tied to reduced shipment volumes in its smokeable products business. Both companies experienced significant revenue pressures in similar product categories, but the causes and geographic contexts differ.",

      "answer": "TGT reported that comparable sales were a key driver of total sales growth, with the extra week in 2023 contributing $1,715 million to total sales. Meanwhile, Sam's Club experienced a 14.6% comparable sales increase in fiscal 2023, driven by growth in transactions and average ticket, including inflation impacts. Since COST competes directly with Sam's Club in the warehouse club segment, this strong performance by Sam's Club may intensify competitive pressure on COST, especially if TGT's own comparable sales growth supports further investment in competitive capabilities.",

        "Hop 1: TGT \u2192 Comparable Sales: TGT's total sales growth was significantly influenced by comparable sales, with the extra week in 2023 adding $1,715 million to total sales.",

      "answer": "P&G's BEAUTY segment experienced a $204 million decline in earnings before income taxes between 2023 and 2024, representing a 5.1% decrease. In comparison, Target disclosed that a 1 percentage point increase in floating interest rates would increase its earnings before income taxes by $5 million, while a 0.5 percentage point rate change could impact earnings by $7 million due to liability discounting effects. The BEAUTY segment's decline is more significant in magnitude than Target's estimated interest rate sensitivity, suggesting that internal business performance changes may pose greater earnings stability risks than market rate fluctuations for these companies.",

      "answer": "PEP's pension liabilities increased from $216 million in 2021 to $1,110 million in 2022, reflecting a significant rise in long-term pension obligations. This increase is part of a multi-year projection showing continued pension liabilities through 2031. Meanwhile, PG explicitly notes pension-related cost pressures as a key input cost factor that could impact its margins and cash flows. Therefore, while PEP is directly carrying the growing liability, PG faces operational exposure through pension-related cost increases that could affect its profitability and cost management strategies.",

        "Hop 1: PEP \u2192 Pension Liabilities: PEP's 2021 pension liability was $216 million, rising sharply to $1,110 million in 2022.",

Inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results  depend,  in  part,  on  our  continued  ability  to  manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and  sourcing  decisions,  while  maintaining  and  improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of  operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how  well  we  can  compete  with  our  local  and  global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all  of  our  categories,  we  compete  against  a  wide  variety  of global  and  local  competitors.  As  a  result,  we  experience ongoing  competitive  pressures  in  the  environments  in  which we  operate,  which  may  result  in  challenges  in  maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be  able  to  successfully  respond  to  competitive  factors  and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives,  product  delivery  windows  and  trade  terms.  In addition,  evolving  sales  channels  and  business  models  may affect  customer  and  consumer  preferences  as  well  as  market dynamics,  which,  for  example,  may  be  seen  in  the  growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry  into  certain  categories  and  growth  in  hard  discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing  sales  channels  and  business  models,  particularly  ecommerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe  sell  most  of  our  products  via  retail  customers,  which include  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty  beauty  stores  (including  airport  duty-free  stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores  and professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot  reach  agreement  with  a  key  customer  on  trade  terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if  a  key  customer  were  to  significantly  reduce  the  inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased  offerings  of  other  branded  manufacturers,  private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons,  significantly  tighten  product  delivery  windows  or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If  the  reputation  of  the  Company  or  one  or  more  of  our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation  of  our  brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and  our  financial  success  directly  depends  on  the  success  of our  brands.  The  success  of  our  brands  can  suffer  if  our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also  be negatively  impacted  if  the  Company  or  one  of  our  brands suffers  substantial  harm  to  its  reputation  due  to  a  significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions  of  certain  ingredients,  negative  perceptions  of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleumbased materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices, privacy lapses or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.  Additionally,  negative  or  inaccurate  postings  or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage  the reputation of our brands or the Company.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  real  or perceived  issues,  including  concerns  about  safety,  quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the  Company  or  our products  could  be  negatively  impacted,  and  our  results  of operations  or  cash  flows  could  suffer.  Our  Company  also devotes  time  and  resources  to  citizenship  efforts  that  are consistent  with  our  corporate  values  and  are  designed  to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation,  including  programs  driving  ethics  and  corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental  sustainability.  While  the  Company  has  many programs and initiatives  to  further  these  goals,  our  ability  to achieve  these  goals  is  impacted  in  part  by  the  actions  and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers. If these programs  are  not  executed  as  planned  or  suffer  negative publicity,  the  Company's  reputation  and  results  of  operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nDue to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract  manufacturers,  distributors,  contractors,  commercial banks,  joint  venture  partners  and  external  business  partners, for  certain  functions.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash  flows  could  be  adversely  impacted.  Further,  failure  of these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the",

In contrast, TGT reported pension liabilities of $152 million in 2021, which is significantly lower in scale and does not include multi-year forward projections.

('Ev irth'), a leading manufacturer of cakes and pastries in China. T he acquisition will continue to expand our growth in the cakes and pastries categories. The cash consideration paid for Ev irth totaled \u00a51.7 billion ($240 million), net of cash receiv ed.\n\nWe are working to complete the v aluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and hav e recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2024.\n\nWithin definite-liv ed intangible assets, we allocated $117 million to customer relationships which hav e an estimated useful life of 17 years. T he fair v alue of customer relationships at the acquisition date was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. The fair value measurements are based on significant unobserv able inputs, and thus represent Lev el 3 inputs. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair values of the intangible assets include discounted cash flows, customer attrition rates and discount rates.\n\nGoodwill of $122 million was determined as the excess of the purchase price ov er the fair v alue of the net assets acquired and arises principally as a result of expansion opportunities and synergies across China. None of the goodwill recognized will be deductible for income tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to the AMEA operating segment. For further detail, refer to Note 6. Goodw ill and Intangible Assets.\n\nWe incurred acquisition integration and contingent consideration adjustment costs of $8 million, acquisition-related costs of $3 million and an inv entory step-up charge of $3 million in 2024.\n\n## Ricolino\n\nOn November 1, 2022, we acquired 100% of the equity of Grupo Bimbo's confectionery business, Ricolino, located primarily in Mexico. The acquisition of Ricolino builds on our continued prioritization of fast-growing snacking segments in key geographies. The cash consideration paid for Ricolino totaled 26 billion Mexican pesos ($1.3 billion), net of cash receiv ed.\n\nWe incurred acquisition integration costs of $21 million in 2024, $50 million in 2023 and $11 million in 2022. In 2022, we also incurred an inv entory stepup charge of $5 million and recorded sev eral items within acquisition-related costs that resulted in income of $64 million as realized gains related to hedging contracts associated with acquisition funds more than offset other acquisition transaction costs.\n\n## Clif Bar\n\nOn August 1, 2022, we acquired 100% of the equity of Clif Bar &amp; Company ('Clif Bar'), a leading U.S. maker of nutritious energy bars with organic ingredients. T he acquisition expands our global snack bar business and complements our refrigerated snacking and performance nutrition bar portfolios. The total cash payment of $2.9 billion includes purchase price consideration of $2.6 billion, net of cash receiv ed, and one-time compensation expense of $0.3 billion  related  to  the  buyout  of  the  non-v ested  employee  stock  ownership  plan  (\"ESOP\")  shares.  T his  compensation  expense  is  considered  an acquisition-related cost. We also incurred a contingent consideration liability with an acquisition date fair v alue of $440 million.\n\nWe recorded  a  net  gain  in  acquisition  integration  costs  and  contingent  consideration  adjustments  of  $393  million  in  2024  and  incurred  acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments of $164 million in 2023 and $30 million in 2022. Refer to Note 10, Financial Instruments for additional information on the changes to the contingent consideration liability.

      "answer": "KO's Bottling Investments segment achieved strong volume growth of 11% in 2021, significantly outpacing CL's overall volume growth of 1.0% during the same period. This contrast is even more notable when factoring in foreign exchange effects: KO's Bottling Investments segment faced a 1% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, which dampened its reported results, while CL experienced a 1.5% favorable foreign exchange impact that supported its growth figures. This suggests KO's Bottling Investments segment demonstrated stronger underlying volume momentum despite currency headwinds, compared to CL's more modest volume expansion.",

This favorable impact was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the British pound sterling, South African rand, euro, Chinese yuan and Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; Latin America; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Turkish lira, Ethiopian birr and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading 'Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange' below.\n\n'Acquisitions and divestitures' generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company's performance. Refer to the heading 'Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands' above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency fluctuations will have a negative impact on our full year 2022 net operating revenues.\n\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows:\n\n",

The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 6 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and lower other operating charges, partially offset by higher annual incentive expense and increased marketing spending.\n\nOperating income for North America for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3,331 million and $2,471 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 7 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and category mix, effective cost management and lower other operating charges, partially offset by higher annual incentive expense and increased marketing spending.\n\nAsia Pacific's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2,325 million and $2,133 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 11 percent, a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 4 percent and lower other operating charges, partially offset by higher annual incentive expense and increased marketing spending.\n\nGlobal Ventures' operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $293 million, while the operating segment's operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $123 million. The change in operating income was primarily driven by revenue growth as a result of the reopening of Costa retail stores in the United Kingdom and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 6 percent.\n\nBottling Investments' operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $473 million and $308 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by volume growth of 11 percent, lower other operating charges and favorable price, category and package mix, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent.\n\nCorporate's operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2,383 million and $1,221 million, respectively. Operating loss in 2021 increased primarily as a result of higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense, increased marketing spending, increased charitable donations and higher other operating charges.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest income was $276 million in 2021, compared to $370 million in 2020, a decrease of $94 million, or 25 percent. This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates in certain of our international locations as well as lower investment balances.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense was $1,597 million in 2021, compared to $1,437 million in 2020, an increase of $160 million, or 11 percent. This increase was primarily due to charges of $650 million in 2021 versus charges of $484 million in 2020 associated with the extinguishment of long-term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Equity Income (Loss) - Net\n\nEquity income (loss) - net represents our Company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. In 2021, equity income was $1,438 million, compared to equity income of $978 million in 2020, an increase of $460 million, or 47 percent. This increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results reported by most of our equity method investees in 2021, as results in 2020 were more negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, along with a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact. In addition, the Company recorded net charges of $13 million and $216 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which represent the Company's proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.",

Organic sales (Net sales excluding, as applicable, the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure as discussed below, increased 4.5% in 2021.\n\nNet sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment were $14,110 in 2021, up 4.0% from 2020, due to net selling price increases of 2.5% and positive foreign exchange of 1.5%, while volume was flat. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment increased 2.5% in 2021.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was due to an increase in Oral Care organic sales, partially offset by a decrease in Personal Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The decrease in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales declines in the liquid hand soap and bar soap categories.\n\nThe Company's share of the global toothpaste market was 39.4% for full year 2021, down 0.3 share points from full year 2020, and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 30.9% for full year 2021, up 0.1 share points from full year 2020.

Organic sales for Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 13.5% in 2021.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to increases in organic sales in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's pension liability would decrease net periodic cost by $57 million with a 100 basis point discount rate increase, as shown in MET_10k_2023.pdf. TGT implemented an actual 37 basis point increase in their discount rate from 4.83% to 5.20% in 2023, as disclosed in TGT_10k_2023.pdf. This suggests TGT is proactively adjusting discount rate assumptions in their pension liability management, while PM quantifies but does not necessarily implement such rate changes in their approach.",

      "answer": "PG's Grooming segment achieved a 9% organic sales growth in 2024 despite a 5% total company net sales growth, indicating that Grooming outperformed other segments. PG maintained a significant net investment of $12,633 million in Grooming as of 2024, suggesting strategic prioritization of this segment. Meanwhile, COST reported a 5% total company net sales growth in 2024, which was consistent across U.S., Canada, and Other International regions. This comparison implies that while COST experienced steady but uniform growth, PG leveraged its investment in Grooming to achieve above-average performance within a slower-growing broader company context.",

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z International reported a 14.4% GAAP revenue growth, which is partially attributed to positive volume/mix and pricing effects. However, this growth occurs alongside an 8.0% volume decline in shipment volume dynamics, as seen in a similar industry context.

In 2022, the company spent $581 million in the region, or about 11.2% of its total capital spending of $5,207 million.

In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified because they contain words  such  as  'anticipate,'  'believ e,'  'continue,'  'could,'  'estimate,'  'expect,'  'intend,'  'likely,'  'may,'  'might,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'predict,'  'project,' 'seek,'  'should,'  'target,'  'will,'  'would,'  or  similar  expressions  and  the  negativ es  of  those  terms.  Such  forward-looking  statements  inv olv e  risks  and uncertainties  that  may  cause  actual  ev ents,  results,  or  performance  to  differ  materially  from  those  indicated  by  such  statements,  including,  without limitation, the factors set forth in the section titled 'Item 1A-Risk Factors', and other factors noted in the section titled 'Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1-Business\n\nCostco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  (Costco  or  the  Company)  began  operations  in  1983,  in  Seattle,  Washington.  We  are  principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Australia,  T aiwan,  China,  Spain,  France,  Iceland,  New  Z ealand,  and  Sweden.  Costco  operated  890,  861,  and  838  warehouses  worldwide  at September 1, 2024, September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol 'COST.'\n\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (fiv e weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). T he material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2024 and 2022 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended September 1, 2024, and August 28, 2022. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.\n\n## General\n\nWe operate  membership  warehouses  and  e-commerce  sites  based  on  the  concept  that  offering  our  members  low  prices  on  a  limited  selection  of nationally-branded and priv ate-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales v olumes and rapid inv entory turnov er. When combined with  the  operating  efficiencies  achiev ed  by  v olume  purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-serv ice warehouse facilities, these v olumes and turnov er enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inv entory before we are required to pay for it, ev en while taking adv antage of early payment discounts.\n\nWe buy most of our merchandise directly from suppliers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots  receiv e  large  shipments  from  suppliers  and  quickly  ship  these  goods  to  warehouses.  T his  process  creates  freight  v olume  and  handling efficiencies,  lowering  costs  associated  with  traditional  multiple-step  distribution  channels.  Our  e-commerce  operations  ship  merchandise through our depots and logistics operations, as well as through drop-ship and other deliv ery arrangements with our suppliers.",

In contrast, MDLZ maintained a consistent 5-year Expected Life assumption for its stock-based compensation across 2019\u20132021, even as its risk-free interest rate declined from 2.46% in 2019 to 1.34% in 2020 (from MDLZ's evidence).

In contrast, MO recognized an actual amortization expense of $10 million for post-retirement benefits during the same period. This comparison suggests that MO's pension liability amortization is more mature or better funded relative to PM\u2019s, which may reflect differences in liability structuring, funding levels, or actuarial assumptions between the two companies.",

Similarly, MDLZ experienced unfavorable currency translation impacts of $1,096 million, primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Argentinean peso and other currencies. Both companies experienced negative foreign exchange effects, but PG's Latin America-driven growth (8% pricing contribution) was more resilient in the face of FX headwinds compared to MDLZ's broader regional exposure.",

Mix had a neutral impact on net sales growth. The increase in unit volume was due to growth in IMEA and Latin America (both due to innovation), partially offset by decline in Europe (due to increased pricing). Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 9% driven by an approximately 40% growth in Latin America and high single-digit growth in Europe, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in North America. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 0.5 points.\n\nNet earnings increased 1% to $1.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by a 60 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin declined as an increase in gross margin was more than fully offset by an increase in SG &amp;A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was driven by higher pricing and productivity savings, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and unfavorable mix due to the growth of premium innovation that has lower than segment-average gross margins. SG &amp;A as a percentage of net sales increased due to an increase in marketing spending, partially offset by the positive scale effects of the net sales increase.\n\n## HEALTH CARE\n\n",

These  include  but  are  not  limited  to  incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.\n\nCorporate net sales decreased $164 million to $601 million due to a decrease in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $1.0 billion due to a loss of $1.4 billion due primarily to the impairment charge of the G illette intangible asset and incremental restructuring charges.\n\n## Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost Savings\n\nThe Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of $250 to $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced an incremental limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs of $659 million, which include foreign currency translation losses recognized as a non-cash charge of approximately $216 million due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Restructuring accruals of $166 million as of June 30, 2024, are classified as current liabilities. Ex cluding the non-cash charges of foreign currency translation losses for certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria,  approximately  64%  of  the  restructuring  charges  incurred  in  fiscal  2024  either  have  been  or  will  be  settled  with  cash.  Consistent  with  our  policies  for restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.\n\nSavings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.\n\n## CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.\n\nOperating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.",

      "question": "How did the regional volume/mix dynamics affecting MDLZ's gum and candy categories during the pandemic compare with PM's cigarette volume trends in Russia and Ukraine, and what might this imply about consumer behavior shifts in those markets?",
      "answer": "MDLZ experienced unfavorable volume/mix in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and AMEA, with gum and candy categories negatively impacted by the pandemic as traditional trade faced disruptions. In contrast, PM reported lower cigarette volume in Russia and Ukraine, which was partly offset by higher heated tobacco unit volume in those regions. This suggests that while both companies faced consumption declines in certain categories, PM's shift toward alternative tobacco products in Russia and Ukraine may indicate a more adaptive consumer behavior pattern compared to MDLZ's more rigid gum and candy demand. The contrast highlights differing responses to pandemic-driven market pressures across product categories and geographies.",

Net revenues were higher in developed markets, particularly North America, where due to the COVID-19 outbreak and response, demand for our products, primarily biscuits and chocolate, grew significantly as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption. However, our gum and candy categories as well as our world travel retail and foodservice businesses were negatively impacted by COVID-19. In emerging markets, where we have a greater concentration of traditional trade, several markets were challenged by COVID-19 impacts, particularly those with significant gum and candy portfolios. Overall, as the negative impacts of COVID-19 experienced in the first half of the year subsided in the second half of the year, revenue growth began to recover in a number of our key emerging markets, though overall emerging markets net revenues declined due to unfavorable currency impacts.\n\nOrganic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions except Europe was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2019 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2020. Favorable volume/mix in North America and Europe, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA, included strong volume gains tempered by unfavorable mix reflecting shifts in consumer purchases in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added incremental net revenues of $55 million in 2020. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $637 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Mexican peso, Indian rupee, South African rand and Turkish lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Philippine peso, British pound sterling, Egyptian pound and Swedish krona. The impact of the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million.

Organic sales increased high single digits in G rooming, mid-single digits in Fabric &amp; Home Care and Health Care and low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care.\n- Operating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion related to the Gillette intangible asset.\n- Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax  rate. Foreign ex change impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million.\n- Net earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n- Diluted EPS increased 2% to $6.02 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the G illette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring charges, increased 12% to $6.59.\n- Cash flow from operating activities was $19.8 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital ex penditures and certain other impacts, was $16.9 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the G illette intangible asset impairment charge and a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105%.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola maintained a consistent 3.75% rate of compensation increase across 2021 to 2023, indicating a stable long-term compensation strategy. In contrast, Philip Morris reported a 2.05% rate of compensation increase in 2023, which is significantly lower than Coca-Cola\u2019s rate and suggests a more restrained approach to employee compensation growth. This difference may reflect divergent strategic priorities or cost management approaches between the two companies in their pension and benefit planning.",

      "question": "How did MDLZ's 2023 price increases, driven by rising commodity costs, contribute to a 3% industry-wide sales growth metric, and how did this pricing trend negatively impact PEP's ability to maintain sales in the same period?",
      "answer": "MDLZ's 2023 price increases were a direct response to significant input cost pressures from volatile commodity prices, including cocoa, dairy, and packaging materials. According to MDLZ's 10-K, these price increases were necessary to offset inflation and higher input, packaging, and transportation costs. The DHR 10-K confirms that price increases across the industry contributed 3.0% to year-over-year sales growth. However, PEP's 10-K highlights that commodity inflation and pricing pressure made it difficult to grow or maintain sales, as consumers faced higher prices across the sector. This pricing trend created a challenging environment for PEP, where they risked losing category share or needing to increase marketing expenditures to retain consumers.",

        "Hop 3: Sales Growth \u2190 PEP: PEP's 2023 10-K notes that pricing pressure, including from commodity inflation, negatively impacted their ability to grow or maintain sales and category share."

Target includes beauty and personal care within its second merchandise segment, positioned alongside baby gear and cleaning supplies, suggesting a broad consumer essentials grouping. Unlike P&G's focused product innovation and brand management strategy, Target's approach integrates beauty into a wider retail ecosystem, emphasizing accessibility and in-store experience. This contrast highlights how P&G's measured growth in beauty reflects brand and market maturity, while Target's positioning suggests a retail strategy that leverages beauty as part of a diversified consumer goods portfolio to enhance customer traffic and basket size.",

(e)\n\nMerchandise sales - We record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store. Total revenues do not include sales tax because  we  are  a  pass-through  conduit  for  collecting  and  remitting  sales  taxes.  Generally,  guests  may  return  national  brand merchandise within 90 days of purchase and owned and exclusive brands within one year of purchase. Sales are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns and our expectation of future returns. As of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, the liability for estimated returns was $165 million and $139 million, respectively.\n\nWe routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Under the vast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record revenue and related costs gross. We concluded that we are the principal in these transactions for a number of reasons, most notably because we 1) control the overall economics of the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide goods to the customer. Merchandise received under these arrangements is not included in Inventory because the purchase and sale of this inventory are virtually simultaneous.\n\nRevenue from Target gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of issuance. Our gift cards  do  not  expire.  Based  on  historical  redemption  rates,  a  small  and  relatively  stable  percentage  of  gift  cards  will  never  be redeemed,  referred  to  as  \"breakage.\"  Estimated  breakage  revenue  is  recognized  over  time  in  proportion  to  actual  gift  card redemptions.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did foreign exchange movements in 2023 impact both Procter & Gamble's deferred tax assets and Colgate-Palmolive's total company net sales growth, considering the distinct ways each firm experienced currency-related financial effects?",
      "answer": "In 2023, foreign exchange movements impacted Procter & Gamble's deferred tax assets, as seen in their $149 million deferred tax asset related to foreign exchange at year-end, compared to a $175 million deferred tax liability in the prior year. This shift reflects a reversal of FX-related tax liabilities into assets. For Colgate-Palmolive, foreign exchange had a negative 4.5% impact on total company net sales growth, reducing reported GAAP sales growth to 3.0% despite strong organic growth of 7.0%. These effects show how FX volatility created both asset/liability revaluations and top-line reporting distortions for global consumer goods firms with different regional exposures.",

        "Hop 1: Procter & Gamble \u2192 Foreign Exchange: Procter & Gamble disclosed a $149 million deferred tax asset related to foreign exchange in 2023, compared to a $175 million deferred tax liability in 2022, indicating significant FX-related tax position changes.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's BEAUTY segment net earnings declined from $3,178 million in 2023 to $2,963 million in 2024, a decrease of $215 million. In contrast, Mondel\u0113z International reported net earnings of $4,968 million in 2023, significantly higher than P&G\u2019s BEAUTY segment earnings in that year. This suggests that while P&G\u2019s BEAUTY business experienced a contraction in profitability, Mondel\u0113z maintained a higher and more stable net earnings figure, indicating divergent profitability trends between the two companies\u2019 respective consumer-focused segments.",

      "answer": "In 2021, higher raw material costs negatively impacted MDLZ's segment operating income, partially offsetting gains from productivity, pricing, and volume/mix improvements. For CL's Hill's Pet Nutrition, higher raw and packaging material costs reduced gross profit margin by 300 basis points in 2021, despite offsetting benefits from pricing and cost savings initiatives.

Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net.

Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

Organic sales in Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 13.5% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by the United States and Europe.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was due to organic sales growth in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.\n\nOperating profit in Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 14% in 2021 to $901, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 30 bps to 27.2%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (40 bps) and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (300 bps), partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (100 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (110 bps), partially offset by lower overhead expenses (80 bps). This decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to the portion of costs incurred in 2020 in connection with the voluntary recall of selected canned dog food products due to potentially elevated levels of Vitamin D resulting from a supplier error for which Hill's was not indemnified.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MDLZ experienced a $35 million reduction in net revenues due to divestitures, which negatively impacted their revenue stream. Meanwhile, PM saw a favorable pricing variance driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing, contributing to an 11.2% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions. While combustible tobacco pricing positively impacted PM's net revenues, MDLZ's exposure to similar market dynamics was overshadowed by the negative revenue impact from divestitures, highlighting divergent outcomes in how each company's net revenues were shaped by pricing and portfolio changes.",
