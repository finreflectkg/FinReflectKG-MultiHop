      "question": "How does the $5,772 million in Total Contract and Other Deferred Assets reported under GE's Power segment compare to CAT's exposure in the same market, based on their respective 2022 financial data?",
      "answer": "GE's Power segment reported $5,772 million in Total Contract and Other Deferred Assets as of December 31, 2022, reflecting long-term customer agreements and deferred revenue. In contrast, CAT's Power segment reported only $642 million in Total Finance Receivables for the same period, indicating a significantly smaller exposure in this market. This suggests that GE has a much larger financial commitment and reliance on long-term contracts in the Power sector compared to CAT.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE \u2192 Total Contract and Other Deferred Assets: GE's Power segment reports $5,772 million in deferred assets, indicating substantial long-term customer obligations.",
        "Hop 2: Total Contract and Other Deferred Assets \u2192 Power: This metric is directly tied to the Power segment\u2019s financial structure and long-term service agreements.",
        "Hop 3: Power \u2190 CAT: CAT also operates in the Power segment but shows only $642 million in Total Finance Receivables, suggesting a smaller scale of deferred revenue or contract-based assets."

      "answer": "CAT's Resource Industries segment reported a depreciation expense of $403 million in 2022, which contributed to its overall cost base. Despite this, the segment generated a profit of $1,291 million, indicating strong operational performance relative to its costs. In contrast, LMT faces profit volatility risks due to its reliance on fixed-price contracts, where cost overruns can reduce profitability, and cost-reimbursable contracts, which are subject to funding ceilings and performance-based incentives. This suggests that while CAT's Resource Industries enjoys a more stable asset cost recovery and profitability, LMT's profit is more exposed to contract execution and external funding risks.",

(a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

      "answer": "The exit from PFAS manufacturing led GD to record a goodwill impairment charge related to its Advanced Materials segment, which was part of MMM's Transportation and Electronics business. In 2023, MMM's Transportation and Electronics segment reported an organic sales decline of 3.5%, reflecting the impact of strategic exits, including the removal of manufactured PFAS products. This decline was partially offset by a 0.7% contribution from acquisitions. The impairment and sales performance indicate that the PFAS exit strategy significantly affected both companies, with GD absorbing the direct impairment cost and MMM experiencing reduced organic growth.",

In contrast, Boeing (BA) faced significant profitability pressures due to disruptions in its Commercial Airplanes segment, including delays in 737 MAX and 787 deliveries, supplier production issues, and regulatory challenges. These disruptions led to customer compensation liabilities, delivery suspensions, and production rework, all of which negatively impacted BA's ability to generate stable profits.

Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\n\nWe  derive  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  from  a  limited  number  of  commercial  airlines. We  can  make  no assurance  that  any  customer  will  exercise  purchase  options,  fulfill  existing  purchase  commitments  or  purchase additional  products  or  services  from  us.  In  addition,  fleet  decisions,  airline  consolidations  or  financial  challenges involving  any  of  our  major  commercial  airline  customers  could  significantly  reduce  our  revenues  and  limit  our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n\nOur Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specification, achieve planned production rate  targets,  successfully  develop  new  aircraft  or  new  derivative  aircraft,  and  meet  or  exceed  stringent performance and reliability standards.\n\nThe commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S.  suppliers,  highly-skilled  labor  from  thousands  of  employees  and  other  partners,  and  stringent  regulatory requirements,  including  the  risk  of  evolving  standards  for  commercial  aircraft  certification,  and  performance  and reliability standards. The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the implementation of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, among them changing the process for certification of commercial aircraft. Comparable agencies that regulate similar matters in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or other similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. The 737 program experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of commercial operations of the 737 MAX aircraft by civil aviation  authorities around the globe. 737 MAX deliveries resumed in late 2020 and early 2021 upon approval of the FAA and other nonU.S. civil aviation authorities. During 2020 and 2021, we experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries, including a pause in 787 deliveries since May 2021. During 2021, this  resulted  in  reprioritizing  production  resources  to  support  inspections  and  rework.  We  continue  to  conduct inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries as well as rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the  contractual  delivery  date.  The  regulators  will  ultimately  determine  the  timing  and  conditions  for  resuming  787 deliveries. Delays on the 737 MAX, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\n\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to  adjust  production  rates  on  several  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs.  During  2021,  we  reprioritized  production resources to support inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft. The 787 program is currently producing at very low rates and expects that to continue until deliveries resume. We are also continuing to implement changes in the production  process  designed  to  ensure  that  newly-built  airplanes  meet  our  specifications  and  do  not  require  further inspections  and  rework.  In  addition,  we  continue  to  seek  opportunities  to  reduce  the  costs  of  building  our  aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory.

MMM reported a 0.6% positive impact from divestitures on its total sales change in 2024.

Meanwhile, LMT's cost of sales for products was 92.5% of product sales in 2024, up from 89.2% in 2023, indicating rising cost pressures in the aerospace sector. This suggests that both companies are experiencing elevated cost of sales growth relative to revenue, likely driven by similar production and supply chain dynamics in the defense and aerospace industries.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nunits (such as engines or certain aerospace components), or spans multiple phases of the product life-cycle such as production, maintenance, and support. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost-plus-a-margin approach.\n\nWe  consider  the  contractual  consideration  payable  by  the  customer  and  assess  variable  consideration  that  may  affect  the  total  transaction  price,  including contractual  discounts,  contract  incentive  payments,  estimates  of  award  fees,  flight  hours,  aircraft  landings  or  other  customer  usage  activities  on  long-term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. We account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of revenue. Consideration payable to a customer may include cash amounts we are obligated to pay or expect to pay a customer, as well as credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owed to us. In our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses, we may offer customer incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers.\n\nWhen reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not.\n\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point-in-time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point-in-time sales.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts.\n\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our Raytheon segment, and to a lesser extent Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-ofcompletion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors' costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance, and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using costs incurred to date",

      "answer": "CAT reported an operating profit margin of 20.7% in 2024 under its adjusted results, while Raytheon, as a segment of RTX, had an operating profit margin of 9.0% in 2023. The significant difference in margins suggests that CAT maintains stronger cost control relative to its revenue base. Furthermore, Raytheon's lower margin aligns with RTX's explanation that R&D spending in 2024 was driven by increased investment at Collins and Pratt & Whitney, with Raytheon experiencing reduced R&D expenses, indicating a more conservative innovation strategy for Raytheon compared to the other segments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT \u2192 Operating Profit Margin: CAT's adjusted operating profit margin was 20.7% in 2024, indicating strong profitability relative to revenue.",

        "Hop 3: Raytheon \u2190 RTX: RTX noted that in 2024, R&D spending increased overall, but Raytheon saw reduced R&D expenses compared to other segments, suggesting a more restrained approach to innovation."

      "question": "How does the negative $3,884 million current contract asset in GE's Aerospace segment compare to Lockheed Martin's exposure to contract accounting risks, given both companies' reliance on government contracts in the aerospace sector?",
      "answer": "GE's Aerospace segment reported a negative current contract asset of $3,884 million as of December 31, 2022, indicating that the company had billed more than it had recognized in revenues under certain contracts. This contrasts with Lockheed Martin's exposure to contract accounting risks, which are driven by the U.S. Government's ability to unilaterally definitize contracts and impose burdensome terms, potentially affecting expected profit and cash flows. Given that both companies operate in the aerospace sector and rely heavily on government contracts, GE's financial position on contract assets highlights a different risk profile in contract execution compared to LMT's regulatory and contract definitization risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Aerospace: Lockheed Martin operates in the Aerospace segment and is subject to unique contract accounting practices and risks tied to government contracts, including unilateral definitization that can impact profit and cash flows.",
        "Hop 2: Aerospace \u2192 Curr Contract Assets: The financial performance of aerospace companies like GE in this sector is reflected in contract accounting metrics such as current contract assets, which show the balance of revenues versus billings.",
        "Hop 3: Curr Contract Assets \u2190 GE: GE's Aerospace segment reported a negative current contract asset of $3,884 million as of December 31, 2022, indicating a significant billing-in-advance position relative to revenue recognition."

Meanwhile, RTX's defense backlog rose from $78 billion in 2023 to $93 billion in 2024, reflecting a $15 billion increase in contracted obligations.

Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts as discussed further below.\n\nWe believe bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense businesses. Our defense operations consist primarily of our Raytheon business and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $61 billion, $51 billion, and $47 billion for 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.\n\nDefense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. Defense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). We reflect contract cancellations and terminations, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. Contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on cost-type programs.\n\n## Collins Aerospace\n\n",

The segment's profit grew by 49% year-over-year, driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. In contrast, GE reported a 15.0% profit margin in 2023, with profit growth of $11.0 billion, largely driven by gains on retained and sold ownership interests and improved segment performance.

      "answer": "Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies segment derived 57% of its sales from non-U.S. manufactured products and services in 2021, indicating a significant international footprint. This segment includes Advanced Materials, which produces high-performance products such as materials for bullet-resistant armor, nylon, and computer chips. Similarly, 3M has a reporting unit explicitly named Advanced Materials, which is among the top ten reporting units accounting for approximately 94% of 3M's goodwill, highlighting its strategic importance. While both companies have a global reach and focus on advanced materials, Honeywell's international exposure in this segment is quantifiably high, and 3M's stake in its Advanced Materials unit underscores its internal strategic value within a broader, integrated enterprise.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nto the separate fourth quarter 2021 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2021, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2021, 3M had 22 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 94 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.\n\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M's businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M's focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M's value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\n\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2022 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\n## Uncertainty in Income Tax Positions:\n\nThe extent of 3M's operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company's current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n## NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nThe strength and stability of 3M's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provides financial flexibility and enables the Company to invest through business cycles. Investing in 3M's business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The company's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M's commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2021, there was no commercial paper issued and outstanding.\n\n## Total Debt:\n\nThe strength of 3M's credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company's debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody's Investors Service and an A+ credit rating with negative outlook from Standard and Poor's.",

      "question": "How does Caterpillar's residual value estimation methodology for leased equipment, which considers the 'term' of the lease, compare with Honeywell's use of 'expected term' in valuing stock options, given that the industry average 'expected term' for such financial instruments has decreased from 4.0 to 3.4 years between fiscal years 2020 and 2022?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar estimates residual values for leased equipment by considering factors such as the lease term, expected usage, market trends, and customer purchase options, adjusting depreciation or finance revenue accordingly. Honeywell, on the other hand, uses the 'expected term'\u2014derived from a Monte Carlo simulation and historical data\u2014to estimate how long stock options will remain outstanding, which directly affects their fair value calculation. The industry average expected term for such instruments, as seen in comparable disclosures, decreased from 4.0 years in fiscal 2020 to 3.4 years in fiscal 2022, indicating a broader shift in assumptions about the duration of financial instruments, which impacts both companies' valuation and accounting approaches differently based on their respective asset classes.",

Cat  Financial  leases  to  customers  primarily  through  sales-type  (non-tax)  leases,  where  the  lessee  for  tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the  lease.  For  tax  purposes,  Cat  Financial  is  considered  the  owner  of  the  equipment.  Our  lease  agreements  may  include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fixed price or fair market value.\n\nWe determine the residual value of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value.  We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale  market  sales  prices,  past  remarketing  experience  and  any  known  significant  market/product  trends.    We  also consider  the  following  critical  factors  in  our  residual  value  estimates:  lease  term,  market  size  and  demand,  total  expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nDuring  the  term  of  our  leases,  we  monitor  residual  values.    For  operating  leases,  we  record  adjustments  to  depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\n\nSee Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\n\nThe carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:\n\n",

(2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25, 2016. At December 31, 2021, there were 32,337,638, and 815,299 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively.\n\n## STOCK OPTIONS\n\nThe exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under the Company's stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of the Company's stock on that date. The fair  value  is  recognized  as  an  expense  over  the  employee's  requisite  service  period  (generally  the  vesting  period  of  the  award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  each  option  award  is  estimated  on  the  date  of  grant  using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.  Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options  are  expected  to  remain  outstanding.  Such  model  uses  historical  data  to  estimate  option  exercise  activity  and  post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n\nThe following table summarizes the impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations from stock options:\n\n",

UPS's U.S. Domestic Package segment saw its operating profit decline from $6,997 million in 2022 to $5,076 million in 2023, while revenue fell from $64,209 million to $59,958 million. This results in a drop in operating profit margin from 10.9% in 2022 to 8.5% in 2023. Meanwhile, Emerson emphasizes its focus on operating profit as a stable indicator of performance, implying a strategy to maintain margin resilience. UPS has not recorded any goodwill impairment charges in the U.S. Domestic Package segment, suggesting no major structural issues affecting profitability, yet the margin contraction indicates operational or demand-side pressures unique to UPS\u2019s domestic delivery business.",

      "answer": "Boeing's 2023 net periodic benefit income of ($527) million reflects pension cost pressures influenced by EROA assumptions. Raytheon's disclosure shows that a 25 basis point change in EROA impacts net periodic benefit income by $133 million, indicating high sensitivity to asset return expectations. Since both companies operate in the same industry with complex pension obligations, similar EROA adjustments could lead to amplified volatility in pension costs for both firms, though Boeing's current negative income position suggests greater near-term exposure to downward EROA revisions.",

      "answer": "CAT's Resource Industries segment reported a depreciation expense of $403 million in 2022, reflecting significant capital investment in that division. Meanwhile, GE reported an increase in profit of $1.6 billion organically for the same year, driven by factors such as higher shop visit volume and cost reductions. The relatively high depreciation for CAT's Resource Industries compared to GE's profit growth suggests that CAT's operations in this segment are more capital-intensive, requiring substantial investment in assets, while GE's improvements in profitability were more attributable to operational efficiencies and service-driven revenue. This comparison highlights differing trends in how each company generates profit\u2014CAT through asset-heavy operations and GE through asset utilization and cost management.",

          "chunk_text": "## For the year ended December 31, 2021, segment revenues were down $0.7 billion (3%) and segment profit was up $1.7 billion.\n\nRPO as of December 31, 2021 increased $11.2 billion (10%) from December 31, 2020, due to increases in both equipment and services. Equipment increased primarily due to an increase in Military orders. Services increased primarily as a result of engines contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service.\n\nRevenues decreased $0.7 billion (3%) organically*. Commercial Engines revenues decreased, due to 233 fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including fewer engine shipments on legacy programs, partially offset by 30 more LEAP units versus the prior year. Commercial Services revenues increased, primarily due to increased shop visit volume, partially offset by lower volume on commercial spare part shipments, as prior year revenues included significant spare part shipments prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Commercial Services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, included a net unfavorable change in estimated profitability of $0.3 billion for its long-term service agreements compared to a net unfavorable change of $1.1 billion for the prior year. Military revenues decreased due to lower services and 130 fewer engine shipments, partially offset by product mix.\n\nProfit increased $1.6 billion organically*, primarily due to increased shop visit volume and the receipt of a payment from a partner associated with engine program activity. Profit also increased due to lower net unfavorable changes in estimated profitability in longterm service agreements, as the prior year included charges reflecting the cumulative COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts of changes to billing and cost assumptions for certain long-term service agreements; operational cost reduction from the actions taken in 2020 and the first half of 2021; and the nonrecurrence of prior year charges related to lower commercial engine production volumes, customer credit risk and an impairment charge in a joint venture in the Systems business. These increases in profit were partially offset by an accrual for a contract in a loss position in the long-term service agreement portfolio.\n\nHEALTHCARE. Healthcare provides essential healthcare technologies to developed and emerging markets and has expertise in medical imaging, digital solutions, patient monitoring and diagnostics, drug discovery and performance improvement solutions that are the building blocks of precision health. Products and services are sold worldwide primarily to hospitals and medical facilities.\n\nHealthcare Systems (HCS) - develops, manufactures, markets and services a broad suite of products and solutions used in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients that is encompassed in imaging, ultrasound, life care solutions and enterprise software and solutions. Imaging includes magnetic resonance, computed tomography, molecular imaging, x-ray systems and complementary software and services, for use in general diagnostics, women's health and image-guided therapies.

It delivered products, services and manufacturing solutions for drug discovery, biopharmaceutical production, and cellular and gene therapy technologies.\n\nCompetition &amp; Regulation. Healthcare competes with a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers and services providers. Customers require products and services that allow them to provide better access to healthcare, improve the affordability of care and improve the quality of patient outcomes. Key factors affecting competition include technological innovations, productivity solutions, competitive pricing and the ability to provide lifecycle services. New technologies and solutions could make our products and services obsolete unless we continue to develop new and improved offerings. Our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, as well as laws and regulations that apply to various reimbursement systems or other government funded healthcare programs.\n\nSignificant Trends &amp; Developments. We continue to see an overall recovery in hospital spending; the expectation is that this will continue in line with the worldwide COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Both HCS and PDx demand has recovered to at or above pre-pandemic levels. Similar to many industries, we are experiencing inflation in our supply chain as well as delays in sourcing key materials needed for our products, such as electronics and resins, delaying our ability to convert RPO to revenue. We have proactively managed sourcing and logistics, material and design costs to partially mitigate supply chain impacts. In response to near-term volatility and cost pressures, we have continued to execute on structural cost reductions and cash optimization actions, in order to invest in growth and research and development.\n\nWe continue to grow and invest in precision health, with focus on creating new products and digital solutions as well as expanding uses of existing offerings that are tailored to the different needs of our global customers. We introduced the Vscan Air in over 70 countries, a cutting edge wireless pocket-sized ultrasound that is differentiated by its crystal clear image quality, whole-body scanning capabilities, and intuitive software. We continue to see the broader application of our AIR Recon DL technology, which provides best in class image quality as well as substantially reduced scan time. An example of a new product that includes AIR Recon DL is the SIGNA Hero magnetic resonance imaging system that helps accommodate more patients of all shapes and sizes, offering a 70 cm bore and detachable table for enhanced patient comfort. We introduced the Revolution APEX CT, which has a modular and scalable design to do in-room upgrades on the detector without swapping the gantry, giving customers the flexibility to right size their purchase today and be ready for the future. We remain committed to innovate and invest to create more integrated, efficient, and personalized precision healthcare.",

Caterpillar management utilizes  these  charts  internally  to  visually  communicate  with  the  company's  Board  of  Directors  and  employees.  The  bar  entitled  Other  includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation other operating (income) expenses .\n\nOperating profit was $6.878 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.325 billion, or 51 percent, compared with $4.553 billion in 2020. The increase was due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization, higher profit from Financial Products and lower restructuring expenses (included in other), partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable  manufacturing  costs reflected increased freight and higher material costs. In addition, unfavorable period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, and higher labor costs. Unfavorable period manufacturing costs were mostly offset by favorable cost absorption and lower warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased more during 2021 than during 2020.\n\nHigher  SG&amp;A/R&amp;D  expenses  reflected  higher  short-term  incentive  compensation  expense  and  investments  aligned  with  the company's strategy for profitable growth, including higher labor costs and acquisition-related expenses.\n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to no short-term incentive compensation expense recognized in 2020. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. For 2022, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $1.0 billion.\n\nOperating profit margin was 13.5 percent in 2021, compared with 10.9 percent in 2020.\n\n",

      "question": "How might the $4.2 billion in postretirement liabilities allocated to GE Aerospace impact its strategic flexibility compared to CAT's exposure to similar risks through its defined benefit pension plans?",
      "answer": "The $4.2 billion in postretirement liabilities allocated to GE Aerospace could constrain its strategic flexibility due to the significant financial burden associated with legacy obligations. These liabilities, which were legally split from GE as part of its restructuring, include portions of principal pension plans and retiree benefit plans. In contrast, CAT faces similar exposure through its defined benefit pension plans, which rely heavily on actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, and healthcare trend rates. These assumptions can significantly impact financial statements if actual results differ from projections. While both companies face risks tied to postretirement benefits, GE Aerospace's specific liability transfer highlights a more concentrated exposure that may influence its ability to invest in growth opportunities or respond to market changes compared to CAT's broader, assumption-driven approach.",

        "Hop 1: CAT \u2192 Postretirement Benefit Plans: CAT sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans globally, with actuarial assumptions such as discount rates and expected returns significantly impacting financial outcomes.",

        "Hop 3: GE Aerospace \u2190 GE: GE's restructuring resulted in GE Aerospace being allocated significant postretirement liabilities, which remain on GE's balance sheet until the planned GE Vernova spin-off, affecting its strategic flexibility."

      "answer": "LMT reported $838 million in third-party guarantees as of December 31, 2021, with 69% tied to joint venture performance obligations, indicating significant exposure to long-term contractual risks. In contrast, CAT's Construction Industries segment saw a 25% profit increase from $630 million to $788 million in Q4 2021, suggesting strong performance in a segment that also likely involves long-duration contracts. CAT\u2019s depreciation and amortization in Construction Industries was $237 million in 2021, reflecting capital intensity and long-term asset commitments. These figures imply that while both companies engage in extended contractual obligations, LMT faces higher contingent liabilities tied to joint ventures, whereas CAT's risk is more embedded in asset-heavy, owned operations with visible depreciation patterns.",

          "chunk_text": "\nApproximately $781 million of standby letters of credit in the 'Less Than 1 Year' category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. (a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

      "answer": "MMM's Safety and Industrial segment operating income margins increased year-on-year in 2024, driven by growth, productivity, and spending discipline, despite dis-synergies from the Solventum spin-off. The segment reported flat sales in U.S. dollars but saw margin expansion through internal operational improvements. In contrast, UPS implemented a 5.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates in December 2024 to address declining volumes from its largest customer, which is expected to reduce average daily volume by approximately 8.5% in 2025.

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

As previously disclosed, we expect average daily volume to decline by approximately 8.5% in 2025 as we execute on our plans to accelerate the volume reductions from our largest customer. We expect these volume decreases will be more pronounced during the second half of 2025 as planned volume reductions increase.\n\nBusiness-to-consumer volume increased 3.0% during the year, due primarily to volume from the additional e-commerce customers noted above, and continued growth in online consumer spending.\n\nBusiness-to-business volume decreased 2.6%, primarily due to challenging macroeconomic factors and a slowdown in manufacturing activity which were partially offset by returns volume increases as a result of growth in e-commerce activity.\n\nWithin our Air products, average daily volume decreased 9.1% during the year, driven by continued reductions in air volume from our largest customer as planned, as well as by other customers that made cost trade-offs and utilized the enhanced speed in our ground network. While air volume is expected to decline in 2025 due to our largest customer, these declines are expected to be partially offset by growth from SMB and Enterprise accounts.\n\nGround commercial average daily volume decreased 2.4%, primarily driven by declines across certain large customers and SMBs, partially offset by continued growth within our Digital Access Program. Ground residential average daily volume increased 6.1%, primarily due to an increase in SurePost volume from e-commerce customers. We expect our ground volumes will decrease in 2025 due to the planned volume reductions from our largest customer. We expect that continued growth in SMBs will partially offset these anticipated declines. We expect that our recent pricing actions on our SurePost product may result in SurePost volume declines. The insourcing of our SurePost product does not affect our measurement of average daily volume.\n\n## Revenue Per Piece\n\nRevenue per piece declined 0.5% for the year due primarily to the decrease in fuel surcharges discussed below. The negative impact of changes in product mix, including an increase in lighter weight, shorter zone shipments, were partially offset by the positive impact of pricing actions to address revenue quality, including demand related surcharges, which led to sequential improvement in the revenue per piece growth rate during the second half of the year. In December 2023, we implemented an average 5.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates for both our Air and Ground products. Revenue per piece from our Air products increased due to changes in customer mix while revenue per piece from our Ground products declined due to changes in both customer and product mix.\n\nWe expect revenue per piece to increase during 2025 as we focus on growing higher yielding volume from customers that value our end-to-end integrated network and the impact of an average 5.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates implemented in December 2024.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that adjusts weekly. Our air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy's (\"DOE\") Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type fuel, and our ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE's On-Highway Diesel Fuel price.\n\nIn 2024, fuel surcharge revenue decreased $270 million, driven by reductions in the price per gallon, partially offset by increases in volume and the impact of our pricing initiatives. Based on the anticipated declines in volume, we ex pect fuel surcharge revenue to decrease in 2025.",

      "question": "How might FedEx Ground's 1% increase in average daily volume in 2024 impact its pricing power relative to UPS, considering UPS's reliance on third-party carrier networks for ground freight capacity solutions?",
      "answer": "FedEx Ground experienced a 1% increase in average daily volume in 2024, driven by stronger demand for its commercial and economy services. This volume growth, combined with yield improvement, contributed to a 29% increase in FedEx Ground's operating income. The growth in volume suggests increased network utilization, which can improve cost absorption and potentially support pricing discipline. Meanwhile, UPS relies on a combination of its own fleet and a broad third-party carrier network to deliver ground freight capacity solutions, which may make it more sensitive to market pricing dynamics. If FedEx Ground can maintain volume growth while optimizing its cost structure through initiatives like DRIVE and reduced Sunday deliveries, it could strengthen its pricing position relative to UPS, particularly in the commercial and economy service segments.",

      "question": "How does RTX's disclosed liability for third-party guarantees in 2021 compare in magnitude to the year-over-year increase in UNP's freight revenues from bulk shipments, and what might this suggest about the relative financial exposure of these obligations?",
      "answer": "RTX disclosed a $5 million liability for third-party guarantees in 2021, while UNP experienced a freight revenue increase of $1,993 million (from $18,251 million in 2020 to $20,244 million in 2021) for bulk shipments alone. The significantly larger increase in UNP's freight revenues contrasts sharply with RTX's relatively small liability exposure, suggesting that operational revenue fluctuations in the freight industry can dwarf guarantee-related liabilities on an absolute scale.",

          "chunk_text": "Bulk -  Bulk  includes  shipments  of  grain  and  grain  products, fertilizer, food and refrigerated goods, and coal and renewables. Freight  revenues  from  bulk  shipments  increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to a 5% volume increase, core pricing  gains,  higher  fuel  surcharge  revenue,  and  positive business mix. Despite weather disruptions in the first quarter of 2021,  volume  increased  with  strong  demand  for  grain  in  the first half of the year and coal in the second half, due to higher natural  gas  prices.  In  addition,  strength  in  the  export  potash market and recovery from the COVID pandemic that negatively impacted production of imported beer, food products, and the demand for ethanol and related products in 2020 contributed to additional increases in volume.\n\nIndustrial -Industrial includes shipments of industrial chemicals  and  plastics,  metals  and  minerals,  forest  products, and  energy  and  specialized  markets.  Freight  revenues  from industrial shipments increased in 2021 versus 2020 due a 6% increase in volume, core pricing gains, higher fuel surcharge, and positive mix of traffic. Strength from the pandemic recovery overcame the first quarter 2021 losses caused by Winter Storm Uri disruptions in the Gulf Coast, which impacted the industrial chemicals  and  plastics  and  metals  and  minerals  industries. Additionally, forest product shipments increased due to higher demand for cardboard boxes and lumber.\n\n## 2021 Bulk Carloads\n\n2021 Industrial Carloads\n\nPremium -Premium includes shipments of finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers,  both  domestic  and  international.  Freight  revenues from  premium  shipments  increased  11%  in  2021  compared to 2020, despite the weather disruptions in the first quarter of 2021, driven by higher fuel surcharges, core pricing gains, and a 2% volume increase. Automotive shipments of 173 thousand carloads in the second quarter of 2021 were more than double the 79 thousand carloads in the same period in 2020 as North American  manufacturing  plants  suspended  production  due  to the pandemic in that year. This recovery masked the impact to automotive shipments in 2021 due to the on-going shortage of semiconductors.  Excluding  the  second  quarter,  automotive shipments are  down  14%  year-over-year. The  pandemic  also upended the intermodal supply chain as demand for consumer goods remained high. This high demand strained port capacity, chassis availability, truck driver supply, and warehouse receiving capacity. Despite the global supply chain disruptions, intermodal shipments increased 2% in 2021 due to improving economic conditions,  inventory  restocking,  contract  wins,  and continued strength of e-commerce and parcel shipments.\n\n2021 Premium Carloads\n\nMexico Business - Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Revenue from Mexico business was $2.4 billion in 2021, up 13% compared to 2020, driven by a 3% increase in volume and higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and positive mix of traffic. The volume increase was driven by the recovery from the 2020 pandemic and an increase in petroleum and grain shipments, partially offset by the impact of the global supply chain disruptions on intermodal shipments and the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\n",

FedEx's 2020 consolidated revenue was $5,868 million, with its largest segment, FedEx Express, contributing $3,560 million or about 60.7% of the total.

This segment contributes to EMR's overall backlog, which rose from $7,773 million to $8,448 million year-over-year. In contrast, RTX's defense bookings \u2014 a key forward-looking metric for their defense segment \u2014 surged from $51 billion in 2023 to $61 billion in 2024, indicating a significant increase of $10 billion. This suggests that while EMR's growth in Intelligent Devices is relatively stable and incremental, RTX is experiencing a much stronger growth trajectory in its defense business driven by new contract awards.

Our defense operations consist primarily of our Raytheon business and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $61 billion, $51 billion, and $47 billion for 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.\n\nDefense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated.

      "question": "How does RTX's $491 million allowance for credit losses, driven by Pratt & Whitney's customer bankruptcy, contrast with the risk exposure implied by CAT's significantly higher inter-segment sales of $4,766 million?",
      "answer": "RTX recorded a $491 million allowance for credit losses in 2024, primarily due to a customer bankruptcy at Pratt & Whitney, highlighting credit risk in its external contract receivables. Pratt & Whitney's inter-segment sales were only $2 million in 2024, indicating minimal internal dependency and concentrated external credit exposure. In contrast, CAT reported $4,766 million in inter-segment sales for 2024, suggesting a much higher degree of internal transactions, which may reduce credit risk by limiting exposure to external customers. This contrast implies that RTX's risk profile is more sensitive to external defaults, while CAT's internal sales structure may provide more financial insulation.",

In contrast, Honeywell integrates Advanced Materials as part of its broader Performance Materials and Technologies segment, which also includes Process Solutions and UOP. Within this structure, Honeywell emphasizes specific high-performance product lines such as materials used in bullet-resistant armor, computer chips, and low global-warming-potential materials based on hydrofluoro-olefin technology.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nto the separate fourth quarter 2021 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2021, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2021, 3M had 22 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 94 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.\n\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M's businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M's focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M's value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\n\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2022 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\n## Uncertainty in Income Tax Positions:\n\nThe extent of 3M's operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company's current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n## NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nThe strength and stability of 3M's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provides financial flexibility and enables the Company to invest through business cycles. Investing in 3M's business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The company's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M's commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2021, there was no commercial paper issued and outstanding.\n\n## Total Debt:\n\nThe strength of 3M's credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company's debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody's Investors Service and an A+ credit rating with negative outlook from Standard and Poor's.",

      "answer": "The FedEx Ground segment had a capital expenditure of $1,446 million in 2021, which grew by 48% to reach $2,139 million in 2022. In contrast, 3M reported total revenue of $7,204 million in 2021. This suggests that while FedEx was significantly increasing investment in its ground logistics infrastructure, 3M's overall revenue base in 2021 was more than five times larger, indicating different scales and priorities in capital deployment between the logistics and diversified manufacturing sectors.",

Equipment increased primarily due to an increase in Military orders. Services increased primarily as a result of engines contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service.\n\nRevenues decreased $0.7 billion (3%) organically*. Commercial Engines revenues decreased, due to 233 fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including fewer engine shipments on legacy programs, partially offset by 30 more LEAP units versus the prior year. Commercial Services revenues increased, primarily due to increased shop visit volume, partially offset by lower volume on commercial spare part shipments, as prior year revenues included significant spare part shipments prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Commercial Services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, included a net unfavorable change in estimated profitability of $0.3 billion for its long-term service agreements compared to a net unfavorable change of $1.1 billion for the prior year. Military revenues decreased due to lower services and 130 fewer engine shipments, partially offset by product mix.\n\nProfit increased $1.6 billion organically*, primarily due to increased shop visit volume and the receipt of a payment from a partner associated with engine program activity. Profit also increased due to lower net unfavorable changes in estimated profitability in longterm service agreements, as the prior year included charges reflecting the cumulative COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts of changes to billing and cost assumptions for certain long-term service agreements; operational cost reduction from the actions taken in 2020 and the first half of 2021; and the nonrecurrence of prior year charges related to lower commercial engine production volumes, customer credit risk and an impairment charge in a joint venture in the Systems business. These increases in profit were partially offset by an accrual for a contract in a loss position in the long-term service agreement portfolio.\n\nHEALTHCARE.

Healthcare competes with a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers and services providers. Customers require products and services that allow them to provide better access to healthcare, improve the affordability of care and improve the quality of patient outcomes. Key factors affecting competition include technological innovations, productivity solutions, competitive pricing and the ability to provide lifecycle services. New technologies and solutions could make our products and services obsolete unless we continue to develop new and improved offerings. Our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, as well as laws and regulations that apply to various reimbursement systems or other government funded healthcare programs.\n\nSignificant Trends &amp; Developments. We continue to see an overall recovery in hospital spending; the expectation is that this will continue in line with the worldwide COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Both HCS and PDx demand has recovered to at or above pre-pandemic levels. Similar to many industries, we are experiencing inflation in our supply chain as well as delays in sourcing key materials needed for our products, such as electronics and resins, delaying our ability to convert RPO to revenue. We have proactively managed sourcing and logistics, material and design costs to partially mitigate supply chain impacts. In response to near-term volatility and cost pressures, we have continued to execute on structural cost reductions and cash optimization actions, in order to invest in growth and research and development.\n\nWe continue to grow and invest in precision health, with focus on creating new products and digital solutions as well as expanding uses of existing offerings that are tailored to the different needs of our global customers. We introduced the Vscan Air in over 70 countries, a cutting edge wireless pocket-sized ultrasound that is differentiated by its crystal clear image quality, whole-body scanning capabilities, and intuitive software. We continue to see the broader application of our AIR Recon DL technology, which provides best in class image quality as well as substantially reduced scan time. An example of a new product that includes AIR Recon DL is the SIGNA Hero magnetic resonance imaging system that helps accommodate more patients of all shapes and sizes, offering a 70 cm bore and detachable table for enhanced patient comfort. We introduced the Revolution APEX CT, which has a modular and scalable design to do in-room upgrades on the detector without swapping the gantry, giving customers the flexibility to right size their purchase today and be ready for the future. We remain committed to innovate and invest to create more integrated, efficient, and personalized precision healthcare.",

      "answer": "FDX reports that a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease its pension expense by $127 million, while a 50 basis point decrease would increase it by the same amount. This reflects FDX\u2019s sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations through its pension obligations. In contrast, EMR estimates that a 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rates would increase its 2025 pension expense by $15 million, indicating a different sensitivity profile. Additionally, EMR\u2019s U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $800 million as of September 30, 2024, while FDX\u2019s pension funding status is not explicitly stated but implied to be less overfunded given its larger expense volatility.

      "question": "Given GE's projected net periodic benefit income for 2024 and RTX's sensitivity to changes in EROA, how might an analyst estimate RTX's potential net periodic benefit income if it adopted GE's EROA assumption instead of its own, and what would that imply about pension-driven income volatility for industrial defense contractors?",
      "answer": "To estimate RTX's potential net periodic benefit income under GE's EROA assumption, we first note that GE projects its net periodic benefit income for 2024 at $1,235 million. RTX discloses that a 25 basis point change in its EROA would have impacted its 2023 net periodic benefit income by approximately $133 million. Assuming RTX's base EROA and income align closely with 2023 levels, and if RTX adopted GE's EROA assumption (which implies a different long-term expected return), an analyst could proportionally scale RTX\u2019s sensitivity figure to estimate the shift in income. This cross-company assumption shift highlights how pension accounting choices, particularly EROA methodology, can significantly affect reported income and introduces a layer of volatility that investors should consider when evaluating the financial stability of industrial defense firms like RTX.",

In contrast, Caterpillar\u2019s Financial Products Segment reported a profit of $908 million in 2021, up from $590 million in 2020, indicating a $318 million year-over-year increase. Additionally, Caterpillar\u2019s Financial Products Segment recorded depreciation and amortization of $772 million in 2021, suggesting significant asset-related expenses that could impact net profitability.

          "chunk_text": "## For the year ended December 31, 2021, segment revenues were down $0.7 billion (3%) and segment profit was up $1.7 billion.\n\nRPO as of December 31, 2021 increased $11.2 billion (10%) from December 31, 2020, due to increases in both equipment and services. Equipment increased primarily due to an increase in Military orders. Services increased primarily as a result of engines contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service.\n\nRevenues decreased $0.7 billion (3%) organically*. Commercial Engines revenues decreased, due to 233 fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including fewer engine shipments on legacy programs, partially offset by 30 more LEAP units versus the prior year. Commercial Services revenues increased, primarily due to increased shop visit volume, partially offset by lower volume on commercial spare part shipments, as prior year revenues included significant spare part shipments prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Commercial Services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, included a net unfavorable change in estimated profitability of $0.3 billion for its long-term service agreements compared to a net unfavorable change of $1.1 billion for the prior year. Military revenues decreased due to lower services and 130 fewer engine shipments, partially offset by product mix.\n\nProfit increased $1.6 billion organically*, primarily due to increased shop visit volume and the receipt of a payment from a partner associated with engine program activity. Profit also increased due to lower net unfavorable changes in estimated profitability in longterm service agreements, as the prior year included charges reflecting the cumulative COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts of changes to billing and cost assumptions for certain long-term service agreements; operational cost reduction from the actions taken in 2020 and the first half of 2021; and the nonrecurrence of prior year charges related to lower commercial engine production volumes, customer credit risk and an impairment charge in a joint venture in the Systems business. These increases in profit were partially offset by an accrual for a contract in a loss position in the long-term service agreement portfolio.\n\nHEALTHCARE. Healthcare provides essential healthcare technologies to developed and emerging markets and has expertise in medical imaging, digital solutions, patient monitoring and diagnostics, drug discovery and performance improvement solutions that are the building blocks of precision health.

Our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, as well as laws and regulations that apply to various reimbursement systems or other government funded healthcare programs.\n\nSignificant Trends &amp; Developments. We continue to see an overall recovery in hospital spending; the expectation is that this will continue in line with the worldwide COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Both HCS and PDx demand has recovered to at or above pre-pandemic levels. Similar to many industries, we are experiencing inflation in our supply chain as well as delays in sourcing key materials needed for our products, such as electronics and resins, delaying our ability to convert RPO to revenue. We have proactively managed sourcing and logistics, material and design costs to partially mitigate supply chain impacts. In response to near-term volatility and cost pressures, we have continued to execute on structural cost reductions and cash optimization actions, in order to invest in growth and research and development.\n\nWe continue to grow and invest in precision health, with focus on creating new products and digital solutions as well as expanding uses of existing offerings that are tailored to the different needs of our global customers. We introduced the Vscan Air in over 70 countries, a cutting edge wireless pocket-sized ultrasound that is differentiated by its crystal clear image quality, whole-body scanning capabilities, and intuitive software. We continue to see the broader application of our AIR Recon DL technology, which provides best in class image quality as well as substantially reduced scan time. An example of a new product that includes AIR Recon DL is the SIGNA Hero magnetic resonance imaging system that helps accommodate more patients of all shapes and sizes, offering a 70 cm bore and detachable table for enhanced patient comfort. We introduced the Revolution APEX CT, which has a modular and scalable design to do in-room upgrades on the detector without swapping the gantry, giving customers the flexibility to right size their purchase today and be ready for the future. We remain committed to innovate and invest to create more integrated, efficient, and personalized precision healthcare.",

      "answer": "In 2021, CAT's Dealer portfolio segment had $78 million in 91+ days past due finance receivables concentrated in Latin America, which could imply higher credit risk and potentially greater sensitivity to macroeconomic factors like interest rate changes in that region. In contrast, UPS disclosed that the sensitivity of its finance receivables to changes in interest rates was not material as of December 31, 2021, suggesting a more stable or hedged position. This indicates that CAT's Dealer portfolio may have faced more pronounced interest rate and credit risk exposure in 2021 compared to UPS, particularly in Latin America.",

      "answer": "FedEx Ground experienced a 1% increase in average daily volume in 2024, driven by stronger demand for commercial and economy services, which reflects improved network efficiency and customer retention strategies. In contrast, UPS reported volume declines across both residential and commercial segments, with business-to-consumer volume down 9.3% and business-to-business volume down 7.2%, largely due to inflationary pressures, shifts in consumer spending, and disruptions from labor negotiations with the Teamsters. This divergence in volume trends suggests that FedEx may have gained relative market share in the U.S. parcel delivery market during 2024, especially considering UPS anticipated flat to moderate growth in the first half of 2024. The competitive positioning is further shaped by FedEx\u2019s cost-reduction initiatives, including DRIVE and reduced Sunday deliveries, which supported better service reliability and cost control during a period of macroeconomic uncertainty.",

      "question": "How has the growth in RTX's defense backlog from 2023 to 2024 influenced the increase in EMR's Intelligent Devices segment backlog over the same period, and what does this suggest about the demand trajectory for advanced electronics in defense applications?",
      "answer": "RTX's defense backlog grew from $78 billion in 2023 to $93 billion in 2024, reflecting increased bookings for defense contracts. This rise in defense backlog has contributed to a corresponding increase in EMR's Intelligent Devices segment backlog, which rose from $4,471 million in 2023 to $4,491 million in 2024. Given that EMR's Intelligent Devices segment supports applications in defense electronics, the slight but notable growth in its backlog aligns with the rising demand for advanced electronics in defense systems, as evidenced by RTX\u2019s increased defense contract activity.",

Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts as discussed further below.\n\nWe believe bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense businesses. Our defense operations consist primarily of our Raytheon business and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $61 billion, $51 billion, and $47 billion for 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.\n\nDefense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. Defense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). We reflect contract cancellations and terminations, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. Contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on cost-type programs.\n\n## Collins Aerospace\n\n",

      "answer": "GE's non-current contract and other deferred assets for the Power segment were $728 million as of December 31, 2022, while CAT's total customer receivables in the Power segment were $642 million for the same period. This indicates that GE holds a larger deferred financial exposure tied to long-term obligations in the power industry compared to CAT\u2019s more immediate receivables, suggesting differing financial risk profiles in their power operations.",

      "answer": "A 50 basis point decrease in discount rates increases FDX's Pension Benefit Obligation (PBO) by $1,498 million, as shown in FDX's 2023 10-K. This mirrors the pattern seen at UNP, where a smaller 21 basis point decrease in discount rates\u2014from 5.21% to 5.00%\u2014resulted in actuarial losses that increased the PBO in 2023. Thus, both companies experienced a rise in PBO due to declining discount rates, but the magnitude of FDX's modeled 50 basis point impact is significantly larger than UNP's actual 2023 change.",

      "answer": "Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) achieved a 12.9% operating profit margin in 2021, significantly higher than the 9.0% total segment average for RTX in the same year, suggesting that RMD was a strong contributor to RTX's overall profitability. This aligns with Emerson\u2019s view of operating profit margin as a key indicator of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability, as outlined in their 2022 10-K. RTX's broader segment performance, including lower margins from Collins Aerospace Systems (9.5%) and Pratt & Whitney (2.5%), indicates a mixed profitability landscape, making RMD's strong margin particularly strategic. Therefore, RMD's high margin supports RTX\u2019s focus on maintaining and enhancing operational efficiency, a principle also central to Emerson\u2019s financial strategy.",

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. In connection with the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - 'Risk Factors,' which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement the Company's financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain 'non-GAAP financial measures,' as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management's control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the Company's financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nUnderlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure: net sales ).\n\nOperating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings",

      "answer": "Honeywell contributed $12 million to its non-U.S. pension plans in 2023 to meet regulatory funding requirements, indicating a relatively minor funding need for its non-U.S. plans. In contrast, Boeing reported a net periodic pension income of $527 million in 2023, which reflects the broader actuarial assumptions and asset returns in its pension accounting. The sensitivity analysis from RTX shows that a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease net periodic benefit income by $13 million, illustrating how small changes in actuarial assumptions can significantly affect reported pension income. This implies that Boeing's $527 million figure is sensitive to such changes, and a modest shift in discount rates could materially alter its pension income, whereas Honeywell's smaller contribution suggests lower exposure or different funding dynamics in its non-U.S. plans.",

      "answer": "RTX experienced a $6.2 billion organic increase in total cost of sales in 2024, partially driven by its Raytheon segment. EMR\u2019s total cost of sales in 2023 was $2,029 million on total net sales of $3,205 million, yielding a cost-to-sales ratio of approximately 63.3%. Applying this hypothetical efficiency benchmark to RTX\u2019s $6.2 billion cost increase suggests a corresponding sales growth of around $9.8 billion if EMR\u2019s cost efficiency were replicated. However, RTX's cost increase is significantly larger, indicating either higher input costs, lower pricing power, or structural differences in their cost base. This comparison highlights potential differences in cost management strategies or market pressures between the two companies, although direct comparison is limited by differing segment structures and reporting frameworks.",

      "answer": "HON faced pandemic-related liquidity risks that could force it to draw on existing cash balances due to reduced cash flow from operations, as seen in its 2022 10-K filing. In contrast, ME&T benefits from Caterpillar's broader capital structure, which included $9.25 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021. ME&T specifically had access to $2.75 billion in committed credit facilities under Caterpillar's global credit lines, with $825 million available under the 364-day facility, $715 million under the three-year facility, and $1.21 billion under the five-year facility. This structural support, combined with Caterpillar's 'mid-A' debt ratings and support agreement with Cat Financial, provides ME&T with greater liquidity flexibility compared to HON's more constrained position where cash balances might be insufficient to service debt if operating cash flows declined significantly.",

          "chunk_text": "Risks  arising  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  impacting  our  business  and  that  may  continue  to  impact  our  business,  financial condition, results of operations and prospects include, among other things:\n\n- Customer  Risk -Existing  and  potential  customers  and  their  end-users  may  continue  to  take  actions  to  reduce  or  suspend operations,  reduce  or  delay  spending,  cancel  contracts,  or  cut  costs  in  a  manner  that  reduces  demand  for  our  products  and services.  In  particular,  lower  demand  for  air  travel  may  continue  to  cause  our  customers  to  delay  or  suspend  spending  in connection with the manufacturing, repair, overhaul or servicing of aircraft, and there may be long-term deterioration in demand for air travel that could impact our business beyond the current COVID-19 health crisis. Customers may also continue to attempt to  renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, face financial constraints on their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis or at all, or enter into bankruptcy or discontinue their business operations, and we may continue to be required to discount the pricing of our products. In addition, unfavorable customer site conditions, such as closure of or access restrictions to customer facilities,  and  disruptions  to  our  customers'  third-party  logistics,  warehousing,  inventory  management,  and  distribution  services may continue to limit our ability to sell products, meet billing milestones, or provide services.\n- Operations Risk -The closure of our facilities, restrictions inhibiting our employees' ability to access those facilities, materials and labor shortages, and disruptions to the ability of our suppliers or service providers to deliver goods or services to us (including as a result of supplier facility closures or access restrictions, disruptions to their supply chains, and supplier liquidity or bankruptcy risk) could further disrupt our ability to provide our services and solutions and result in, among other things, higher costs which may not be recoverable under customer contracts, claims for liquidated damages in the event of delays, terminations of customer contracts and losses of revenue. Because the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings,  liquidity,  and  cash  flows,  we  have  taken  and  may  be  required  to  redeploy  significant  cost  actions,  including  but  not limited to reducing discretionary expenses (such as non-essential travel, contractors, and consultants), reducing hiring, canceling annual merit increases, reducing executive and board of director pay, reducing work schedules across the enterprise, shortening or staggering work schedules to match production with demand, and reducing staffing levels, as well as increasing supplier-based productivity and enhancing spending-limit controls. However, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not currently ascertainable; also, our costs may not decrease at the same pace as revenue declines as many of our costs are less variable in nature, and we may not be able to or may not choose to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term  outlook  and  growth  opportunities.  Further,  our  management  of  the  impact  of  COVID-19  will  continue  to  require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our global enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments, which may adversely impact our future results of operations. Issues relating to the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  also  result  in  legal  claims  or  litigation  against  us.  In  addition,  remote  work  has  increased  the frequency of cybersecurity attacks, including phishing, and malware attempts that utilize COVID-19-related strategies, increasing the risk of a material cybersecurity incident that could result in the loss of proprietary or personal data, render us more vulnerable to future cybersecurity attacks, disrupt our operations, or otherwise cause us reputational or financial harm.\n- Liquidity and Cash Flow Risk -Because of the customer and operations risks described above, our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may need to use existing cash balances to service our debt, and if such balances are insufficient, then we may be required to engage in one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring of existing debt, issuing new debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.\n\nDue to the changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to curb its spread, we cannot predict the ultimate impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow. Any recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors. In addition, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that may occur in the future. Further, many of the factors disclosed under Risk Factors in this Form 10-K are, and we anticipate will continue to be further, heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the COVID19 pandemic.\n\n## A significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.\n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company's sales. Risks related to international operations  include  exchange  control  regulations,  wage  and  price  controls,  antitrust  regulations,  employment  regulations,  foreign investment  laws,  import,  export  and  other  trade  restrictions  (such  as  sanctions  and  embargoes),  differing  levels  of  protection  of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate such risk), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability  and  uncertainties  arising  from  the  global  geopolitical  environment  and  the  evolving  international  and  domestic political,  regulatory, and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, including sanctions and trade barriers, and trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.",

A downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, ME&amp;T's operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our committed credit facilities. Our Financial Products' operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial, and  potential  borrowings  from  Caterpillar.  In  addition,  we  maintain  a  support  agreement  with  Cat  Financial,  which  requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios.\n\nWe facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs (the 'Programs') through participating financial institutions. The Programs are  available  to  a  wide  range  of  suppliers  and  allows  them  the  option  to  manage  their  cash  flow.  We  are  not  a  party  to  the agreements  between  the  participating  financial  institutions  and  the  suppliers  in  connection  with  the  Programs.  The  range  of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the Programs. The amounts payable to participating financial institutions for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the Programs and included in accounts payable in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position were $822 million and $533 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The amounts settled through the Programs and paid to participating financial institutions were $4.1 billion and $3.2 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We account for payments made under the Programs, the same as our other accounts payable, as a reduction to our cash flows from operations. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.\n\n## Material cash requirements for contractual obligations\n\nWe believe our balances of cash and cash equivalents of $9.25 billion and time deposits of $964 million as of December 31, 2021, along  with  cash  generated  by  ongoing  operations  and  continued  access  to  debt  markets,  will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy  our  cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nWe have committed cash outflow related to postretirement benefit obligations, long-term debt and operating lease agreements. See Notes 12, 14 and 20, respectively, of Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for additional information.\n\nWe have short-term obligations related to the purchase of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. These consist of invoices received and recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2021, but scheduled for payment in 2022 of $8.15 billion. In addition,  we  have  contractual  obligations  for  material  and  services  on  order  at  December  31,  2021,  but  not  yet  invoiced  or delivered, of $7.28 billion.\n\nWe also have long-term contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements; systems support, software licenses and development  contracts;  information  technology  consulting  contracts  and  outsourcing  contracts  for  benefit  plan  administration. These obligations total $1.16 billion, with $550 million due in the next 12 months.\n\n## Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation\n\nNet  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  was  $7.18  billion  in  2021,  compared  with  $4.05  billion  in  2020.  The  increase  was primarily  due  to  higher  profit  in  2021  adjusted  for  non-cash  items,  which  included  higher  accruals  for  short-term  incentive compensation. In addition, lower payments for short-term incentive compensation favorably impacted cash flow. Partially offsetting these items were increased working capital requirements. Within working capital, changes in inventory and accounts receivable unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2021 was $1.23 billion, compared with net cash used of $1.34 billion in 2020. The change was  primarily  due  to  increased  activity  related  to  intercompany  lending  with  Financial  Products,  mostly  offset  by  increased investments in securities. During 2021, we invested $1.19 billion in bank time deposits with varying maturity dates within one year and received proceeds from time deposits that matured of $225 million. We also acquired the Oil &amp; Gas division of the Weir Group PLC for $359 million, net of cash acquired in February 2021.\n\nNet cash used for financing activities during 2021 was $6.30 billion, compared with net cash used of $1.18 billion in 2020. The change was primarily due to the repayment of debt and lower proceeds from the issuance of debt. In addition, we repurchased $2.67 billion of Caterpillar common stock in 2021 compared to $1.13 billion in 2020.",

This compares to RTX's total backlog of $196 billion as of December 31, 2023, which also represents the aggregate value of firm orders for which products have not been delivered or services have not been performed.

In contrast, Caterpillar acknowledges that prolonged economic weakness could lead to increased goodwill and asset impairment charges due to reduced capital expenditures and demand volatility in industries like mining and transportation.

      "answer": "HON defines organic sales growth as excluding the impact of acquisitions (and divestitures) for the first 12 months following a transaction, which means any growth contribution from acquisitions is stripped out to reflect ongoing operations. MMM, in contrast, reports a 0.2% positive contribution from acquisitions in its 2024 net sales change. This means that when comparing HON's organic growth metrics directly to MMM's, MMM's performance includes a small boost from acquisitions, while HON's is purged of such effects. Therefore, without adjusting for this difference in reporting methodology, a direct comparison of their organic growth figures may not be fully apples-to-apples.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Caterpillar's operating profit margin due to international price discounting compare with the operating profit trend in UPS's International Package segment, given the shared exposure to global market pressures?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar notes that international price discounting pressures have negatively impacted its operating profit margin, particularly outside the U.S., where competitors have regional advantages. Meanwhile, UPS's International Package segment saw a decline in operating profit from $4,646 million in 2021 to $3,231 million in 2023, reflecting global market pressures. This indicates that both companies are experiencing margin compression in their international operations, albeit in different sectors\u2014construction equipment and logistics\u2014suggesting a broader trend of global economic headwinds affecting diverse industries.",

      "question": "How does Lockheed Martin's 2024 pre-tax profit of $6,220 million compare with Emerson's ISE & TOD segment's 2024 EBIT of $435 million, and what does this suggest about the relative profitability of their core versus specialized business segments?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin reported Earnings Before Income Taxes of $6,220 million in 2024, reflecting its broad-based defense and aerospace operations. In contrast, Emerson\u2019s ISE & TOD segment, a specialized business unit focused on industrial automation and technology, reported EBIT of $435 million in the same period. This significant difference in pre-tax profitability highlights the scale and margin disparity between Lockheed\u2019s core integrated defense systems and Emerson\u2019s niche industrial solutions, suggesting that Lockheed\u2019s vertically integrated model generates substantially higher returns at the pre-tax level compared to Emerson\u2019s more fragmented segment performance.",

        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Earnings Before Income Taxes: LMT disclosed $6,220 million in EBIT for 2024, showing strong profitability from its integrated defense and aerospace operations.",

      "answer": "GE's net periodic benefit income is sensitive to EROA changes, with a 25 basis point change impacting income by $133 million in 2023. FDX's pension expense similarly responds to EROA fluctuations, with a 50 basis point change resulting in a $127 million effect. The difference in sensitivity magnitude suggests GE may have a larger asset base or different pension structure requiring more frequent actuarial adjustments, while FDX's pension plan appears more stable but with larger single-year exposure to market return assumptions. Both companies demonstrate material exposure to long-term return on plan assets, but with distinct risk profiles.",

      "answer": "Boeing's investment in BDS was $557 million in 2024, and BDS experienced a revenue decline of $1,015 million in 2024 due to unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments on major fixed-price development programs. Lockheed Martin also faces significant risks in its fixed-price development contracts, where cost overruns can lead to reduced margins or reach-forward losses. Given that both companies operate in the aerospace and defense sector and rely heavily on fixed-price contracts, Boeing\u2019s specific financial exposure through BDS highlights a similar vulnerability to Lockheed Martin\u2019s operational and financial risks in managing complex development programs under fixed-price structures.",

When this occurs, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident.\n\nUnder both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected. Costs to complete a contract may increase for many reasons, including technical and manufacturing challenges, schedule delays, workforce-related issues, inaccurate initial contract cost estimates, the timeliness and availability of materials from suppliers, internal and subcontractor performance or product quality issues, inability to meet cost reduction initiatives or achieve efficiencies from digital transformation, changing laws or regulations, inflation and natural disasters. Certain contracts may impose other risks, such as forfeiting fees, paying penalties, or providing replacement systems in the event of performance failure.\n\nContracts for development programs include complex design and technical requirements and are often contracted on a cost-reimbursable basis, however, some of our  existing  development  programs  are  contracted  on  a  fix ed-price  basis.  In  addition,  we  have  certain  contracts  where  we  bid  upfront  on  cost-reimbursable development work and the follow-on fixed-price production options in one submission. We expect we also will bid on similar programs in the future. Fixed-price development work or fixed-price production options, especially on competitively bid programs, is inherently riskier than cost-reimbursable work because the revenue is  fix ed,  while  the  estim ates  of  costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability due to the nature of development programs. The technical complexity coupled with the fixed-price contract structure of certain of our ongoing development programs or new programs increases the risk that our costs will be greater than anticipated, resulting in reduced margins, operating profit, or reach-forward losses during the period of contract performance or upon contract award, all of which could be significant to our financial condition and operating results. Bidding upfront on fixed-price production options increases the risk that we may experience lower margins than expected, or a loss, on the production options because we must estimate the cost of producing a product before it has been  developed.  These  risks  may  cause  us  not  to  bid  on  certain  future  programs,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  future  growth  prospects  and  financial performance. See Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about losses incurred on certain programs, including fixed-price development programs.\n\nContracts for the transition from development to production (e.g., low rate initial production (LRIP) contracts) also create performance and financial risks to our business because of the challenge of starting and stabilizing a manufacturing production and test line while concurrently validating final design and managing change in requirements or capabilities requested by the customer.\n\nMany of our contracts include multiple option years exercisable at the customer's discretion, which carries risk. The customer may decline to exercise an option, or the customer may exercise an option on a contract for which we expect to incur a loss or perform at a low margin, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nWe are routinely subject to audit by our customers on government contracts, including audits relating to our disclosed Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) rate structure or any changes to our CAS rate structure and the results of those audits could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations\n\nU.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and various agency Inspectors G eneral, routinely  audit  and  investigate  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  a  contractor's  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  contract  terms, regarding, among other things, contract pricing, contract performance, cost structure and business systems. U.S. G overnment audits and investigations often take years to complete, and many result in no adverse action against us. Like many U.S. G overnment contractors, we have received audit and investigative reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices or that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. Similarly, like other U.S. G overnment contractors, audits and investigations also occur related to cost reimbursements that are based upon our final allowable incurred costs for each year. We have unaudited or unsettled incurred cost claims related to past years, which limits our ability to issue final billings on contracts for which authorized and appropriated funds may be expiring or can result in delays in final billings and our ability to close out a contract. These audits could result in unanticipated changes to contract prices and the amount and timing of payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.\n\nIf  an  audit  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  may  be  subject  to  civil  or  criminal  penalties  and  administrative  sanctions,  including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, penalties, fines or suspension or  debarment from doing business with the U.S. G overnment.  Reductions in the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, penalties, and fines could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in any particular reporting period, and suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence on contracts with the U.S. G overnment. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Similar government oversight and risks to our business and reputation exist in most other countries where we conduct business.",

      "answer": "The $0.3 billion goodwill impairment in 3M's Advanced Materials reporting unit signals financial pressure and a potential reduction in the value of its advanced materials capabilities. This impairment, recorded in December 2022 and resulting in no remaining goodwill for that unit, likely constrained 3M's ability to invest in R&D or maintain competitive advantage in this space. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin has identified advanced materials as one of the technological areas driving new factors of competition, particularly in aerospace and defense applications.

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin operates in the Aerospace segment under U.S. government contracts that heavily regulate billing and revenue recognition, often leading to timing mismatches due to undefinitized contract actions. In contrast, GE's 2022 financial data shows that its Aerospace segment reported $2,363 million in revenues exceeding billings and had $4,318 million in long-term service agreements, indicating a significant deferral of revenue recognition. This implies that GE's Aerospace segment may experience more pronounced cash flow delays tied to long-term contracts compared to Lockheed Martin, whose billing dynamics are shaped more by government contract structures than by commercial service agreements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Aerospace: Lockheed Martin operates in the Aerospace segment, heavily regulated by U.S. government contract laws, including timing mismatches between billings and revenues due to undefinitized contract actions (UCAs).",

In contrast, FDX reported a consolidated revenue of $90.155 billion in 2023, which declined by 3% compared to the prior year. This indicates that while GD's Marine Systems remains a significant and growing contributor to its revenue base, FDX experienced an overall revenue contraction at the consolidated level.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin reported that in 2024, 32% of its Aeronautics segment's net sales came from international customers, with the F-35 program being a key driver due to strong global interest and participation from seven international partner countries and twelve FMS customers. Meanwhile, RTX noted that in 2024, Collins experienced increased customer-funded R&D expenses driven by higher spending on various military programs, including the F-35. This indicates that while Lockheed Martin's international exposure in Aeronautics is significantly shaped by F-35-related sales, RTX's Collins segment is strategically investing in the program's development and sustainment, reflecting different but interconnected dimensions of involvement in the F-35 ecosystem.",

Once the debt ceiling is reached, Treasury may have to use extraordinary measures to prevent default. Treasury's available cash and any extraordinary measures taken should delay the risk of default for at least several months after the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the upcoming months, the new Congress will return to the task of funding the U.S. G overnment for the balance of FY  2025. Significant differences that must be resolved include the different allocations as noted above and policy matters that arose during consideration of the CR and the underlying bills.\n\nWe anticipate the federal budget will continue to be subject to debate and compromise shaped by, among other things, the new Administration and Congress, the global security environment, inflationary pressures, and macroeconomic conditions. The result may be shifting funding priorities, which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and our programs.\n\n## Geopolitical and E conomic E nvironment\n\nWe operate in a complex and evolving global security environment and our business is affected by geopolitical and security issues. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East and heightened tension in the Pacific region have elevated global security concerns resulting in increased interest for our products and services as countries seek to improve their security posture. In this context, the U.S. G overnment, our largest customer, continues to align its budget with the defense priorities set forth in the 2022 National Defense Strategy. In addition, security assistance provided by the U.S. G overnment and its allies to Ukraine has increased  U.S.  G overnment and allied demand to replenish  U.S. stockpiles, resulting in additional and potential future orders, including for the ramp-up in production capacity for certain products. We continue to expect additional orders over the next several years attributable to the global threat environment. We operate primarily in a long-cycle business and the U.S. G overnment has been focused on increasing industry capacity to meet demand. We continue to work with the U.S. Government and our supply chain to evaluate increases in capacity at our operations to anticipate potential demand and enable us to deliver critical capabilities.\n\nOur  business  and  financial  performance  is  also  affected  by  general  economic  conditions.  We  continue  to  ex perience  supply  chain  challenges,  including supplier shortages and performance issues. These issues have delayed certain customer deliveries, have been a limiting factor on our ability to ramp up production in response to customer demand for certain products and have caused out-of-sequence manufacturing, which increases costs and decreases operational efficiency. In addition, elevated levels of inflation and macroeconomic conditions present risks for us, our suppliers and the stability of the broader defense industrial base. Certain costs, including rising labor rates and supplier costs, have increased as a result of inflation, and have adversely affected our margins on certain programs. In addition, some suppliers are reducing the duration of pricing validity of their proposals to us or seeking to reopen pricing on existing agreements, which is operationally challenging and increases the risk of cost volatility. We continue to work to mitigate challenges caused by the supply chain or current macroeconomic environment on our business, including by supporting small business and at-risk suppliers, deploying resources to work with our supply chain, securing materials and support by executing  long-term  contracts,  enforcing  existing  contract  terms,  identifying  alternative  sources,  collaborating  with  our  customers  to  address  industry-wide challenges, and optimizing our supply chain organization through digital transformation and workforce development. If we experience significant supply chain issues or high rates of inflation, and are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our future profits, margins and cash flows, particularly for ex isting fix ed-price contracts, may be adversely affected.  Inflation and higher interest rates can also constrain the overall purchasing power of our customers for our products and services potentially impacting future orders, especially in a budget constrained environment. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services, which may, in part, offset cost increases from inflation.\n\n## International Business\n\nA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our international business is conducted either by FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2024, approximately 73% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 27% were DCS. Additionally, in 2024, substantially all of our sales from international customers were in our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments. Space's sales from international customers were not material in 2024. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.\n\nIn 2024, international customers accounted for 32% of Aeronautics' net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. G overnment and seven international partner countries and twelve FMS customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. G overnment and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of",

RTX's chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our President and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses segment operating profit as a profitability measure to assess actual and forecasted segment performance to make decisions regarding incentive compensation and the allocation of capital and other investments. Total net sales and operating profit (loss) by segment include inter-segment sales which are generally recorded at cost-plus a specified fee or at a negotiated fixed price. These pricing arrangements may result in margins different than what the purchasing segment realizes on the ultimate third-party sales.\n\nWe present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and PRB  expense  under  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  (FAS)  requirements  of  U.S.  GAAP  and  our  pension  and  PRB  expense  under  U.S.  government  Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our Raytheon segment. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally ex pect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis.\n\nAcquisition  accounting  adjustments  include  the  amortization  of  acquired  intangible  assets  related  to  acquisitions,  the  amortization  of  the  property,  plant,  and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss-making or below-market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable.

      "answer": "3M reported a pretax gain of $108 million from foreign currency contracts in 2022, which could influence its overall financial stability. During the same period, Union Pacific's other subsidiary revenues declined by $2 million from 2020 to 2021, indicating a relatively stable but slightly negative trend in non-core revenue streams. Comparing these figures, 3M's pretax gains from foreign currency contracts are significantly higher than the decrease in Union Pacific's other subsidiary revenues, suggesting that 3M's financial volatility from non-operational factors is more pronounced than Union Pacific\u2019s from its non-core business segments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\n## Accounting for Long-term Contracts\n\nSubstantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or serv ices and the significant serv ice of integration that we prov ide.\n\nAccounting for long-term contracts inv olv es a judgmental process of estimating the total rev enue, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and rev enue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.\n\nDue to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total rev enues and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many v ariables. T otal rev enue estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract  options,  change  orders,  incentiv e  and  award  fee  prov isions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  as inflation  or  index-based  clauses).  T he  majority  of  these  long-term  contracts  are  with  the  U.S.  gov ernment  where  the  price  is  generally  based  on  the estimated  cost  to  produce  the  product  or  serv ice  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  prov ide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be reimbursed  in  establishing  contract  price.  T otal  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and supplier performance trends, production quality, labor instability, supply chain delays and quality issues, business v olume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.\n\nRevenue and cost estimates for all significant  long-term  contract  performance  obligations  are  rev iewed  and  reassessed  quarterly.  Changes  in  these estimates could result in recognition of cumulativ e catch-up adjustments to the contract's inception to date rev enues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in rev enue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reachforward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. Net cumulativ e catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated rev enues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts, including the impact of estimated losses on unexercised options, increased Loss from operations by $6,562 million, $2,943 million and $5,253 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely, and were primarily due to losses recognized on the KC-46A T anker, T -7A Red Hawk, Commercial Crew, VC-25B, and MQ-25 programs. These are all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.\n\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described abov e, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different  assumptions  or  if  the  underlying  circumstances  were  to  change.  For  example,  changes  in  underlying  operational  assumptions,  inability  to implement  planned  risk  mitigation  plans,  failure  to  achiev e  productiv ity  targets,  supplier  shortages,  quality  issues  and/or  pricing  issues,  inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adv ersely affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts  had  been  estimated  to  be  higher  or  lower  by  1%  during  2024,  it  would  hav e  increased  or  decreased  pre-tax  income  for  the  year  by approximately $290 million.\n\n## Program Accounting\n\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate rev enues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number",

We develop a culture of health and safety by:\n\n- investing in safety training and audits;\n- promoting wellness practices which mitigate risk; and\n- offering benefits designed to keep employees safe in the workplace and beyond.\n\nOur local health and safety committees coach employees on UPS's safety processes and are able to share best practices across work groups. Our safety methods and procedures are increasingly focused on the variables associated with residential delivery environments, which have become more common with the growth in e-commerce. We monitor our performance in this area through various measurable targets including lost time injury frequency and the number of recorded auto accidents.\n\n## Customers\n\nBuilding and maintaining long-term customer relationships is a competitive strength of UPS. In 2021, we served 1.7 million shipping customers and more than 11.8 million delivery customers daily. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, represented approximately 11.7% of our consolidated revenues, substantially all of which was within our U.S. Domestic Package segment. For additional information on our customers, see 'Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - Changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us' and note 15 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe offer a broad array of transportation and logistics services and compete with many local, regional, national and international logistics providers as well as national postal services. We believe our strategy, network and competitive strengths position us well to compete in the marketplace. For additional information on our competitive environment, see \"Risk Factors Business and Operating Risks - Our industry is rapidly evolving. We expect to continue to face significant competition, which could materially adversely affect us\".\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Continued compliance with increasingly stringent laws, regulations and policies in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate may result in materially increased costs, or we could be subject to substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations.\n\n## Air Operations\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation ('DOT'), the Federal Aviation Administration ('FAA') and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration ('TSA'), have primary regulatory authority over our air transportation services.\n\nThe DOT's authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as operating authority, insurance requirements, pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates international routes, fares, rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments or, in the absence of such agreements, by principles of reciprocity. We are also subject to current and potential aviation, health, customs and immigration regulations imposed by governments in other countries in which we operate, including registration and license requirements and security regulations. We have international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is subject to DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions.\n\nThe FAA's authority primarily relates to operational, technical and safety aspects of air transportation, including certification, aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. customs regulation.",

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7.

In addition, we experienced severe winter weather in the prior year which positively affected the year-over-year comparisons in 2022.\n\nRevenue at FedEx Express increased 9% in 2022 due to global package and international priority freight yield improvement, partially offset by decreased international and U.S. domestic package volume, as well as lower U.S. average daily freight pounds. At FedEx Ground, revenue increased 9% in 2022 primarily due to yield improvement, two additional ground commercial operating days, a mix shift to higher-yielding services, and growth in our commercial services. FedEx Freight revenue increased 22% in 2022 primarily due to higher revenue per shipment and increased average daily shipments. Revenue at Corporate, other, and eliminations increased 33% in 2022 primarily due to higher yields at FedEx Logistics, Inc. ('FedEx Logistics') as a result of market capacity constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWhile fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. See the 'Fuel' section of this MD&amp;A for more information.\n\n## Business Realignment Costs\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan will affect approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a works council consultation process that will occur through 2023 in accordance with local country processes and regulations.\n\nWe incurred costs of $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 and $116 million ($90 million, net of tax, or $0.33 per diluted share) in 2021 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $225 million in 2022 and approximately $15 million in 2021. We expect the pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities to be approximately $420 million through 2023. We expect savings from our business realignment activities to be between $275 million and $350 million on an annualized basis beginning in 2024. The actual amount and timing of business realignment costs and related cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectations and estimates.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nThe following table compares operating expenses expressed as dollar amounts (in millions) and as a percent of revenue for the years ended May 31:\n\n",

      "answer": "UPS applied a 2.50% cash balance interest credit rate to its U.S. Pension Benefits in 2022, which is used in calculating pension obligations. This rate is directly relevant to how pension liabilities are projected. Meanwhile, CAT disclosed that its expected U.S. pension benefit payments for 2022 were $1,035 million. The cash balance interest credit rate influences the present value of pension obligations, which in turn affects the expected benefit payments.",

      "answer": "A five percent reduction in claim frequency would decrease UPS's self-insurance reserves and expenses by approximately $290 million, based on their 2021 data. This demonstrates a direct and quantifiable sensitivity to claim frequency assumptions. FDX also relies on actuarial estimates for self-insurance reserves, factoring in claim severity, frequency, healthcare inflation, and seasonality. While FDX does not specify a dollar impact for a similar reduction, their reserves are also subject to material changes from shifts in claim frequency. Both companies disclose significant exposure to actuarial assumptions, though UPS provides a concrete sensitivity metric while FDX emphasizes the inherent uncertainty and long settlement period for claims.",

Components of our self-insurance reserves included in this critical accounting estimate are workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. These reserves are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. These estimates include judgment about severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. The use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years.\n\nWe believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, insurance retention levels, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities and affect our results of operations.

These efforts were part of broader business transformation initiatives that included divestitures like the dental local anesthetic business. In contrast, RTX's restructuring actions were primarily cost containment measures driven by geopolitical challenges, including $141 million in charges from exiting a Russia-based joint venture and $69 million in costs tied to divesting two non-core businesses. While MMM focused on mitigating supply chain and transformation-related margin pressures through pricing and productivity actions, RTX emphasized workforce reductions and divestiture-driven cost optimization amid geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MMM \u2192 Operating Income Margins: MMM's operating income margins were negatively impacted by $0.8 billion in PFAS exit costs, raw material inflation, Belgium shutdowns, and manufacturing headwinds.",
        "Hop 2: Operating Income Margins \u2192 Restructuring Actions: MMM's restructuring actions were specifically designed to counteract these margin pressures through spending discipline, pricing, and productivity improvements.",
        "Hop 3: Restructuring Actions \u2190 RTX: RTX disclosed restructuring actions related to workforce reductions and $210 million in combined charges from exiting a Russia-based joint venture and divesting two non-core businesses."

      "answer": "In 2024, LMT's intersegment sales to its Space segment increased to $392 million from $358 million in 2023, reflecting a growth of $34 million or approximately 9.5%. Meanwhile, CAT's total intersegment sales in 2024 were $5,248 million, a decrease from $5,109 million in 2023, representing an increase of $139 million or about 2.7%. This indicates that while LMT saw a notable rise in internal sales supporting its Space segment, CAT experienced a broader increase in intersegment activity across its reportable segments, albeit at a lower relative growth rate.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT \u2192 Intersegment Sales: CAT's 2024 intersegment sales were $5,248 million, up from $5,109 million in 2023, showing a $139 million or 2.7% increase across its reportable segments.",

        "Hop 3: Space \u2190 LMT: LMT operates in four segments including Space, which is involved in programs such as the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile modernization, and its intersegment sales reflect internal support for such initiatives."

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) is intended to help the reader understand our results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a  supplement  to,  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  consolidated  financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\nThe  MD&amp;A generally  discusses  2024  and  2023  items  and  year-to-year  comparisons  between  2024  and  2023.  Discussions  of  2022  items  and  year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations' in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on January 23, 2024.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nWe are  a  global  aerospace  and  defense  company  principally  engaged  in  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and  sustainment  of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. G overnment. In 2024, 73% of our $71.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. G overnment, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 65% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 26% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers.\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.\n\nOur  21st  Century  Security vision  is  to  accelerate  the  adoption  of  advanced  networking  and  other  leading-edge  technologies  into  the American  defense enterprise,  while  enhancing  the  performance  and  value  of  our  platforms  and  products  for  our  customers.  The  aim  of  21st  Century  Security  is  to  integrate  and continuously upgrade new and existing systems across all domains with advanced, open-architecture networking and operational technologies that make defense forces more agile, adaptive and unpredictable, enabling overmatch and strengthening deterrence today and into the future. \u00ae\n\n21st Century Security guides our strategy and investments. As our growth pillars continue to evolve, we are focusing on advancing all-domain mission solutions through investments in digital technologies such as Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)/Machine  Learning  (ML), Autonomy and  Crewed/Uncrewed  Teaming,  G enerative Design and other technologies and capabilities  enabling  Combined  Joint All-Domain  Command  and  Control  (CJADC2).  Innovations  in  these  areas  will  expand capability, improve interoperability, increase demand for our multi-domain solutions and drive efficient conversion of backlog into growth across our portfolio. We have well established programs across our business segments that continue to experience growth, including F-35 sustainment activity (Aeronautics); increased Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) production rates and increased demand for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS ) and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) (Missiles and Fire Control); radar surveillance systems and CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter (Rotary and Mission Systems); and the modernization of and enhancements to the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) (Space). Additionally, our teams continue to transform our products and rapidly innovate for the future, developing 6th generation air dominance technologies within Skunk Works , demonstrating autonomous capabilities with the X-62A (F-16) and optionally piloted BLACK HAWK ,  creating new Joint All-Domain Operating systems with Defense of G uam and AIR 6500 in Australia, establishing small-to-medium satellite capabilities to support proliferated space constellations and advancing hypersonic capabilities. Finally, we are always in pursuit of new program awards to develop future platforms that enable us to continue to strengthen our national defense and advance deterrence and global security. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nKeys  to  enabling  success  of  our  strategy  include  developing  and  investing  in  differentiating  technologies,  forging  strategic  partnerships,  including  with commercial companies, executing on our multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance our digital infrastructure and increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our business and maintaining fiscal discipline. Underpinning our ability to execute our strategy is our talent and culture. We invest substantially in our people to ensure that our workforce has the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we expect to continue to invest internally in innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We also will continue to evaluate our portfolio and will make strategic acquisitions or divestitures, as appropriate, while deepening our connection to commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures and equity investments.",

In comparison, a 50 basis point increase or decrease in EROA would decrease or increase FDX's pension expense by $127 million.

      "answer": "Honeywell reported a robust backlog of $31.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, which represents firm orders that will be converted into revenue as products are delivered or services are performed. Similarly, Raytheon Technologies reported a significantly larger backlog of $196 billion as of the same date, which also represents the aggregate value of firm orders not yet fulfilled. Both companies define backlog as the value of remaining performance obligations (RPO) from firm orders, excluding unexercised contract options and potential orders under IDIQ-type contracts. This indicates that while both companies measure future revenue potential using the same metric, Raytheon\u2019s forward-looking sales pipeline is more than six times larger than Honeywell\u2019s.",

      "answer": "3M's Transportation and Electronics segment, which includes the Advanced Materials reporting unit, experienced a 4.5% total sales decline in 2023, partly due to the company's exit from PFAS manufacturing, which also triggered a goodwill impairment charge in 2022. In contrast, Honeywell's Advanced Materials segment focuses on high-performance products such as bullet-resistant armor, computer chips, and low global warming potential materials based on hydrofluoroolefin technology. While 3M's Advanced Materials unit faced financial headwinds from strategic divestitures and PFAS-related adjustments, Honeywell's positioning in sustainable materials suggests a different growth trajectory aligned with environmental innovation.",

      "answer": "At UPS, lower volumes in 2023 led to a $730 million reduction in the cost of operating the integrated international air and ground network, driven by fewer air charters and aircraft block hours. At FedEx, reduced volumes at FedEx Express and FedEx Logistics contributed to a decline in the Corporate, Other, and Eliminations segment revenue, and were also linked to a $157 million noncash impairment charge in 2024 related to aircraft retirements, as well as $331 million in business optimization costs within that segment. This indicates that while volume declines reduced operating costs at UPS, they triggered asset impairments and restructuring costs at FedEx, reflecting different strategic and financial responses to volume fluctuations.",

This contrast suggests divergent performance in industrial-facing businesses, with Honeywell benefiting from stronger project-based demand in process industries, whereas 3M's Transportation and Electronics segment faced headwinds despite acquisition support, potentially signaling differing exposures to global industrial and transportation market trends.",

      "answer": "MMM's operating income margins in 2023 were negatively impacted by a $0.8 billion asset impairment charge related to its exit from PFAS manufacturing, increased raw materials and logistics costs, and manufacturing productivity headwinds\u2014particularly from the shutdown of operations in Belgium. These margin pressures coincided with a decline in Health Care sales by 2.8% in U.S. dollars, held back by reduced demand in separation and purification due to normalization of post-COVID biopharma activity and tighter hospital budgets affecting health information systems. In contrast, HON reported 3% sales growth in 2023 to $36.7 billion, driven by strong demand in Commercial Aviation, Defense & Space, and Process Solutions. This divergence highlights how MMM's internal cost and restructuring challenges dampened growth, while HON leveraged strategic business alignment and end-market demand to achieve expansion.",

      "question": "How does a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates impact FDX's pension expense compared to how LMT accounts for pension costs under its U.S. Government contract-adjusted pension framework?",
      "answer": "A 50 basis point decrease in interest rates positively impacts FDX's pension expense by increasing it by $127 million, as shown in FDX's 2023 10-K filing. In contrast, LMT accounts for pension costs under a U.S. Government contract-adjusted pension framework, where it recovers CAS pension costs through pricing on government contracts and reports a FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment that reflects the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income/expense and total CAS pension cost. This structural difference means FDX experiences direct financial sensitivity to interest rate changes, while LMT's pension accounting is more closely aligned with regulatory cost recovery mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: FDX \u2192 50 Basis Point Decrease: A 50 basis point decrease in interest rates increases FDX's pension expense by $127 million according to sensitivity analysis in financial disclosures.",
        "Hop 2: 50 Basis Point Decrease \u2192 Pension Expense: Interest rate decreases directly increase pension expense due to higher present value of pension obligations, as demonstrated by FDX's quantified sensitivity analysis.",
        "Hop 3: Pension Expense \u2190 LMT: LMT accounts for pension costs differently, using a FAS/CAS adjustment framework that aligns with U.S. Government contract cost recovery rules rather than direct GAAP pension expense recognition."

BUSINESS\n\n(Dollars in millions, except per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)\n\n## BUSINESS OVERVIEW\n\nGeneral Dynamics is a global aerospace and defense company that specializes in high-end design, engineering and manufacturing to deliver state-of-the-art solutions to our customers. We offer a broad portfolio of products and  services  in  business  aviation;  ship  construction  and  repair;  land  combat  vehicles,  weapons  systems  and munitions; and technology products and services. Our leadership positions in attractive business aviation and defense markets enable us to deliver superior and enduring shareholder returns.\n\nOur company consists of 10 business units, which are organized into four operating segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies. We refer to the latter  three  collectively  as  our  defense segments. To optimize its market focus, customer intimacy, agility and operating expertise, each business unit is responsible for the development and execution of its strategy and operating results. This structure allows for a lean corporate function, which sets the overall strategy and governance for the company and is responsible for allocating and deploying capital.\n\nOur  business  units  seek  to  deliver  superior  operating  results  by  endeavoring  to  build  industry-leading franchises.  To  achieve  this  goal,  we  invest  in  advanced  technologies,  pursue  a  culture  of  continuous improvement, and strive to be the low-cost, high-quality provider in each of our markets. The result is long-term value creation measured by strong earnings and cash flow and an attractive return on capital.\n\nOver  the  past  nine  years,  we  have  invested  approximately  $22  billion  to  create,  renew  or  expand  our portfolio  of  products  and  services  across  our  businesses  to  drive  long-term  growth  and  shareholder  value creation. This includes product development investments in Aerospace to bring to market an all-new lineup of business jet aircraft, capital investments in Marine Systems to support significant growth in U.S. Navy ship and submarine  construction  plans  over  the  next  two  decades,  development  of  next-generation  platforms  and technologies  to  meet  customers'  emerging  requirements  in  Combat  Systems,  and  strategic  acquisitions  to achieve critical mass and build out a complete spectrum of solutions for our Technologies customers.\n\nFollowing is additional information on each of our operating segments. For a supplemental discussion of segment  performance  and  backlog,  see  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and Results of Operations in Item 7.\n\n## AEROSPACE\n\nOur Aerospace segment is recognized as a leading producer of business jets and the standard bearer in aircraft repair, support and completion services. The segment consists of our Gulfstream and Jet Aviation business units. We have earned our reputation through:\n\n- superior aircraft design, quality, performance, safety and reliability;\n- technologically advanced flight deck and cabin systems; and\n- industry-leading customer support.",

      "answer": "RTX reported a $703 million decline in organic sales in 2023, reflecting significant challenges in its core markets. Meanwhile, MMM's Consumer segment experienced a 4.7% organic sales contraction during the same period, indicating softer demand in consumer-facing markets. While RTX's decline is expressed in absolute dollars and suggests broader operational or market pressures, MMM's percentage-based decline highlights specific consumer behavior shifts. Together, these figures suggest that industrial conglomerates faced both macroeconomic volatility and segment-specific demand fluctuations in 2023.",

      "answer": "LMT's patents and trademarks are described as key components of its intellectual property portfolio, which contributes significantly to its business and competitive positioning. These protections are potentially vulnerable due to government rights and licensing constraints. Meanwhile, RTX's exclusivity assets, which are also vital to its competitive strategy, have a reported lifespan ranging from 5 to 25 years. This overlaps with the typical duration of patents and trademarks, which RTX reports as lasting 5 to 30 years, indicating a closely aligned but slightly shorter upper bound for exclusivity assets. This comparison suggests that both companies rely on time-bound legal protections for competitive advantage, though LMT faces additional external constraints on its IP utilization due to government contract stipulations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## We may be unable to benefit fully from or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or use third-party intellectual property, which could negatively affect our business.\n\nWe own a substantial number of U.S. and foreign patents and trademarks related to the products and services we provide. In addition to owning a large portfolio of patents and trademarks, we develop and own other intellectual property, including copyrights, trade secrets and research, development and engineering knowhow, which contribute significantly to our business. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. The FAR and DFARS provide that the U.S. Government obtains certain rights in intellectual property, including patents, developed by us and our subcontractors and suppliers in performance of government contracts or with government funding. The U.S. G overnment may use, or may authorize others including competitors to use, such intellectual property. Non-U.S. governments  also  may  have  certain  rights  in  patents  and  other  intellectual  property  developed  in  performance  of  our  contracts  with  these  entities.  The  U.S. Government is pursuing aggressive positions on the acquisition of broad data and software packages as well as the scope and applicability of these rights once acquired.  The  DoD is  also  implementing  an  overarching  intellectual  property  acquisition  policy  that  will  require  a  greater  focus  and  planning  as  to  intellectual property rights for its programs, with the potential impacts of this policy or any associated regulatory changes on future acquisitions yet to be determined. The DoD's efforts could affect our ability to protect and exploit our intellectual property and to leverage supplier intellectual property, for ex ample, if we are unable to obtain necessary licenses from our suppliers to meet government requirements. Additionally, third parties may assert that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights, which could result in costly and time-consuming disputes, subject us to damages and injunctions and adversely affect our ability to compete and perform on certain contracts.\n\n## Our business and financial performance depends on us identifying, attracting and retaining a highly skilled workforce.\n\nOur performance is dependent upon us identifying, attracting, developing, motivating and retaining a highly skilled workforce with the requisite skills in multiple areas  including  engineering,  science,  manufacturing,  information  technology,  cybersecurity,  business  development  and  strategy  and  management.  Due  to  the national security nature of our work, our performance is also dependent upon personnel who hold security clearances and receive substantial training to work on certain programs or tasks and can be difficult to replace on a timely basis if we ex perience unplanned attrition. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry as well as the market for individuals holding high-level security clearances is extremely competitive and not confined to our industry. For example, we compete with commercial technology companies outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical, cyber and scientific positions, which may not face the same type of cost pressures as a government contractor and which may be able to offer more flexible work arrangements given that certain of our employees must perform the majority of their work in a secure facility because of the need to access classified information. If we cannot adequately attract and retain personnel with the requisite skills or clearances in this competitive market, our performance and future prospects may be adversely affected.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented flexible work arrangements and a hybrid workforce model, where portions of our workforce work remotely while  others  are  required  to  be  on-site  in  our  facilities  depending  on,  among  other  things,  the  nature  of  the  job  performed,  business  needs,  and  evolving circumstances. In conjunction with this, it is critical that we develop and train employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage the short and longterm transfer of critical knowledge and skills, including leadership development and succession planning throughout our business. While we have processes in place for management transition and the transfer of knowledge and skills, the loss of key personnel, coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel, hire new personnel or transfer knowledge and skills, could significantly impact our ability to perform under our contracts and execute on new or growing programs.\n\nAdditionally, approximately 19% of our workforce is comprised of employees that are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. If we encounter difficulties with renegotiations or renewals of collective bargaining arrangements or are unsuccessful in those efforts, we could incur additional costs and experience work stoppages. Union actions at suppliers also can affect us. Any delays or work stoppages could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contracts, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Cyber-attacks and other security threats and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAs an aerospace and defense company, we face a multitude of security threats, including cybersecurity threats ranging from attacks common to most industries, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, to attacks from more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation state actors, some of which target  the  defense  industrial  base  and  other  critical  infrastructure  sectors.  The  sophistication  of  the  threats  continues  to  evolve  and  grow ,  including  the  risk associated with the use of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, for nefarious purposes. In addition to cybersecurity threats, we face threats to the security of our facilities and employees from terrorist acts, sabotage and other disruptions, any of which could adversely affect our business.

In contrast, Caterpillar's contributions to non-U.S. plans remained constant at $114 million for each of the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. This indicates that while UPS experienced growth in this specific benefit-related expense, Caterpillar's contributions to non-U.S. plans were stable and unchanged.",

      "question": "How did the $11.0 billion increase in GE's profit compare to the growth in CAT Financial Products' profit, and what does this suggest about the performance of industrial financing activities across both companies?",
      "answer": "GE reported a $11.0 billion increase in profit for 2023, driven in part by gains on retained and sold ownership interests and improved segment profit. In comparison, CAT Financial Products' profit increased by $45 million (5%) to $909 million in 2023, primarily due to a higher net yield on average earning assets and lower credit losses. Both companies saw growth in their financial services segments, with CAT specifically noting improved performance in its financing activities. The significantly larger profit increase at GE suggests broader gains across its diversified operations, while CAT Financial's more modest growth reflects targeted improvements in its financing portfolio.",

        "Hop 1: GE \u2192 Profit: GE's profit increased by $11.0 billion in 2023, driven by gains on retained/sold ownership interests and higher segment profit",

      "question": "How might Emerson's 4% underlying volume growth in 2023 have contributed to FedEx Ground's 2% revenue increase in 2024, particularly given FedEx's Network 2.0 optimization efforts aimed at improving efficiency in pickup and delivery operations?",
      "answer": "Emerson experienced 4% underlying volume growth in 2023, which likely translated into increased industrial shipping demand. This growth could have positively impacted FedEx Ground, as higher shipment volumes are a key driver of revenue for logistics segments. Indeed, FedEx Ground saw a 2% revenue increase in 2024, attributed in part to higher volume. This aligns with FedEx's broader Network 2.0 optimization initiative, which focuses on improving efficiency in pickup and delivery operations across more than 50 U.S. locations, suggesting that FedEx was strategically positioned to handle increased industrial logistics demand driven by companies like Emerson.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: EMR \u2192 Volume: Emerson's 2023 earnings report shows 4% underlying volume growth, indicating increased industrial activity and potential for higher logistics demand.",
        "Hop 2: Volume \u2192 FedEx Ground: FedEx Ground's 2024 revenue increased by 2%, with volume cited as a key contributing factor, showing direct sensitivity to changes in shipment volumes.",
        "Hop 3: FedEx Ground \u2190 FDX: FedEx's Network 2.0 optimization efforts focus on improving pickup and delivery efficiency across more than 50 U.S. locations, suggesting strategic readiness to capitalize on increased shipping demand."

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS experienced increased third-party transportation costs which contributed to higher operating expenses in the Supply Chain Solutions segment, despite revenue growth from Forwarding and Logistics. UPS reported that these cost increases were partially offset by productivity improvements and lower third-party carrier costs for SurePost and rail due to lower volumes. Boeing's Supply Chain Solutions segment, which includes logistics and inventory services, is likely exposed to similar cost pressures from third-party transportation providers, which could affect its operational efficiency and pricing strategy in a post-pandemic market environment.",

Prior to COVID-19, we had expected  the  market  to  grow  by  around  3.5%  annually,  however,  the  pandemic  is  having  a  direct  impact  on  our commercial services business. See Overview to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.\n\nOver  the  long-term,  as  the  size  of  the  worldwide  commercial  airline  fleet  continues  to  grow,  so  does  demand  for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics  to  plan  flight  operations  and  predictive  maintenance  to  improve  their  productivity  and  efficiency.  Airlines continue  to  look  for  opportunities  to  reduce  the  size  and  cost  of  their  spare  parts  inventory,  frequently  outsourcing spares management to third parties.\n\nThe demand outlook for our government services business has remained stable in 2021. Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government  services  market  is  the  single  largest  individual  market,  comprising  over  50  percent  of  the  government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.\n\nBGS' major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 39, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.\n\nIndustry  Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market  with many  domestic  and  international competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n",

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7.

Cost of living and wage-rate adjustments driven by inflation and other market factors also drove higher compensation costs. Volume growth also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by productivity improvements. Management payroll increased, primarily due to incentive compensation and commission payments.\n- Higher third-party transportation costs as a result of our investments to improve time-in-transit within our ground network partially offset by lower third-party carrier costs for SurePost and rail due to lower volumes.\n- The reallocation of expense for the GFP product following the divestiture of UPS Freight resulted in an increase of $281 million in segment operating expenses.\n\nTotal cost per piece, and adjusted cost per piece excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, increased 7.4%. We anticipate that overall costs and cost per piece may continue to increase during 2022 as a result of contractual cost increases and market factors, including inflation and the availability and cost of labor. We expect this expense growth to moderate in 2022 due to additional operational improvements.\n\n## Operating Profit and Margin\n\nAs a result of the factors described above, operating profit increased $2.5 billion, with operating margin increasing 340 basis points to 10.7%. Excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, adjusted operating profit increased $2.6 billion, with adjusting operating margin increasing 340 basis points to 11.1%.",

Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\n\nWe  derive  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  from  a  limited  number  of  commercial  airlines. We  can  make  no assurance  that  any  customer  will  exercise  purchase  options,  fulfill  existing  purchase  commitments  or  purchase additional  products  or  services  from  us.  In  addition,  fleet  decisions,  airline  consolidations  or  financial  challenges involving  any  of  our  major  commercial  airline  customers  could  significantly  reduce  our  revenues  and  limit  our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n\nOur Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specification, achieve planned production rate  targets,  successfully  develop  new  aircraft  or  new  derivative  aircraft,  and  meet  or  exceed  stringent performance and reliability standards.\n\nThe commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S.  suppliers,  highly-skilled  labor  from  thousands  of  employees  and  other  partners,  and  stringent  regulatory requirements,  including  the  risk  of  evolving  standards  for  commercial  aircraft  certification,  and  performance  and reliability standards. The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the implementation of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, among them changing the process for certification of commercial aircraft. Comparable agencies that regulate similar matters in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or other similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. The 737 program experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of commercial operations of the 737 MAX aircraft by civil aviation  authorities around the globe. 737 MAX deliveries resumed in late 2020 and early 2021 upon approval of the FAA and other nonU.S. civil aviation authorities. During 2020 and 2021, we experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries, including a pause in 787 deliveries since May 2021. During 2021, this  resulted  in  reprioritizing  production  resources  to  support  inspections  and  rework.  We  continue  to  conduct inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries as well as rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the  contractual  delivery  date.  The  regulators  will  ultimately  determine  the  timing  and  conditions  for  resuming  787 deliveries. Delays on the 737 MAX, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\n\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to  adjust  production  rates  on  several  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs.  During  2021,  we  reprioritized  production resources to support inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft. The 787 program is currently producing at very low rates and expects that to continue until deliveries resume. We are also continuing to implement changes in the production  process  designed  to  ensure  that  newly-built  airplanes  meet  our  specifications  and  do  not  require  further inspections  and  rework.  In  addition,  we  continue  to  seek  opportunities  to  reduce  the  costs  of  building  our  aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory.

      "question": "Given FedEx Ground's Network 2.0 optimization and its impact on volume handling efficiency, how might Emerson Electric's 4% volume growth in 2024 influence FedEx's ability to offset lower fuel surcharge revenue while maintaining profitability improvements outlined in the DRIVE program?",
      "answer": "FedEx Ground's Network 2.0 optimization, which includes consolidating sortation facilities and optimizing pickup-and-delivery routes, is designed to improve efficiency in handling package volumes. Emerson Electric experienced 4% volume growth in its underlying sales in 2024, which likely translates into increased shipping demand. This aligns with FedEx Ground's reported 2% revenue increase in 2024, driven by base yield improvement and higher volume, despite lower fuel surcharges. The optimization efforts under the DRIVE program aim to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency, which could help FedEx offset declining fuel surcharge revenue by leveraging increased volume from shippers like Emerson to improve asset utilization and network efficiency.",

        "Hop 1: FDX \u2192 FedEx Ground: FedEx announced Network 2.0, a multi-year optimization initiative focused on improving efficiency in pickup, transport, and delivery operations, including consolidation of facilities and route optimization.",
        "Hop 2: FedEx Ground \u2192 Volume: FedEx Ground reported a 2% revenue increase in 2024, driven by higher volume and base yield improvement, even as fuel surcharges declined across transportation segments.",
        "Hop 3: Volume \u2190 EMR: Emerson Electric reported 4% volume growth in underlying sales in 2024, suggesting increased shipping demand that could positively impact FedEx's package volume and network utilization."

      "answer": "Pratt & Whitney reported an operating loss margin of (8.0)% in 2023, which was driven in part by a $491 million allowance for expected credit losses as of December 31, 2024, primarily related to a customer bankruptcy recorded in the fourth quarter. In contrast, GE's operating profit margin improved to 20.7% in 2024, up 330 basis points from the prior year.

      "answer": "Boeing's 737 MAX delivery challenges, which included grounding in most non-U.S. jurisdictions through 2021 and expected resumption in China in 2022, constrained its aircraft deliveries to 245 units in 2021 and left 335 airplanes in inventory. These disruptions led to abnormal production costs of $2,567 million in 2020 and $1,887 million in 2021, with residual impacts expected through early 2022. Despite these setbacks, General Dynamics reported that aircraft orders in 2021 reached their highest level in over a decade, signaling strong market demand that could support a rebound in the aerospace segment. However, RTX's aerospace segment still faced lingering costs from its 2020 separation of Carrier and Otis, including $888 million in 2020 and $1.3 billion in 2019 in separation-related expenses, which indicates that structural changes and market uncertainty continued to weigh on aerospace financial performance. Therefore, while Boeing's production and delivery issues may delay its own recovery, the broader aerospace segment's rebound appears resilient due to strong order intake, though legacy restructuring costs\u2014like those seen at RTX\u2014suggest full recovery may take time.",

Deliveries  of  the  737  MAX  were suspended following these orders. Deliveries in the U.S. resumed in late 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding  order.  In  addition,  several  other  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities,  including  the  Brazilian  National  Civil Aviation Agency,  Transport  Canada,  and  the  European  Union Aviation  Safety Agency  have  subsequently  approved return of operations, allowing us to resume deliveries in those jurisdictions. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued an airworthiness directive in the fourth quarter of 2021 outlining actions required for airlines to return to service. We expect 737 MAX deliveries to China to resume in 2022, subject to final regulatory approvals, although risk remains around  the  timing  and  rate  of  those  deliveries.  Over  185  countries  have  approved  the  resumption  of  737  MAX operations. The 737 MAX remains grounded in a small number of non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nWe have gradually increased production rates in 2020 and 2021 and continue to expect to increase the production rate to 31 per month by early 2022, as well as implement further gradual production rate increases in subsequent periods based on market demand and supply chain capacity.\n\nWe produced at abnormally low production rates in 2020 and 2021 and expensed abnormal production costs of $1,887 and $2,567 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We do not expect the remaining abnormal costs related to the 737 MAX to be significant and expect most of the remainder to be incurred in early 2022.\n\nIn 2021, we delivered 245 aircraft. We have approximately 335 airplanes in inventory as of December 31, 2021 and we anticipate  delivering  most  of  these  aircraft  by  the  end  of  2023.  We  continue  to  work  with  customers  who  have requested  to  defer  deliveries  or  to  cancel  orders  for  737  MAX  aircraft,  and  we  are  remarketing  and/or  delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in China  and/or  ramp  up  deliveries  consistent  with  our  assumptions,  our  expectation  of  delivery  timing  and  our expectation regarding future gradual production rate increases could be impacted.",

Any long-term impact to our business is currently unknown  due  to  the  uncertainty  around  the  pandemic's  duration  and  its  broader  impact.  For  additional information, see the Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.\n\nThe  United  States  and  other  governments  have  taken  several  steps  to  respond  to  the  pandemic.  On September 9, 2021, the president signed Executive Order 14042, initiating a process whereby covered federal contractors and subcontractors must implement federally required vaccine mandates. A clause implementing the federal  contractor  vaccine  mandate  has  been  incorporated  into  a  number  of  our  federal  contracts.  In  light  of certain court orders, however, the Office of Management and Budget has stated that the U.S. government will not take action to enforce this clause until further notice. If ultimately upheld, this federal contract requirement may  affect  various  business  units  differently.  We  are  working  closely  with  our  customer  to  ensure  that  we minimize disruptions  and  potential  employee  attrition  in  the  event  that  applicable  contract  modifications  are enforceable and as additional modifications are received that could trigger implementation. To the extent that we  or  our  subcontractors  experience  employee  attrition  and/or  work  stoppages,  our  costs  could  increase, schedules could slip on affected programs and our ability to perform under some contracts could be negatively affected, particularly in those instances where we cannot receive cost reimbursement.\n\nOur Aerospace segment's operating results have experienced the most significant impact from the pandemic. New  aircraft  deliveries  in  2021  reflected  our  decision  in  2020  to  reduce  production  rates  to  accommodate supply chain challenges and reduced demand due to the pandemic. However, aircraft demand has been strong in 2021,  with  orders  reaching  their  highest  level  in  over  a  decade.  Similarly,  demand  for  aircraft  services  has improved as air travel has increased, but remains below pre-pandemic levels in some regions of the world. Our U.S. government business continues to experience some disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in  our  Technologies  segment.  The  Review  of  Operating  Segments  includes  additional  information  on  the impacts of the pandemic for the affected segments.",

See 'Note 3: Discontinued Operations' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nThe change in Net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of $377 million and the related change in diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations of $0.28 in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher prior year costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses, including debt extinguishment costs of $611 million, net of tax, in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal, partially offset by prior year Carrier and Otis operating activity, as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020.\n\nThe change in Net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of $2.4 billion and the related change in diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations of $2.65 in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to prior year Carrier and Otis operating activity, as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020, partially offset by higher prior year costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses.

      "answer": "MMM projects $745 million in postretirement benefit payments over the next five years, as disclosed in its 2023 10-K filing. In contrast, Honeywell reported a $407 million adjustment to equity in 2023 related to pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments. While MMM provides a forward-looking liability estimate, HON\u2019s adjustment reflects a current-year impact on equity, suggesting differing approaches to accounting for postretirement obligations. This could indicate that MMM\u2019s structured payment schedule may offer more predictability, whereas HON\u2019s adjustments may reflect more dynamic or volatile liability management.",

      "answer": "CAT's Financial Products Segment reported a depreciation expense of $772 million and an operating profit of $248 million in 2022, indicating a highly capital-intensive business model. In contrast, LMT faces potential profit erosion due to $781 million in standby letters of credit and performance guarantees, which could negatively impact profitability if joint ventures or partners underperform. This suggests CAT's segment is asset-heavy, while LMT's profit risks stem from contingent liabilities tied to contractual obligations.",

(a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

      "answer": "General Dynamics reported a decline in identifiable assets for Combat Systems from $11,657 million in 2021 to $10,479 million in 2023, indicating a reduction in asset base over this period. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin's Combat Systems segment includes a diverse set of offerings such as sea and land-based missile defense systems, radar systems, laser systems, and command and control mission solutions, which align closely with broader defense modernization priorities. This contrast suggests GD may be strategically reducing its footprint in Combat Systems while LMT is maintaining or expanding a comprehensive portfolio aligned with high-priority defense domains.",

      "answer": "CAT reported $0 in non-accrual receivables without an allowance for its Power segment in 2023, down from $11 million in 2022, indicating an improvement in credit risk exposure. Meanwhile, GE spent $319 million in 2023 on internally funded R&D in the Power segment, showing continued investment in innovation despite CAT's reduced credit risk. This suggests divergent financial strategies in the Power sector, with GE maintaining high R&D commitments while CAT tightens credit exposure.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's operating profit is negatively impacted by price discounting in competitive markets, particularly outside the U.S., where local competitors have inherent advantages. This pressure is evident in its 2023 order backlog decline to $27.5 billion, with margin compression risks from parts constraints and competitive intensity. In contrast, Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems segment reported stable profitability at $1.865 billion in 2023, with segment assets valued at $17.521 billion, indicating resilience in a defense-focused market with less pricing volatility. The contrast suggests that Caterpillar's exposure to cyclical commercial markets subjects it to more acute margin pressures, while Lockheed Martin benefits from relatively stable defense contracts and less competitive price sensitivity.",

      "answer": "At 3M (MMM), Research, Development and Related Expenses totaled $485 million in 2024, and as disclosed, these expenses include the service cost component of defined benefit net periodic benefit cost. This indicates that a portion of MMM's pension-related service costs is embedded within its R&D spending. In contrast, Lockheed Martin (LMT) explicitly records the service cost component of FAS income (expense) for qualified defined benefit pension plans directly in the cost of sales accounts. This shows that while MMM integrates its service cost component into broader R&D expenses, LMT maintains a more direct and transparent allocation of pension service costs into cost of sales, potentially signaling different accounting strategies for pension-related expenses between the two companies.",

This sensitivity is tied to their total backlog, which represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Boeing also faces financial risk tied to its total backlog, particularly due to reach-forward losses and abnormal production costs on major programs like the 787 and 777X, which reflect the financial impact of cost overruns and delays.

          "chunk_text": "## Estimation of costs at completion for select long-term contracts\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  B  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  accounting  for  long-term  contracts involves estimation of the costs to complete a contract in order to accurately recognize the associated revenue.  The  estimated  costs  at  completion  for  each  contract  are  used  to  assess  the  proportion  of revenues to recognize based upon the costs incurred-to-date in comparison to the total estimate of costs to complete the contract.\n\nWe identified the assessment of the estimation of costs at completion for a select group of long-term contracts in the defense segments as a critical audit matter. The estimated costs at completion for the select  group  of  long-term  contracts  incorporates  assumptions,  such  as  labor  hours  and  the  cost  of materials for the work to be performed. The evaluation of one or more of the assumptions used in the estimation of the costs to complete for the select group of contracts required a high level of subjective auditor judgment due to the nature of the individual contracts and related contract performance risks. Specifically,  changes  to  certain  assumptions  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  estimated  revenue recorded during the period.\n\nThe following are primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the estimation of costs at completion for the select group of long-term contracts. This included contract level controls over the estimated cost assumptions. For certain contracts, we compared the Company's historical estimates of  costs  to  actual  costs  incurred  to  assess  the  Company's  ability  to  estimate  accurately.  Based  on  the nature  of  the  individual  contract,  we  evaluated  certain  assumptions  within  the  Company's  estimated costs at completion by:\n\n- -reading the underlying contract and any related amendments to obtain an understanding of the contractual requirements and related performance obligations\n- -assessing  costs  incurred  to-date  and  the  relative  progress  toward  satisfying  the  performance obligation(s) of the contract\n- -assessing, if relevant, the estimated costs at completion on similar or predecessor contracts and programs\n- -inquiring of financial and operational personnel of the Company to identify factors that should be considered within the estimated costs at completion or indications of potential management bias\n- -inspecting correspondence, if any, between the Company and the customer regarding actual todate and expected performance\n- -analyzing the sufficiency of the Company's assessment of contract performance risks included within the estimated costs at completion.\n\n## Discount rates used in pension benefit obligation\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  S  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements, t he  Company's  pension  benefit obligation and the associated plan assets were $17.8 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, on December 31, 2021.

The 2021 loss includes a reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million, abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX of $1,887 million, and abnormal production costs related to the 787 program of $468 million resulting from continued production issues, inspections and rework, partially offset by higher 737 MAX deliveries. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million and additional drivers as noted in the paragraph below.\n\nBCA loss from operations was $13,847 million in 2020 compared with $6,657 million in 2019. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,  $2,567  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  related  to  737  MAX,  $623  million  of  severance  cost,  $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  in  the  first  half  of  2020  from  the  temporary  suspension  of  operations  in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction  in  the  accounting  quantity  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  also  contributed  to  lower  earnings.  The  2019  loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nLower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.\n\n## Backlog\n\nOur  total  backlog  represents  the  estimated  transaction  prices  on  unsatisfied  and  partially  satisfied  performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(Dollars in millions, except per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)\n\nFor an overview of our operating segments, including a discussion of our major products and services, see the Business  discussion  contained  in  Item  1.  The  following  discussion  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of operations  for  2021  compared  with  2020  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  Consolidated  Financial Statements included in Item 8, while a discussion of 2020 compared with 2019 can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n## GLOBAL PANDEMIC UPDATE\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities since March 2020. During this time, we have continued to conduct our operations while responding to the pandemic with actions to mitigate adverse consequences to our employees, business, supply chain and customers. Consistent with our prioritization of the health and safety of our employees, we continue to encourage and promote vaccination across the company. Any long-term impact to our business is currently unknown  due  to  the  uncertainty  around  the  pandemic's  duration  and  its  broader  impact.  For  additional information, see the Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.\n\nThe  United  States  and  other  governments  have  taken  several  steps  to  respond  to  the  pandemic.  On September 9, 2021, the president signed Executive Order 14042, initiating a process whereby covered federal contractors and subcontractors must implement federally required vaccine mandates. A clause implementing the federal  contractor  vaccine  mandate  has  been  incorporated  into  a  number  of  our  federal  contracts.  In  light  of certain court orders, however, the Office of Management and Budget has stated that the U.S. government will not take action to enforce this clause until further notice. If ultimately upheld, this federal contract requirement may  affect  various  business  units  differently.  We  are  working  closely  with  our  customer  to  ensure  that  we minimize disruptions  and  potential  employee  attrition  in  the  event  that  applicable  contract  modifications  are enforceable and as additional modifications are received that could trigger implementation. To the extent that we  or  our  subcontractors  experience  employee  attrition  and/or  work  stoppages,  our  costs  could  increase, schedules could slip on affected programs and our ability to perform under some contracts could be negatively affected, particularly in those instances where we cannot receive cost reimbursement.\n\nOur Aerospace segment's operating results have experienced the most significant impact from the pandemic. New  aircraft  deliveries  in  2021  reflected  our  decision  in  2020  to  reduce  production  rates  to  accommodate supply chain challenges and reduced demand due to the pandemic. However, aircraft demand has been strong in 2021,  with  orders  reaching  their  highest  level  in  over  a  decade.  Similarly,  demand  for  aircraft  services  has improved as air travel has increased, but remains below pre-pandemic levels in some regions of the world. Our U.S. government business continues to experience some disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in  our  Technologies  segment.  The  Review  of  Operating  Segments  includes  additional  information  on  the impacts of the pandemic for the affected segments.",

Deliveries  of  the  737  MAX  were suspended following these orders. Deliveries in the U.S. resumed in late 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding  order.  In  addition,  several  other  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities,  including  the  Brazilian  National  Civil Aviation Agency,  Transport  Canada,  and  the  European  Union Aviation  Safety Agency  have  subsequently  approved return of operations, allowing us to resume deliveries in those jurisdictions. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued an airworthiness directive in the fourth quarter of 2021 outlining actions required for airlines to return to service. We expect 737 MAX deliveries to China to resume in 2022, subject to final regulatory approvals, although risk remains around  the  timing  and  rate  of  those  deliveries.  Over  185  countries  have  approved  the  resumption  of  737  MAX operations. The 737 MAX remains grounded in a small number of non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nWe have gradually increased production rates in 2020 and 2021 and continue to expect to increase the production rate to 31 per month by early 2022, as well as implement further gradual production rate increases in subsequent periods based on market demand and supply chain capacity.\n\nWe produced at abnormally low production rates in 2020 and 2021 and expensed abnormal production costs of $1,887 and $2,567 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We do not expect the remaining abnormal costs related to the 737 MAX to be significant and expect most of the remainder to be incurred in early 2022.\n\nIn 2021, we delivered 245 aircraft. We have approximately 335 airplanes in inventory as of December 31, 2021 and we anticipate  delivering  most  of  these  aircraft  by  the  end  of  2023.  We  continue  to  work  with  customers  who  have requested  to  defer  deliveries  or  to  cancel  orders  for  737  MAX  aircraft,  and  we  are  remarketing  and/or  delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in China  and/or  ramp  up  deliveries  consistent  with  our  assumptions,  our  expectation  of  delivery  timing  and  our expectation regarding future gradual production rate increases could be impacted.",

      "question": "How does Caterpillar's allocation of credit facility access to ME&T compare with Honeywell's reliance on existing cash balances during the pandemic, given their different approaches to liquidity risk management?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar allocated $2.75 billion of its $10.50 billion credit facility to ME&T as of December 31, 2021, with specific tranches expiring in 2022, 2024, and 2026, indicating a structured approach to liquidity support for ME&T. In contrast, Honeywell highlighted its potential reliance on existing cash balances as a key contingency during the pandemic, should cash flow from operations be disrupted. Caterpillar emphasized its $9.25 billion cash and cash equivalents as part of its liquidity strategy, while Honeywell framed existing cash balances as a fallback in the event of continued revenue declines due to pandemic-related customer and operations risks. This reflects Caterpillar\u2019s proactive credit facility segmentation versus Honeywell\u2019s reactive contingency planning.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe  receive  debt  ratings  from  the  major  credit  rating  agencies.  Moody's,  Fitch  and  S&amp;P  maintain  a  'mid-A'  debt  rating.  A downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, ME&amp;T's operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our committed credit facilities. Our Financial Products' operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial, and  potential  borrowings  from  Caterpillar.  In  addition,  we  maintain  a  support  agreement  with  Cat  Financial,  which  requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios.\n\nWe facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs (the 'Programs') through participating financial institutions. The Programs are  available  to  a  wide  range  of  suppliers  and  allows  them  the  option  to  manage  their  cash  flow.  We  are  not  a  party  to  the agreements  between  the  participating  financial  institutions  and  the  suppliers  in  connection  with  the  Programs.  The  range  of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the Programs. The amounts payable to participating financial institutions for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the Programs and included in accounts payable in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position were $822 million and $533 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The amounts settled through the Programs and paid to participating financial institutions were $4.1 billion and $3.2 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We account for payments made under the Programs, the same as our other accounts payable, as a reduction to our cash flows from operations. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.\n\n## Material cash requirements for contractual obligations\n\nWe believe our balances of cash and cash equivalents of $9.25 billion and time deposits of $964 million as of December 31, 2021, along  with  cash  generated  by  ongoing  operations  and  continued  access  to  debt  markets,  will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy  our  cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nWe have committed cash outflow related to postretirement benefit obligations, long-term debt and operating lease agreements. See Notes 12, 14 and 20, respectively, of Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for additional information.\n\nWe have short-term obligations related to the purchase of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. These consist of invoices received and recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2021, but scheduled for payment in 2022 of $8.15 billion. In addition,  we  have  contractual  obligations  for  material  and  services  on  order  at  December  31,  2021,  but  not  yet  invoiced  or delivered, of $7.28 billion.\n\nWe also have long-term contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements; systems support, software licenses and development  contracts;  information  technology  consulting  contracts  and  outsourcing  contracts  for  benefit  plan  administration. These obligations total $1.16 billion, with $550 million due in the next 12 months.\n\n## Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation\n\nNet  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  was  $7.18  billion  in  2021,  compared  with  $4.05  billion  in  2020.  The  increase  was primarily  due  to  higher  profit  in  2021  adjusted  for  non-cash  items,  which  included  higher  accruals  for  short-term  incentive compensation. In addition, lower payments for short-term incentive compensation favorably impacted cash flow. Partially offsetting these items were increased working capital requirements. Within working capital, changes in inventory and accounts receivable unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2021 was $1.23 billion, compared with net cash used of $1.34 billion in 2020. The change was  primarily  due  to  increased  activity  related  to  intercompany  lending  with  Financial  Products,  mostly  offset  by  increased investments in securities. During 2021, we invested $1.19 billion in bank time deposits with varying maturity dates within one year and received proceeds from time deposits that matured of $225 million. We also acquired the Oil &amp; Gas division of the Weir Group PLC for $359 million, net of cash acquired in February 2021.\n\nNet cash used for financing activities during 2021 was $6.30 billion, compared with net cash used of $1.18 billion in 2020. The change was primarily due to the repayment of debt and lower proceeds from the issuance of debt. In addition, we repurchased $2.67 billion of Caterpillar common stock in 2021 compared to $1.13 billion in 2020.",

          "chunk_text": "Risks  arising  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  impacting  our  business  and  that  may  continue  to  impact  our  business,  financial condition, results of operations and prospects include, among other things:\n\n- Customer  Risk -Existing  and  potential  customers  and  their  end-users  may  continue  to  take  actions  to  reduce  or  suspend operations,  reduce  or  delay  spending,  cancel  contracts,  or  cut  costs  in  a  manner  that  reduces  demand  for  our  products  and services.  In  particular,  lower  demand  for  air  travel  may  continue  to  cause  our  customers  to  delay  or  suspend  spending  in connection with the manufacturing, repair, overhaul or servicing of aircraft, and there may be long-term deterioration in demand for air travel that could impact our business beyond the current COVID-19 health crisis. Customers may also continue to attempt to  renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, face financial constraints on their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis or at all, or enter into bankruptcy or discontinue their business operations, and we may continue to be required to discount the pricing of our products. In addition, unfavorable customer site conditions, such as closure of or access restrictions to customer facilities,  and  disruptions  to  our  customers'  third-party  logistics,  warehousing,  inventory  management,  and  distribution  services may continue to limit our ability to sell products, meet billing milestones, or provide services.\n- Operations Risk -The closure of our facilities, restrictions inhibiting our employees' ability to access those facilities, materials and labor shortages, and disruptions to the ability of our suppliers or service providers to deliver goods or services to us (including as a result of supplier facility closures or access restrictions, disruptions to their supply chains, and supplier liquidity or bankruptcy risk) could further disrupt our ability to provide our services and solutions and result in, among other things, higher costs which may not be recoverable under customer contracts, claims for liquidated damages in the event of delays, terminations of customer contracts and losses of revenue. Because the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings,  liquidity,  and  cash  flows,  we  have  taken  and  may  be  required  to  redeploy  significant  cost  actions,  including  but  not limited to reducing discretionary expenses (such as non-essential travel, contractors, and consultants), reducing hiring, canceling annual merit increases, reducing executive and board of director pay, reducing work schedules across the enterprise, shortening or staggering work schedules to match production with demand, and reducing staffing levels, as well as increasing supplier-based productivity and enhancing spending-limit controls. However, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not currently ascertainable; also, our costs may not decrease at the same pace as revenue declines as many of our costs are less variable in nature, and we may not be able to or may not choose to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term  outlook  and  growth  opportunities.  Further,  our  management  of  the  impact  of  COVID-19  will  continue  to  require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our global enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments, which may adversely impact our future results of operations. Issues relating to the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  also  result  in  legal  claims  or  litigation  against  us.  In  addition,  remote  work  has  increased  the frequency of cybersecurity attacks, including phishing, and malware attempts that utilize COVID-19-related strategies, increasing the risk of a material cybersecurity incident that could result in the loss of proprietary or personal data, render us more vulnerable to future cybersecurity attacks, disrupt our operations, or otherwise cause us reputational or financial harm.\n- Liquidity and Cash Flow Risk -Because of the customer and operations risks described above, our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may need to use existing cash balances to service our debt, and if such balances are insufficient, then we may be required to engage in one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring of existing debt, issuing new debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.\n\nDue to the changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to curb its spread, we cannot predict the ultimate impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow. Any recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors. In addition, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that may occur in the future. Further, many of the factors disclosed under Risk Factors in this Form 10-K are, and we anticipate will continue to be further, heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the COVID19 pandemic.\n\n## A significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.\n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company's sales. Risks related to international operations  include  exchange  control  regulations,  wage  and  price  controls,  antitrust  regulations,  employment  regulations,  foreign investment  laws,  import,  export  and  other  trade  restrictions  (such  as  sanctions  and  embargoes),  differing  levels  of  protection  of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate such risk), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability  and  uncertainties  arising  from  the  global  geopolitical  environment  and  the  evolving  international  and  domestic political,  regulatory, and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, including sanctions and trade barriers, and trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.",

      "answer": "RTX's nonqualified domestic pension obligations account for 3% of its total pension projected benefit obligation (PBO) as of December 31, 2023, indicating a relatively small but still present liability that supplements retirement benefits beyond IRS qualified plan limits. These obligations are part of RTX's broader pension liabilities, which are significant but partially offset by plan assets. In contrast, GD's lease liabilities include operating and finance leases with weighted-average remaining terms of 11.8 years and 14.3 years respectively as of December 31, 2023, discounted at 4%. These lease obligations represent long-term fixed commitments that will impact GD's liquidity and leverage ratios over time. While RTX's nonqualified pension obligations are a smaller component of its overall pension exposure, GD's lease liabilities are recurring and long-dated, suggesting different types of financial flexibility constraints for each company depending on their capital structure and off-balance-sheet commitments.",

In contrast, HON plans to use a higher expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% for 2024, which represents an increase from the prior year assumption.

      "answer": "CAT's Financial Products Segment reported a 27% year-over-year increase in operating profit in 2021, indicating strong performance in its financial services arm. This contrasts with BA's Commercial Airplanes business, which faces significant profit volatility due to production disruptions, supply chain quality issues, and regulatory challenges\u2014such as those seen in the 737 MAX and 787 programs. While CAT leverages its Financial Products Segment (which had $248 million in operating profit in Q4 2021) to support earnings stability, BA's reliance on commercial aircraft deliveries makes it more vulnerable to external shocks, such as delivery delays and customer contract remedies. This highlights a structural difference in how the two companies manage earnings volatility within the broader aerospace and industrial sector.",

Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\n\nWe  derive  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  from  a  limited  number  of  commercial  airlines. We  can  make  no assurance  that  any  customer  will  exercise  purchase  options,  fulfill  existing  purchase  commitments  or  purchase additional  products  or  services  from  us.  In  addition,  fleet  decisions,  airline  consolidations  or  financial  challenges involving  any  of  our  major  commercial  airline  customers  could  significantly  reduce  our  revenues  and  limit  our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n\nOur Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specification, achieve planned production rate  targets,  successfully  develop  new  aircraft  or  new  derivative  aircraft,  and  meet  or  exceed  stringent performance and reliability standards.\n\nThe commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S.  suppliers,  highly-skilled  labor  from  thousands  of  employees  and  other  partners,  and  stringent  regulatory requirements,  including  the  risk  of  evolving  standards  for  commercial  aircraft  certification,  and  performance  and reliability standards. The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the implementation of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, among them changing the process for certification of commercial aircraft. Comparable agencies that regulate similar matters in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or other similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. The 737 program experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of commercial operations of the 737 MAX aircraft by civil aviation  authorities around the globe. 737 MAX deliveries resumed in late 2020 and early 2021 upon approval of the FAA and other nonU.S. civil aviation authorities. During 2020 and 2021, we experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries, including a pause in 787 deliveries since May 2021. During 2021, this  resulted  in  reprioritizing  production  resources  to  support  inspections  and  rework.  We  continue  to  conduct inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries as well as rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the  contractual  delivery  date.  The  regulators  will  ultimately  determine  the  timing  and  conditions  for  resuming  787 deliveries. Delays on the 737 MAX, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\n\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to  adjust  production  rates  on  several  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs.  During  2021,  we  reprioritized  production resources to support inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft. The 787 program is currently producing at very low rates and expects that to continue until deliveries resume. We are also continuing to implement changes in the production  process  designed  to  ensure  that  newly-built  airplanes  meet  our  specifications  and  do  not  require  further inspections  and  rework.  In  addition,  we  continue  to  seek  opportunities  to  reduce  the  costs  of  building  our  aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory.

      "question": "How does the R&D investment by GE in its Power segment compare to the credit risk exposure Cat Financial identifies in its Power-related financing portfolio, and how might Caterpillar's financial support agreement with Cat Financial mitigate these risks?",
      "answer": "GE invested $319 million in 2023 in its Power segment, reflecting its focus on advancing power generation technologies. Cat Financial, in its 2023 report, specifically identifies Power as a distinct class of finance receivables related to Caterpillar's electrical power generation, gas compression, and co-generation systems. Cat Financial assesses credit risk in this segment using loss forecast models that consider probabilities of default and estimated loss given default, adjusted for economic conditions. Caterpillar maintains a support agreement with Cat Financial that may require Caterpillar to make payments if Cat Financial fails to maintain certain financial ratios, potentially mitigating the credit risk exposure in the Power-related financing portfolio. This creates a three-way linkage where GE's R&D investment in Power may influence the broader market adoption of power generation systems, which in turn affects Cat Financial's credit exposure and Caterpillar's financial obligations under the support agreement.",

      "question": "How does UPS's $1.3 billion in 2023 acquisitions within Supply Chain Solutions contrast with FDX's exposure to goodwill impairment charges, given that UPS has cumulatively recorded $1.2 billion in such charges within that segment while FDX has faced material impairments historically?",
      "answer": "UPS invested $1.3 billion in 2023 to acquire businesses like Happy Returns and MNX Global Logistics, integrating them into its Supply Chain Solutions segment. Despite no goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2022 or 2021, UPS has cumulatively recognized $1.2 billion in goodwill impairments in that segment. Meanwhile, FDX has previously incurred material goodwill impairment charges from past acquisitions and acknowledges the risk of future impairments. This contrast highlights differing historical outcomes of acquisition strategies, with both companies facing inherent risks in realizing expected value from their Supply Chain investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS \u2192 Supply Chain Solutions: UPS spent $1.3 billion in 2023 on acquisitions like Happy Returns and MNX Global Logistics, which are integrated into the Supply Chain Solutions segment.",

        "Hop 3: Goodwill Impairment Charges \u2190 FDX: FDX has previously incurred material goodwill impairment charges from acquisitions and faces ongoing risk of future impairments, indicating a history of value erosion in similar segments."

(a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

      "question": "How does the 1% exposure to U.S. exports in Honeywell's Safety and Productivity Solutions segment compare to Emerson's 33% growth in U.S. exports, and what implications might this have for their respective international sales strategies?",
      "answer": "Honeywell's Safety and Productivity Solutions segment reported only 1% of its sales as U.S. exports in 2021, indicating limited reliance on this channel for international revenue. In contrast, Emerson reported a 33% increase in U.S. exports in 2022, reaching $1.5 billion, driven by acquisitions and organic growth in its Commercial & Residential Solutions business. This divergence suggests that Emerson is leveraging U.S. exports more aggressively as part of its international sales strategy, while Honeywell\u2019s Safety and Productivity Solutions segment relies more heavily on non-U.S. manufacturing and local market delivery. The difference in exposure may reflect distinct geographic footprints or strategic priorities in how each company approaches international markets.",

U.S. exports of $1.5 billion were up 33 percent compared with 2021, including an increase of approximately $200 due to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. Underlying international destination sales were up 6 percent, as foreign currency translation had a 5 percent unfavorable impact on the comparison, the AspenTech acquisition added 2 percent and the Therm-O-Disc divestiture subtracted 1 percent. Underlying sales increased 2 percent in Europe, 5 percent in Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa (China up 7 percent), 19 percent in Latin America and 15 percent in Canada. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $9.2 billion in 2022, down 1 percent compared with 2021.\n\nInternational destination sales, including U.S. exports, increased 10 percent, to $10.3 billion in 2021, reflecting increases in both the Automation Solutions and Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions businesses. U.S. exports of $1.1 billion were up 12 percent compared with 2020. Underlying international destination sales were up 5 percent, as foreign currency translation had a 4 percent favorable impact on the comparison and the OSI acquisition added 1 percent.

Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $9.3 billion in 2021, up 9 percent compared with 2020.\n\n## ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\nPortfolio management is an integral component of Emerson's growth and value creation strategy. Over the past 18 months, Emerson has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and divestitures of non-core businesses. These actions were undertaken to create a higher growth and cohesive industrial technology portfolio as a global automation leader serving a diversified set of end markets with differentiated capabilities in intelligent devices and software. The Company's recent portfolio actions include the following transactions.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in fiscal 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone (\"Blackstone\") in a transaction valued at $14.0 billion. Emerson will receive upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.5 billion and a note of $2.25 billion at close (which will accrue 5 percent interest payable in kind by capitalizing interest), while retaining a 45 percent noncontrolling common equity ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The Climate Technologies business, which includes the Copeland compressor business and the entire portfolio of products and services across all residential and commercial HVAC and refrigeration end-markets, had fiscal 2022 net sales of approximately $5.0 billion and pretax earnings of $1.0 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The Company expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $10 billion (approximately $8 billion after-tax) in fiscal 2023 upon the completion of the transaction.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion. This business had net sales of $630 and pretax earnings of $152 in fiscal 2022 and is reported in the Tools &amp; Home Products segment. The assets and liabilities of InSinkErator were classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2022 and are included in other current assets, other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $2.8 billion (approximately $2.1 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nOn May 16, 2022, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"Heritage AspenTech\") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectively, the 'Emerson Industrial Software Business'), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (hereinafter referred to as \"AspenTech\"). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson beneficially owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis) and former Heritage AspenTech stockholders owned the remaining outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock. AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's previous name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under Heritage AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.' On a pro forma basis, AspenTech had fiscal 2022 net sales of $1.1 billion.",

      "answer": "RTX faces significant program margin pressures due to its reliance on U.S. government contracts, where risks such as contract termination for convenience, funding delays, and cost overruns on fixed-price contracts like FFP and FPI can negatively impact profitability. These risks are amplified in development programs with unproven technologies and undefinitized contract actions that may result in unfavorable final terms. In contrast, BA\u2019s BCA segment faced margin pressures from specific program losses, including a $6,493 million reach-forward loss on the 777X program in 2020 and a $3,460 million reach-forward loss on the 787 program in 2021, driven by production issues and the impact of the pandemic. While both companies experienced margin compression, RTX\u2019s risks stem from external government contracting dynamics, whereas BA\u2019s were internally driven by execution challenges on major commercial aircraft programs.",

Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nWe Face Risks Relating to Our U.S. Government Contracts and the Mix of Our U.S. Government Contracts and Programs that Could Negatively Impact our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. The termination of one or more of our contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages,  or  contract  definitization  delays,  could  negatively  impact  our  competitive  position,  results  of  operations,  financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without  prior  notice,  at  the  U.S.  government's  convenience  or  for  default  based  on  performance.  If  one  of  our  contracts  is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some contracts and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination  of  any  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  because  the  funding  of  U.S.  government  programs  is  subject  to  congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for  convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve  the  development,  application  and  manufacture  of  advanced  defense  and  technology  systems  and  products  aimed  at achieving  challenging  goals.  New  technologies  may  be  untested  or  unproven  and  in  some  instances,  product  requirements  or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns or product failures, and could divert our attention or resources from other projects. Our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investments may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for these awards.\n\nOur U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but  we  are  generally  not  reimbursed  for  unauthorized  costs  exceeding  a  cost  ceiling  amount  or  costs  not  allowable  under  the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are  typically  cost  reimbursable,  they  can  be  FFP  or  FPI,  which  can  significantly  increase  our  risk  of  a  potential  negative  profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to  future  unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards certain prototypes, research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracts during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract  cost  sharing  (e.g.,  one-third  of  program  costs).  They  may  also  require  non-traditional  subcontractor  participation  and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. Moreover, from time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability. In addition, as discussed more fully below, our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S.",

BCA's loss in 2020 also reflects the absence of MAX deliveries during the first three quarters of the year, lower widebody  deliveries  and  lower  program  margins  resulting  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  787  production  issues, abnormal  production  costs,  737NG  frame  fitting  component  repair  costs,  severance  costs  and  737  MAX  customer considerations.\n\nThe loss in 2019 primarily reflects  the  absence  of  737  MAX  deliveries  in  the  second,  third  and  fourth  quarters  and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins.

      "answer": "LMT faces significant financial exposure from joint venture guarantees ($838 million at year-end 2021) and standby letters of credit ($781 million expected to renew), which could negatively impact profit if counterparties underperform. CAT's Resource Industries segment reported $305 million in profit for Q4 2021, but rising SG&A expenses and cost pressures (including higher freight and material costs) were already compressing margins from 12.5% to 11.0% of sales. If CAT were exposed to similar contractual risks\u2014such as through joint ventures or long-term fixed-price contracts with cost overruns\u2014its ability to sustain or grow profitability could be further challenged, especially in a capital-intensive segment that already reported $403 million in annual depreciation costs. This suggests that companies with complex contractual obligations and exposure to cost volatility may face amplified profit risks in segments like Resource Industries.",

(a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  higher  sales  volume,  driven  by higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  aftermarket  parts,  and  favorable  price  realization.  End-user  demand  was  higher  in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $32 million, or 12 percent, compared with $273 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Increased manufacturing costs and SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were more than offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, and material costs.\n\nThe increase in SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses was driven by investments aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor, and higher shortterm incentive compensation expense.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 11.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n## Energy &amp; Transportation\n\n",

As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.\n\nFor more information, see the 'Income Taxes' section of this MD&amp;A and Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS\n\nOur self-insurance reserves are established for estimates of ultimate loss on all incurred claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. Components of our self-insurance reserves included in this critical accounting estimate are workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. These reserves are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. These estimates include judgment about severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. The use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years.\n\nWe believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, insurance retention levels, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities and affect our results of operations. Self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet for the period ended May 31 are as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Caterpillar reported a $188 million deferred tax liability in 2021 due to foreign exchange translation, up from $147 million in 2020, indicating a significant impact of currency fluctuations on its tax position. Meanwhile, 3M's Safety and Industrial segment saw a 2.0 percentage point increase in sales growth from translation effects in 2021, contributing to its total 9.8% sales growth. This shows that while translation creates financial reporting volatility for Caterpillar through tax liabilities, it positively contributed to revenue growth for 3M\u2019s Safety and Industrial business.",

      "answer": "RTX faces margin pressure due to high inflation levels that have increased material, component, and labor costs, which it cannot always offset on fixed-price contracts, particularly in its government and commercial aerospace businesses. This exposure is highlighted in RTX's 2023 10-K, where it notes that cost overruns on fixed-price contracts could result in losses. In contrast, Caterpillar (CAT) experiences margin pressure from competitive pricing in its global markets, where price discounting is common, especially outside the U.S. where certain competitors have regional advantages. CAT's 2023 10-K notes that such pricing intensity directly impacts its operating profit, though it does not face the same contractual structure-driven exposure as RTX.",

      "answer": "UPS used a cash balance interest credit rate of 2.50% in 2022 for its U.S. Pension Benefits, which is lower than the 2.90% interest cost discount rate applied to those same benefits. This difference suggests a potential mismatch between credited returns and the discount rate assumption, which could affect pension expense calculations. In contrast, FDX reported a net unfunded status of $2,732 million for its U.S. Pension Benefits in 2022, indicating significant underfunding that may amplify the impact of these rate assumptions on its financial obligations.",

In contrast, CAT\u2019s Resource Industries profit rose 12% year-over-year to $305 million, despite facing higher manufacturing costs, including variable labor, freight, and material expenses. CAT offset these rising costs through higher sales volume and favorable price realization.

          "chunk_text": "## For the year ended December 31, 2021, segment revenues were down $0.7 billion (3%) and segment profit was up $1.7 billion.\n\nRPO as of December 31, 2021 increased $11.2 billion (10%) from December 31, 2020, due to increases in both equipment and services. Equipment increased primarily due to an increase in Military orders. Services increased primarily as a result of engines contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service.\n\nRevenues decreased $0.7 billion (3%) organically*. Commercial Engines revenues decreased, due to 233 fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including fewer engine shipments on legacy programs, partially offset by 30 more LEAP units versus the prior year. Commercial Services revenues increased, primarily due to increased shop visit volume, partially offset by lower volume on commercial spare part shipments, as prior year revenues included significant spare part shipments prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Commercial Services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, included a net unfavorable change in estimated profitability of $0.3 billion for its long-term service agreements compared to a net unfavorable change of $1.1 billion for the prior year. Military revenues decreased due to lower services and 130 fewer engine shipments, partially offset by product mix.\n\nProfit increased $1.6 billion organically*, primarily due to increased shop visit volume and the receipt of a payment from a partner associated with engine program activity. Profit also increased due to lower net unfavorable changes in estimated profitability in longterm service agreements, as the prior year included charges reflecting the cumulative COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts of changes to billing and cost assumptions for certain long-term service agreements; operational cost reduction from the actions taken in 2020 and the first half of 2021; and the nonrecurrence of prior year charges related to lower commercial engine production volumes, customer credit risk and an impairment charge in a joint venture in the Systems business. These increases in profit were partially offset by an accrual for a contract in a loss position in the long-term service agreement portfolio.\n\nHEALTHCARE. Healthcare provides essential healthcare technologies to developed and emerging markets and has expertise in medical imaging, digital solutions, patient monitoring and diagnostics, drug discovery and performance improvement solutions that are the building blocks of precision health. Products and services are sold worldwide primarily to hospitals and medical facilities.\n\nHealthcare Systems (HCS) - develops, manufactures, markets and services a broad suite of products and solutions used in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients that is encompassed in imaging, ultrasound, life care solutions and enterprise software and solutions. Imaging includes magnetic resonance, computed tomography, molecular imaging, x-ray systems and complementary software and services, for use in general diagnostics, women's health and image-guided therapies.

It delivered products, services and manufacturing solutions for drug discovery, biopharmaceutical production, and cellular and gene therapy technologies.\n\nCompetition &amp; Regulation. Healthcare competes with a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers and services providers. Customers require products and services that allow them to provide better access to healthcare, improve the affordability of care and improve the quality of patient outcomes. Key factors affecting competition include technological innovations, productivity solutions, competitive pricing and the ability to provide lifecycle services. New technologies and solutions could make our products and services obsolete unless we continue to develop new and improved offerings. Our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, as well as laws and regulations that apply to various reimbursement systems or other government funded healthcare programs.\n\nSignificant Trends &amp; Developments. We continue to see an overall recovery in hospital spending; the expectation is that this will continue in line with the worldwide COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Both HCS and PDx demand has recovered to at or above pre-pandemic levels. Similar to many industries, we are experiencing inflation in our supply chain as well as delays in sourcing key materials needed for our products, such as electronics and resins, delaying our ability to convert RPO to revenue. We have proactively managed sourcing and logistics, material and design costs to partially mitigate supply chain impacts. In response to near-term volatility and cost pressures, we have continued to execute on structural cost reductions and cash optimization actions, in order to invest in growth and research and development.\n\nWe continue to grow and invest in precision health, with focus on creating new products and digital solutions as well as expanding uses of existing offerings that are tailored to the different needs of our global customers. We introduced the Vscan Air in over 70 countries, a cutting edge wireless pocket-sized ultrasound that is differentiated by its crystal clear image quality, whole-body scanning capabilities, and intuitive software. We continue to see the broader application of our AIR Recon DL technology, which provides best in class image quality as well as substantially reduced scan time. An example of a new product that includes AIR Recon DL is the SIGNA Hero magnetic resonance imaging system that helps accommodate more patients of all shapes and sizes, offering a 70 cm bore and detachable table for enhanced patient comfort. We introduced the Revolution APEX CT, which has a modular and scalable design to do in-room upgrades on the detector without swapping the gantry, giving customers the flexibility to right size their purchase today and be ready for the future. We remain committed to innovate and invest to create more integrated, efficient, and personalized precision healthcare.",

The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  higher  sales  volume,  driven  by higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  aftermarket  parts,  and  favorable  price  realization.  End-user  demand  was  higher  in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $32 million, or 12 percent, compared with $273 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Increased manufacturing costs and SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were more than offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, and material costs.\n\nThe increase in SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses was driven by investments aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor, and higher shortterm incentive compensation expense.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 11.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n## Energy &amp; Transportation\n\n",

      "answer": "UPS's volume declines, driven by inflationary pressures, changes in consumer behavior, and labor negotiations, signal a broader market softness that likely contributed to FedEx Express's own volume declines, which were cited as a primary factor in FedEx Express's 4% revenue drop in 2024. These shared volume challenges prompted FedEx to take strategic actions, including permanently retiring 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft and recording a $157 million noncash impairment charge tied to its Express segment, as part of a larger effort to modernize its fleet and align capacity with current and anticipated shipment volumes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS \u2192 Volume Declines: UPS disclosed a decrease in average daily volume across residential and commercial segments, citing inflationary pressures, consumer behavior changes, and labor negotiations as key causes, with expectations of flat growth in early 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Volume Declines \u2192 FedEx Express: FedEx Express reported a 4% revenue decline in 2024, directly attributing this to volume declines, lower fuel surcharges, and reduced demand surcharges, indicating a shared sensitivity to macroeconomic and volume trends.",
        "Hop 3: FedEx Express \u2190 FDX: FedEx (FDX) made strategic decisions in response to these volume trends, including permanently retiring 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft and recording a $157 million noncash impairment charge specifically tied to its Express segment, reflecting a direct operational response to declining shipment volumes."

      "answer": "CAT's Resource Industries segment reported a $403 million depreciation expense in 2021, which contributed to its overall operating costs. Despite this, the segment achieved a $1.291 billion profit, driven by higher sales volume and favorable pricing, indicating strong revenue growth and cost management. In contrast, LMT's fixed-price contracts expose it to profit volatility, as deviations from cost estimates directly affect profitability, with no explicit depreciation or profit figures disclosed but clear risk tied to cost overruns. This suggests CAT's Resource Industries has more predictable cost structures and profitability, while LMT faces greater financial risk on large fixed-price contracts.",

The increase was due to higher sales volume driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. End-user demand was higher in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. Dealers decreased inventories more during 2020 than during 2021.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $1.291 billion in 2021, an increase of $395 million, or 44 percent, compared with $896 million in 2020.  The  increase  was  mainly  due  to  higher  sales  volume  and  favorable  price  realization,  partially  offset  by  unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, as well as higher material and period manufacturing costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of cost absorption. Higher period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased during 2021, compared with a decrease during 2020.\n\nHigher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were driven primarily by higher short-term incentive compensation expense and investments aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor costs.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 13.0 percent for 2021, compared with 11.3 percent for 2020.\n\n## Energy &amp; Transportation\n\n",

(a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

      "answer": "RTX's CAS-based pension expense recognition mechanism differs from BA's FAS/CAS adjustment approach, resulting in distinct impacts on non-GAAP metrics. RTX recovers CAS pension expenses through U.S. government contract pricing, with the difference between CAS and FAS service cost recorded as a FAS/CAS operating adjustment. In 2024, BA reported a $1,104 million FAS/CAS service cost adjustment that negatively impacted its non-GAAP core operating loss of $11,811 million. While RTX's 2024 filing doesn't specify the exact FAS/CAS adjustment amount, its disclosure indicates this adjustment is primarily driven by demographic or economic experience changes and assumption updates, similar to BA's adjustment factors.",

Eliminations and other operating profit in 2023 was relatively consistent with 2022.\n\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $0.7 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to a $0.9 billion charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters recorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $0.2 billion benefit from a tax  related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $43 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to the LTAMDS program, which are included in the Raytheon segment beginning in 2023, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our segment realignment in 2023, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.\n\n## FAS/CAS operating adjustment\n\nThe segment results of Raytheon include pension and PRB expense as determined under U.S. government CAS, which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The difference between our CAS expense and the FAS service cost attributable to these segments under U.S. GAAP is the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment results in consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally include FAS service cost.\n\nThe CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension ex pense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost and amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded on a CAS basis. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly.",

The HAWC program is a joint Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and U.S. Air Force effort that seeks to develop and demonstrate critical technologies to enable an effective and affordable air-launched hypersonic cruise missile.\n\n## Other Matters Relating to Our Business\n\nAs worldwide businesses,  our  operations  can  be  affected  by  a  variety  of  economic,  industry  and  other  factors,  including  those described in this section, in Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' in Item 1, 'Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,' and in Item 1A, 'Risk Factors' in this Form 10-K.\n\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, and the industries in which we operate. Government, business and individual actions in response to COVID-19 have resulted in continued disruption to air travel and commercial activities and significant restrictions and limitations on businesses, particularly  within  the  aerospace  and  commercial  airline  industries. While  commercial  air  travel  in  certain  areas appears to be recovering, it continues to lag in other areas and remains below pre-pandemic levels.

      "answer": "CAT's non-accrual with an allowance in the Power segment increased from $5 million in 2022 to $8 million in 2023, indicating a growing concern over credit risk in that segment. In contrast, GE's R&D investment in its Power segment rose from $299 million (GE-funded) in 2022 to $319 million in 2023, showing a strategic focus on innovation in the same sector. This suggests that while CAT is facing increasing financial risk in its Power segment, GE is doubling down on R&D to drive growth and competitiveness.",

      "question": "How does the $118 million in capitalized interest amortization disclosed by UPS in 2023 influence its interest coverage ratio, and how might this compare in financial risk significance to Caterpillar's minimum interest coverage ratio requirement under its debt covenants?",
      "answer": "UPS disclosed $118 million in capitalized interest amortization for 2023, which is added back to income when calculating the interest coverage ratio, as defined by Chevron\u2019s methodology. This metric reflects the company\u2019s ability to service debt by incorporating both interest expense and amortization of capitalized interest into the calculation. Meanwhile, Caterpillar is subject to a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant, calculated as profit excluding income taxes, interest expense, and net gain (loss) from interest rate derivatives divided by interest expense. A lower interest coverage ratio\u2014impacted by factors such as higher amortized interest\u2014could bring Caterpillar closer to breaching its covenant, which could trigger adverse financial consequences. Therefore, the $118 million amortization at UPS is a component of its broader interest coverage profile, paralleling the structural importance of this metric in Caterpillar\u2019s debt compliance framework.",

        "Hop 1: UPS \u2192 Amortization of Capitalized Interest: UPS disclosed $118 million in capitalized interest amortization for 2023, indicating a material component of its interest-related financial obligations.",

        "Hop 3: Interest Coverage Ratio \u2190 CAT: Caterpillar is subject to a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant, which is calculated using profit excluding taxes and interest expense, and is critical to maintaining compliance with its debt agreements."

      "question": "How does RTX's foreign exchange hedging strategy in aerospace compare to Emerson's exposure to U.S. export growth, given Honeywell's reported 23% U.S. export sales in the aerospace segment?",
      "answer": "RTX actively hedges its foreign exchange exposure, particularly at Pratt & Whitney Canada and Collins Aerospace, where U.S. Dollar sales are hedged up to 49 months in advance to mitigate currency translation impacts. This is driven by the company\u2019s significant exposure to foreign currencies, especially given that non-U.S. entities incur costs in local currencies. In contrast, Emerson reported a 33% increase in U.S. exports in 2022, indicating growing reliance on export sales which may imply increasing exposure to foreign exchange risk, though the extent of hedging is not disclosed. Honeywell\u2019s data shows that 23% of its aerospace segment sales come from U.S. exports, which provides a benchmark for the industry\u2019s dependence on export markets. Together, these data points suggest that while RTX proactively manages FX risk due to its international cost structure, Emerson\u2019s growing U.S. export exposure may require similar risk management strategies as its international footprint expands.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWithin our aerospace business, our sales are typically denominated in U.S. Dollars. However, for our non-U.S. based entities, such as Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (P&amp;WC), a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies. Consequently, there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as U.S. Dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the Canadian Dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations. Additionally, we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against these other currencies, we hedge a certain portion of sales to secure  the  rates  at  which  U.S.  Dollars  will  be  converted.  The  majority  of  this  hedging  activity  occurs  at  P&amp;WC  and  Collins Aerospace,  and  hedging  activity  also  occurs  to  a  lesser  extent  at  the  remainder  of  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney.  At  P&amp;WC  and  Collins Aerospace,  firm  and  forecasted  sales  for  both  original  equipment  and  spare  parts  are  hedged  at  varying  amounts  for  up  to  49 months  on  the  U.S.  Dollar  sales  exposure  as  represented  by  the  excess  of  U.S.  Dollar  sales  over  U.S.  Dollar  denominated purchases.  Hedging  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  movements  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  are  partially  offset  by  the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. While the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results, there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts, changes in the sales profile, volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk. We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations. A 100 basis points unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate $4 billion impact on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we believe our exposure to interest rate risk on our fixed-rate debt is not material. From time to time, we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures, but may consider such strategies in the future.",

Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $9.3 billion in 2021, up 9 percent compared with 2020.\n\n## ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\nPortfolio management is an integral component of Emerson's growth and value creation strategy. Over the past 18 months, Emerson has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and divestitures of non-core businesses. These actions were undertaken to create a higher growth and cohesive industrial technology portfolio as a global automation leader serving a diversified set of end markets with differentiated capabilities in intelligent devices and software. The Company's recent portfolio actions include the following transactions.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in fiscal 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone (\"Blackstone\") in a transaction valued at $14.0 billion. Emerson will receive upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.5 billion and a note of $2.25 billion at close (which will accrue 5 percent interest payable in kind by capitalizing interest), while retaining a 45 percent noncontrolling common equity ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The Climate Technologies business, which includes the Copeland compressor business and the entire portfolio of products and services across all residential and commercial HVAC and refrigeration end-markets, had fiscal 2022 net sales of approximately $5.0 billion and pretax earnings of $1.0 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The Company expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $10 billion (approximately $8 billion after-tax) in fiscal 2023 upon the completion of the transaction.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion. This business had net sales of $630 and pretax earnings of $152 in fiscal 2022 and is reported in the Tools &amp; Home Products segment. The assets and liabilities of InSinkErator were classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2022 and are included in other current assets, other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $2.8 billion (approximately $2.1 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nOn May 16, 2022, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"Heritage AspenTech\") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectively, the 'Emerson Industrial Software Business'), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (hereinafter referred to as \"AspenTech\"). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson beneficially owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis) and former Heritage AspenTech stockholders owned the remaining outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock. AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's previous name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under Heritage AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.' On a pro forma basis, AspenTech had fiscal 2022 net sales of $1.1 billion.",

      "answer": "LMT reports prepaid pension assets as part of other noncurrent assets when plan assets exceed the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), which was $43.4 billion in 2022 for their qualified pension plans. These prepaid pension assets are included within unallocated assets, as noted in the second hop, which also lists items like cash, deferred taxes, and derivatives. However, UPS's unallocated assets are described as consisting primarily of cash and marketable securities, with no specific mention of prepaid pension assets in their segment reporting. This indicates that while both companies include prepaid pension assets in unallocated assets, LMT explicitly discloses the pension-related component tied to a significant liability, whereas UPS emphasizes liquidity assets in its unallocated category.",

Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. Global small package operations represent our most significant business and are broken down into regional operations around the world. Regional operations managers are responsible for both domestic and export products within their geographic area. Supply Chain Solutions comprises the results of non-reportable operating segments that do not meet the quantitative and qualitative criteria of a reportable segment as defined under ASC Topic 280 - Segment Reporting.\n\n## U.S. Domestic Package\n\nU.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents and packages throughout the United States.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide, including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or destination outside the United States. Our International Package reporting segment includes our operations in Europe, Asia, Americas and ISMEA.\n\n## Supply Chain Solutions\n\nSupply Chain Solutions includes our Forwarding, Logistics, Coyote, Marken, UPS Mail Innovations and other businesses. Our Forwarding, Logistics and UPS Mail Innovations units provide services in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide and include international air and ocean freight forwarding, customs brokerage, distribution and post-sales services, mail and consulting services. Coyote offers truckload brokerage services primarily in the United States. Marken is a global provider of supply chain solutions to the healthcare and life sciences industry, specializing in clinical trials logistics. Other businesses within this segment include The UPS Store, UPS Capital and Roadie. This segment also included UPS Freight prior to its divestiture, details of which are set out in note 4.\n\nIn evaluating financial performance, we focus on operating profit as a segment's measure of profit or loss. Operating profit is before investment income (expense) and other, interest expense and income tax expense. Certain expenses are allocated between the segments using activity-based costing methods as described in Part I, \"Item 7. Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. As we operate an integrated, global multimodal network, we evaluate many of our capital expenditure decisions at a network level. Accordingly, expenditures on property, plant and equipment by segment are not presented. Unallocated assets are comprised primarily of cash and marketable securities.",

      "answer": "The $2.6 billion pension liability in GD's defense segments could impact the estimation of costs at completion for long-term contracts, as pension obligations contribute to labor cost assumptions used in contract forecasting. This is especially relevant given that GD's defense segments reported a total backlog of $6.533 billion in 2021, indicating a large volume of long-term, contractually obligated work that must factor in such liabilities. Meanwhile, EMR experienced a 23% increase in total backlog from $6.533 billion in 2021 to $8.053 billion in 2022, suggesting growing exposure to long-duration contracts that similarly require careful estimation of future costs, including pension obligations. Therefore, both firms face increasing pressure to accurately model long-term liabilities within their contract cost forecasts as backlogs grow.",

          "chunk_text": "## Estimation of costs at completion for select long-term contracts\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  B  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  accounting  for  long-term  contracts involves estimation of the costs to complete a contract in order to accurately recognize the associated revenue.  The  estimated  costs  at  completion  for  each  contract  are  used  to  assess  the  proportion  of revenues to recognize based upon the costs incurred-to-date in comparison to the total estimate of costs to complete the contract.\n\nWe identified the assessment of the estimation of costs at completion for a select group of long-term contracts in the defense segments as a critical audit matter. The estimated costs at completion for the select  group  of  long-term  contracts  incorporates  assumptions,  such  as  labor  hours  and  the  cost  of materials for the work to be performed. The evaluation of one or more of the assumptions used in the estimation of the costs to complete for the select group of contracts required a high level of subjective auditor judgment due to the nature of the individual contracts and related contract performance risks. Specifically,  changes  to  certain  assumptions  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  estimated  revenue recorded during the period.\n\nThe following are primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the estimation of costs at completion for the select group of long-term contracts. This included contract level controls over the estimated cost assumptions. For certain contracts, we compared the Company's historical estimates of  costs  to  actual  costs  incurred  to  assess  the  Company's  ability  to  estimate  accurately.  Based  on  the nature  of  the  individual  contract,  we  evaluated  certain  assumptions  within  the  Company's  estimated costs at completion by:\n\n- -reading the underlying contract and any related amendments to obtain an understanding of the contractual requirements and related performance obligations\n- -assessing  costs  incurred  to-date  and  the  relative  progress  toward  satisfying  the  performance obligation(s) of the contract\n- -assessing, if relevant, the estimated costs at completion on similar or predecessor contracts and programs\n- -inquiring of financial and operational personnel of the Company to identify factors that should be considered within the estimated costs at completion or indications of potential management bias\n- -inspecting correspondence, if any, between the Company and the customer regarding actual todate and expected performance\n- -analyzing the sufficiency of the Company's assessment of contract performance risks included within the estimated costs at completion.\n\n## Discount rates used in pension benefit obligation\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  S  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements, t he  Company's  pension  benefit obligation and the associated plan assets were $17.8 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, on December 31, 2021. These balances resulted in a net liability of $2.6 billion. The pension benefit obligation is the estimated  present  value  of  future  pension  benefits  attributed  to  employee  services  rendered  to  date, including assumptions about future compensation levels.

(a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

      "question": "How does the 12.9% operating profit margin reported by Raytheon Missiles & Defense in 2021 compare to Emerson's (EMR) approach to measuring and managing operating profit margin as described in its 2022 financial report?",
      "answer": "Raytheon Missiles & Defense reported a 12.9% operating profit margin in 2021, reflecting strong segment-level profitability. In contrast, Emerson (EMR) emphasized a broader operational strategy focused on improving underlying profitability by excluding non-recurring and external factors such as acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange fluctuations when measuring operating profit margin. EMR defines operating profit margin as operating profit divided by net sales, and uses it to evaluate ongoing profitability and short-term operational performance across its businesses. This suggests that while RTX's Raytheon Missiles & Defense achieved a specific high-margin result in 2021, EMR applies a more dynamic and adjusted framework to assess and manage its operating profit margin over time.",

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. In connection with the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - 'Risk Factors,' which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement the Company's financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain 'non-GAAP financial measures,' as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management's control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the Company's financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nUnderlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure: net sales ).\n\nOperating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings",

      "question": "How does the growth in Caterpillar's total intersegment sales from 2021 to 2023 compare with Lockheed Martin's intersegment sales specifically to Rotary and Mission Systems during the same period, and what might this indicate about the internal revenue dynamics within their respective corporate structures?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's total intersegment sales grew from $4.037 billion in 2021 to $5.109 billion in 2023, an increase of $1.072 billion or 26.5%. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin's intersegment sales to Rotary and Mission Systems increased from $1.895 billion in 2021 to $2.125 billion in 2023, a rise of $230 million or 12.1%. This suggests that Caterpillar experienced a more significant relative increase in internal revenue transfers across its segments compared to Lockheed Martin's sales into the Rotary and Mission Systems segment. The higher growth in intersegment sales at Caterpillar may reflect greater internal integration or shifting internal demand, while Lockheed Martin's lower growth in sales to Rotary and Mission Systems suggests more stable internal dynamics in this segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT \u2192 Intersegment Sales: Caterpillar's intersegment sales increased from $4.037 billion in 2021 to $5.109 billion in 2023, showing a substantial rise in internal revenue transfers.",
        "Hop 2: Intersegment Sales \u2192 Rotary and Mission Systems: Lockheed Martin's intersegment sales to the Rotary and Mission Systems segment rose from $1.895 billion in 2021 to $2.125 billion in 2023, indicating a more moderate growth rate compared to CAT.",
        "Hop 3: Rotary and Mission Systems \u2190 LMT: Lockheed Martin reports the Rotary and Mission Systems segment as one of its core business units, and the intersegment sales data specifically tracks internal revenue flows into this segment over time."

      "question": "How does the magnitude of GE's 2022 Aerospace segment revenues in excess of billings compare to the deferred asset implications in the same segment, and how might this financial dynamic influence LMT's competitive positioning in the Aerospace sector given its reliance on long-term government contracts?",
      "answer": "GE's 2022 Aerospace segment reported revenues in excess of billings of $2,363 million, which contributed to a non-current contract and other deferred asset value of $5,032 million in the same segment. This indicates that GE had significant deferred revenue recognition tied to long-duration contracts. For LMT, which operates in the Aerospace sector under heavily regulated government contracts, this type of deferred asset structure could influence contract negotiation strategies and cash flow timing, particularly when managing long-term service agreements and responding to unilateral contract definitizations by the U.S. Government, both of which can impact profitability and financial flexibility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE \u2192 Rev > Billings: GE disclosed that in 2022, its Aerospace segment had $2,363 million in revenues exceeding billings, indicating deferred revenue recognition.",
        "Hop 2: Rev > Billings \u2192 Aerospace: This revenue imbalance directly relates to the Aerospace segment's contract structure, resulting in a non-current contract and other deferred asset of $5,032 million.",
        "Hop 3: Aerospace \u2190 LMT: LMT operates in the Aerospace sector with a business model heavily dependent on long-term U.S. and foreign government contracts, which are subject to unilateral definitization and deferred payment terms that mirror GE's deferred asset dynamics."

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin had approximately $838 million in third-party guarantees at the end of 2021, with 69% tied to joint venture performance obligations, which could negatively impact profit if obligations are unmet. Caterpillar reported a total profit from reportable segments of $8,673 million in 2021, with Construction Industries contributing $3,706 million and Energy & Transportation contributing $2,768 million. The comparison highlights how Lockheed Martin's exposure to joint venture guarantees introduces contingent liabilities, whereas Caterpillar's diversified segment profitability reflects more direct operational performance without similar contingent risk exposure.",

        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Profit: Lockheed Martin disclosed $838 million in third-party guarantees at year-end 2021, with 69% related to joint venture contractual performance, representing a contingent liability that could negatively impact profit.",

          "chunk_text": "\nApproximately $781 million of standby letters of credit in the 'Less Than 1 Year' category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. (a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

      "question": "What does the comparison between LMT's contingent liabilities and CAT's Resource Industries profitability suggest about their respective risk profiles and capital efficiency, particularly considering CAT's $403 million depreciation expense in 2021?",
      "answer": "LMT faces contingent liabilities of up to $838 million, 69% of which relate to joint venture guarantees, representing a significant off-balance sheet risk tied to third-party performance. In contrast, CAT's Resource Industries segment generated $1.291 billion in profit on $9.963 billion in sales in 2021, with a capital-intensive profile evidenced by $403 million in depreciation expenses. While LMT's risk stems from potential joint venture defaults requiring cash outflows, CAT's risk is tied to asset-intensive operations and capital investment returns. This suggests LMT carries higher contingent liability risk, while CAT faces greater capital efficiency pressures given its significant depreciation costs.",

(a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

The increase was due to higher sales volume driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. End-user demand was higher in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. Dealers decreased inventories more during 2020 than during 2021.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $1.291 billion in 2021, an increase of $395 million, or 44 percent, compared with $896 million in 2020.  The  increase  was  mainly  due  to  higher  sales  volume  and  favorable  price  realization,  partially  offset  by  unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, as well as higher material and period manufacturing costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of cost absorption. Higher period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased during 2021, compared with a decrease during 2020.\n\nHigher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were driven primarily by higher short-term incentive compensation expense and investments aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor costs.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 13.0 percent for 2021, compared with 11.3 percent for 2020.\n\n## Energy &amp; Transportation\n\n",

The updates also eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.\n\n## FISCAL 2023 OUTLOOK\n\nFollowing the announcement of its Climate Technologies divestiture, Emerson will report financial results for Climate Technologies, InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc as discontinued operations for all periods presented, beginning in 2023. The earnings from discontinued operations for 2023 are expected to be $10 billion to $11 billion, or $17 to $19 per share, including the net gains on 2023 divestitures.\n\nEmerson expects order strength and backlog to support fiscal 2023 sales growth. For the full year, consolidated net sales from continuing operations are expected to be up 7 to 9 percent, with underlying sales up 6.5 to 8.5 percent excluding a 3.5 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 4 percent favorable impact from acquisitions net of divestitures.\n\nEarnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be $3.51 to $3.66 (which excludes any potential impact from the 45 percent common equity ownership in Climate Technologies' income or loss post-close), while adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $4.00 to $4.15, excluding a $0.13 per share impact from restructuring actions, a $0.61 per share impact from amortization of intangibles, $0.10 per share from interest income on the Climate Technologies note receivable, and $0.15 per share of interest income on undeployed proceeds from the Climate Technologies and InSinkErator divestitures.\n\nThe Company's fiscal 2023 results from continuing operations after the Climate Technologies divestiture (assumed to close March 31, 2023 for purposes of the guidance above) will include interest income from the $2.25 billion note receivable from Climate Technologies and reflect the 45 percent common equity ownership in the income, or loss, of Climate Technologies. Emerson will not control Climate Technologies post-closing and is therefore unable to estimate the amount of its 45 percent share of Climate Technologies' post-close results. The Company will exclude the interest income from the note receivable from Climate Technologies and its 45 percent share of Climate Technologies' operations in its calculation of fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share. Also excluded from adjusted earnings per share is the interest income on any undeployed net proceeds. The effect of Emerson's 45 percent share of Climate Technologies is expected to be immaterial to post-closing cash flows. The fiscal 2023 outlook assumes approximately $1.2 billion of dividend payments and approximately $2 billion to be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.\n\n## ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nThe information from this Annual Report on Form 10-K set forth in Item 7 under \"Financial Instruments\" is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n## ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nSee the Company's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the report thereon of KPMG LLP (PCAOB ID 185) that follow.",

      "answer": "GE's Principal Pension plan allocated 28% of its assets to global equities in 2021, while FDX's U.S. pension plan allocated 6% to global equities and its international pension plan allocated 18%, resulting in a combined allocation of approximately 8.3% assuming equal weighting. This indicates that GE's Principal Pension had a significantly higher exposure to global equities compared to FDX's pension plans, suggesting a more aggressive stance by GE toward international market risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE \u2192 Principal Pension: GE's 2022 10-K discloses that the Principal Pension plan had 28% of its assets allocated to global equities in 2021.",
        "Hop 2: Principal Pension \u2192 Global Eq: The same filing shows that global equities are a major asset class within the pension plan's allocation strategy, with a target range of 20.0-38.0% and an actual 2021 allocation of 28%.",
        "Hop 3: Global Eq \u2190 FDX: FDX's 2022 10-K reveals that its U.S. pension plan had 6% allocated to global equities and its international plan had 18%, indicating a more conservative overall approach compared to GE's Principal Pension."

      "answer": "The pandemic-induced decline in commercial air travel significantly reduced demand for both engine production and aftermarket services. GE's Commercial Engines segment, which includes spare parts used in shop visits and LEAP engine shipments, faced reduced demand due to fewer flights and aircraft in operation. Pratt & Whitney, as a major engine producer under RTX, also saw its commercial engine business affected, with airline customers deferring or canceling orders. This cascading effect was compounded by lower utilization of existing fleets, which directly impacted the demand for spare parts\u2014highlighted as a key component of GE\u2019s Commercial Engines revenue\u2014and reduced LEAP engine deliveries, as airlines scaled back expansion plans.",

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses. Refer to 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' for further  details.  While  we  have  seen  indications  that  commercial  air  travel  is  recovering,  we  continue  to  closely  monitor  our commercial aerospace assets for recoverability and our off-balance sheet exposures. The following summarizes certain significant assets and off-balance sheet exposures specifically related to our commercial aerospace customers:\n\n",

      "question": "How does CAT's 2022 Total consolidated profit before taxes of $8,204 million reflect its segment profitability adjustments, and how might LMT's fixed-price contract accounting exposure contrast with CAT's methodology differences like the $1,171 million postretirement benefit income?",
      "answer": "CAT's 2022 Total consolidated profit before taxes of $8,204 million was influenced by its segment profitability, which totaled $8,673 million from reportable segments, but was reduced by corporate costs ($699 million), restructuring costs ($90 million), and other adjustments such as the $1,171 million postretirement benefit income. These methodology differences show how non-operational factors significantly shape CAT's final pre-tax profit. In contrast, LMT's profitability is shaped by contract accounting policies, especially under fixed-price contracts where profit varies based on actual costs relative to negotiated estimates, exposing them to potential profit erosion or losses if cost overruns occur. This highlights a structural difference in profit volatility drivers: CAT\u2019s is influenced by accounting methodology and corporate-level adjustments, while LMT\u2019s is more directly tied to contract execution performance.",

(a)\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  third-party  guarantees  totaled  $838  million,  of  which  approximately  69%  related  to  guarantees  of contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  non-performance  of  the  joint  venture,  joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\n## Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition\n\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government)  for  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment  of  advanced  technology  systems,  products  and  services.  We  account  for  a  contract  when  it  has  approval  and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance  and  collectability  of  consideration  is  probable.  For  certain  contracts  that  meet  the  foregoing  requirements,  primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

In contrast, Caterpillar's expected Medicare Part D subsidy of $47 total through 2033 reflects a much smaller, long-term liability tied to post-retirement health benefits.

      "question": "How did CAT's 2024 inter-segment sales growth of $120 million influence Pratt & Whitney's segment sales dynamics and RTX's credit risk exposure, given the $491 million allowance for credit losses tied to a 2024 customer bankruptcy?",
      "answer": "CAT reported inter-segment sales of $4,766 million in 2024, reflecting a $120 million increase from 2023. At RTX, inter-segment sales data shows Pratt & Whitney had only $2 million in such sales, indicating its primary revenue came from external sources. However, Pratt & Whitney recorded a significant customer bankruptcy in late 2024, which led to a sharp increase in RTX's allowance for credit losses to $491 million by year-end. This suggests that while inter-segment sales at CAT grew modestly, the credit risk exposure at RTX, particularly through Pratt & Whitney, was amplified by external customer defaults, highlighting a contrast in internal versus external financial risk profiles across these firms.",

        "Hop 1: CAT \u2192 Inter-Segment Sales: CAT's 2024 inter-segment sales increased by $120 million to $4,766 million, showing a growing role of internal transactions within CAT.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Pratt & Whitney's allowance for expected credit losses in 2024 impact RTX's consolidated operating profit, and how does this compare to Honeywell's treatment of similar financial risks as reflected in their 'Other Segment Items'?",
      "answer": "The increase in Pratt & Whitney's allowance for expected credit losses in 2024, which rose by $294 million (from $197 million in 2023 to $491 million in 2024), contributed to RTX's overall financial risk exposure. This increase was recorded in the fourth quarter and directly affected RTX's consolidated financial statements. Pratt & Whitney\u2019s 2023 'Other Segment Items' were $18,750 million, which included such credit loss provisions and contributed to a negative operating profit margin of (8.0%) for that segment. In contrast, Honeywell's 2024 financials show that 'Other Segment Items' were allocated across its business units at $1,044 million for Aerospace Technologies, $817 million for Industrial Automation, $423 million for Building Automation, and $384 million for Energy and Sustainability Solutions. These items suggest that Honeywell also accounts for credit and financial risk exposure, though more moderately in proportion to segment profits compared to RTX\u2019s Pratt & Whitney segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: RTX \u2192 Pratt & Whitney: RTX recorded a significant increase in allowance for expected credit losses in 2024, primarily due to a customer bankruptcy at Pratt & Whitney, rising from $197 million in 2023 to $491 million in 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Pratt & Whitney \u2192 Other Segment Items: Pratt & Whitney\u2019s 2023 'Other Segment Items' were $18,750 million, which included credit loss reserves and contributed to a negative operating profit margin of (8.0%) for the segment.",
        "Hop 3: Other Segment Items \u2190 HON: Honeywell's 2024 financials show that 'Other Segment Items' were distributed across its business units, with $1,044 million in Aerospace Technologies, $817 million in Industrial Automation, $423 million in Building Automation, and $384 million in Energy and Sustainability Solutions, indicating a different approach to financial risk provisioning."

      "answer": "A 25 basis point increase in RTX's EROA would increase RTX's Net Periodic Benefit Income by approximately $133 million, as disclosed in RTX's 2023 10-K. Since Boeing's Net Periodic Benefit Income in 2023 was ($527) million, this change would partially offset Boeing's pension expense, reducing the net burden on earnings. However, this assumes the sensitivity relationship in RTX directly applies to Boeing, which may not be the case due to differences in plan structure and asset allocation.",

        "Hop 1: BA \u2192 Net Periodic Benefit Income: Boeing reported a Net Periodic Benefit Income of ($527) million in 2023, indicating a net pension expense.",

        "Hop 3: EROA \u2190 RTX: RTX defines EROA as the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan assets and uses it to calculate Net Periodic Benefit Income, which is sensitive to market and assumption changes."

This is consistent with FDX's sensitivity analysis, which shows that a 50 basis point increase in EROA reduces pension expense by $127 million, indicating a similar directional relationship between EROA and benefit income/expense.",

        "Hop 2: Net Periodic Benefit Income \u2192 EROA: The sensitivity of net periodic benefit income to EROA is linear, meaning a 50 basis point change would have approximately double the impact of a 25 basis point change.",
        "Hop 3: EROA \u2190 FDX: FDX discloses that a 50 basis point increase in EROA would decrease pension expense by $127 million, confirming the inverse relationship between EROA and pension expense, which aligns with RTX's sensitivity of net periodic benefit income to EROA."

      "answer": "Honeywell (HON) relies on asset utilization as a key assumption in estimating contract costs for long-term contracts, which directly influences its revenue recognition. Union Pacific (UNP) reported a 5% improvement in locomotive productivity in 2024, attributing this gain to better network fluidity and asset utilization. This suggests that while HON depends on projected asset utilization for financial reporting, UNP demonstrated measurable improvements in the same metric, reflecting actual operational performance rather than forward-looking estimates. The contrast highlights how asset utilization serves as both a forecasting input for revenue in HON\u2019s business model and a realized efficiency outcome in UNP\u2019s operations.",

A lso, projections of any evaluation of effectiv eness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers - Long-Term Contracts - Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company has several businesses which enter into long-term contracts whereby revenue is recognized over the contract term ('over time') as the work progresses and control of the goods and services are continuously transferred to the customer. Revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion, generally measured by using a cost-to-cost input method.\n\nAccounting for long-term contracts requires management's judgment in estimating total contract costs. Contract costs, which can be incurred over several years, are largely determined based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms and consider factors such as historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements.\n\nGiven the significance of the judgments necessary to estimate costs associated with these long-term contracts (which varies upon the length of the contract), auditing long-term contracts requires a high degree of auditor judgment.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to long-term contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the recognition of revenue and the determination of estimated contract costs including controls over the review of management's assumptions and key inputs used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method.\n- We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method to recognize revenue over time.\n- We tested recorded revenue using a combination of analytical procedures and detailed contract testing.\n\n## /S/ DE LOITTE  &amp; TOUCHE LLP\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nFebruary 14, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.\n\n115 Honeywell International Inc.",

          "chunk_text": "## Fellow Shareholders:\n\nThe Union Pacific team had a v ery successful 2024, as we executed our strategy of Safety, Serv ice, and Operational Excellence leading to Growth. The commitment to that strategy enabled the team to achiev e strong results across the board and set the Company up for future success. Although success can be measured in many ways, it's ultimately about deliv ering for our owners, putting our company in a great financial position, and being clear about what success is for our employees, our customers, and the communities where we operate.\n\nIn 2024, we reported earnings per diluted share of $11.09, a 6% increase v ersus 2023. T otal v olumes increased 3% v ersus 2023, driv en by strength in international intermodal and agricultural products, more than offsetting a 20% decline in coal and the ov erall impact of a muted industrial economy. We achiev ed an operating ratio of 59.9%, a 240-basis point improv ement v ersus 2023, driv en by the day-to-day actions of our team to improv e the efficiency of our network.\n\nThis success doesn't just happen. It's rooted in that commitment to our strategy. Within Safety , we achiev ed significant reductions in both our personal injury and derailment rates. We are seeing the results from our inv estments in training, safety programs, infrastructure, and technology. We cannot and will not waiv er on our goal to be the best in safety.\n\nService is what we sold our customers. Committing to what we can do and doing it with excellence. We built on our success in late 2023 to prov ide our customers with an even stronger serv ice product throughout 2024.  Our full  year  operating  metrics  demonstrate  that  success,  as  freight  car  v elocity improved 2% and intermodal and manifest serv ice performance index (SPI) improv ed 2 and 4 points, respectiv ely. We also inv ested $3.4 billion in capital to harden our infrastructure, grow our business, prov ide better serv ice, and embed new technologies into our processes. T he list is long, but we will reap long-term rewards from inv estments in the Phoenix Intermodal Terminal, hump yard improv ements, siding extensions, application programming interfaces (API), and new gate technologies, to name only a few.\n\nOperational Excellence is about operating efficiently and productiv ely, deliv ering v alue with speed. Yet understanding we need a resource buffer so we can provide the serv ice we promised and handle the inev itable ups and downs that come with weather, fluctuating v olumes, and securing growth. As evident by the improv ements to our operating ratio, we made great strides in 2024 to use our assets more efficiently. Howev er, that wasn't done without challenges that tested our resource buffer. During 2024, we saw international intermodal surge on the west coast, growing ov er 19% v ersus 2023. Our ability to handle that v olume with minimal impact on the rest of our network demonstrates the effectiv eness of our buffer strategy. More specifically on resource productiv ity, in 2024, we achiev ed 6% and 5% improv ements in workforce and locomotiv e productiv ity, respectiv ely. In fact, our performance in workforce productiv ity for the year was a best ev er result.\n\nOur ability to excel in those three areas led to Growth in  2024. Operating Rev enues grew 1% driv en by v olume gains and strong core pricing, which more than offset lower fuel surcharge rev enues and an unfav orable business mix. When you remov e the impact of fuel, our freight rev enues grew 4%. Key is  that  in  a  muted  economic  env ironment,  and  with  a  significant  decline  in  our  coal  v olume,  we  still  grew .  By  executing  on  our  strategy,  we  are outperforming our markets and positioning ourselv es to be ready for ev en stronger growth when the freight economy improv es.\n\nAs we turn the page to 2025, the team is focused on what's possible and unlocking the v alue of the Union Pacific franchise. We are ready to build on these accomplishments to achiev e a higher lev el of success. We understand that we're the current stewards of this amazing, historic company. And it's our responsibility to leav e it in a better place than we found it, as those before us had done. We are grateful for that opportunity and ready to succeed. Thank you for your ownership of Union Pacific.\n\nChief Executiv e Officer",

GD's Defense Segments categorize their backlog into funded and unfunded portions, where the funded portion includes contracts already appropriated by Congress or foreign governments, and the unfunded portion includes amounts expected to be funded in the future. GD also includes unexercised options and unfunded work on IDIQ contracts in their estimated potential contract value. This distinction affects revenue visibility: BA\u2019s backlog provides clearer near-term revenue visibility due to its firm order nature, while GD\u2019s Defense Segments rely more on future appropriations and option exercises, introducing greater uncertainty in long-term revenue forecasting.",

The 2021 loss includes a reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million, abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX of $1,887 million, and abnormal production costs related to the 787 program of $468 million resulting from continued production issues, inspections and rework, partially offset by higher 737 MAX deliveries. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million and additional drivers as noted in the paragraph below.\n\nBCA loss from operations was $13,847 million in 2020 compared with $6,657 million in 2019. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,  $2,567  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  related  to  737  MAX,  $623  million  of  severance  cost,  $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  in  the  first  half  of  2020  from  the  temporary  suspension  of  operations  in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction  in  the  accounting  quantity  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  also  contributed  to  lower  earnings.  The  2019  loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nLower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.\n\n## Backlog\n\nOur  total  backlog  represents  the  estimated  transaction  prices  on  unsatisfied  and  partially  satisfied  performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform.

The  estimated  costs  at  completion  for  each  contract  are  used  to  assess  the  proportion  of revenues to recognize based upon the costs incurred-to-date in comparison to the total estimate of costs to complete the contract.\n\nWe identified the assessment of the estimation of costs at completion for a select group of long-term contracts in the defense segments as a critical audit matter. The estimated costs at completion for the select  group  of  long-term  contracts  incorporates  assumptions,  such  as  labor  hours  and  the  cost  of materials for the work to be performed. The evaluation of one or more of the assumptions used in the estimation of the costs to complete for the select group of contracts required a high level of subjective auditor judgment due to the nature of the individual contracts and related contract performance risks. Specifically,  changes  to  certain  assumptions  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  estimated  revenue recorded during the period.\n\nThe following are primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the estimation of costs at completion for the select group of long-term contracts. This included contract level controls over the estimated cost assumptions. For certain contracts, we compared the Company's historical estimates of  costs  to  actual  costs  incurred  to  assess  the  Company's  ability  to  estimate  accurately.  Based  on  the nature  of  the  individual  contract,  we  evaluated  certain  assumptions  within  the  Company's  estimated costs at completion by:\n\n- -reading the underlying contract and any related amendments to obtain an understanding of the contractual requirements and related performance obligations\n- -assessing  costs  incurred  to-date  and  the  relative  progress  toward  satisfying  the  performance obligation(s) of the contract\n- -assessing, if relevant, the estimated costs at completion on similar or predecessor contracts and programs\n- -inquiring of financial and operational personnel of the Company to identify factors that should be considered within the estimated costs at completion or indications of potential management bias\n- -inspecting correspondence, if any, between the Company and the customer regarding actual todate and expected performance\n- -analyzing the sufficiency of the Company's assessment of contract performance risks included within the estimated costs at completion.\n\n## Discount rates used in pension benefit obligation\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  S  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements, t he  Company's  pension  benefit obligation and the associated plan assets were $17.8 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, on December 31, 2021.

Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\n\nWe  derive  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  from  a  limited  number  of  commercial  airlines. We  can  make  no assurance  that  any  customer  will  exercise  purchase  options,  fulfill  existing  purchase  commitments  or  purchase additional  products  or  services  from  us.  In  addition,  fleet  decisions,  airline  consolidations  or  financial  challenges involving  any  of  our  major  commercial  airline  customers  could  significantly  reduce  our  revenues  and  limit  our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n\nOur Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specification, achieve planned production rate  targets,  successfully  develop  new  aircraft  or  new  derivative  aircraft,  and  meet  or  exceed  stringent performance and reliability standards.\n\nThe commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S.  suppliers,  highly-skilled  labor  from  thousands  of  employees  and  other  partners,  and  stringent  regulatory requirements,  including  the  risk  of  evolving  standards  for  commercial  aircraft  certification,  and  performance  and reliability standards. The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the implementation of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, among them changing the process for certification of commercial aircraft. Comparable agencies that regulate similar matters in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or other similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. The 737 program experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of commercial operations of the 737 MAX aircraft by civil aviation  authorities around the globe. 737 MAX deliveries resumed in late 2020 and early 2021 upon approval of the FAA and other nonU.S. civil aviation authorities. During 2020 and 2021, we experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries, including a pause in 787 deliveries since May 2021. During 2021, this  resulted  in  reprioritizing  production  resources  to  support  inspections  and  rework.  We  continue  to  conduct inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries as well as rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the  contractual  delivery  date.  The  regulators  will  ultimately  determine  the  timing  and  conditions  for  resuming  787 deliveries. Delays on the 737 MAX, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\n\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to  adjust  production  rates  on  several  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs.  During  2021,  we  reprioritized  production resources to support inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft. The 787 program is currently producing at very low rates and expects that to continue until deliveries resume. We are also continuing to implement changes in the production  process  designed  to  ensure  that  newly-built  airplanes  meet  our  specifications  and  do  not  require  further inspections  and  rework.

      "answer": "Emerson reported 4% underlying volume growth in 2023, which signals increased industrial activity. This trend likely contributed to FedEx Ground\u2019s 2% revenue growth in 2024, as higher production volumes typically correlate with increased shipping demand. FedEx Ground specifically cited higher volume as a driver of its revenue increase. UPS, which also depends on volume-driven logistics demand, references its integration of ground freight services through both company-owned and third-party carrier networks. Therefore, UPS's logistics business could be similarly affected by industrial trends like Emerson's volume growth, mirroring the impact seen in FedEx Ground's performance.",

        "Hop 3: FedEx Ground \u2190 UPS: UPS operates a broad logistics and ground freight network that is also volume-sensitive, suggesting similar exposure to industrial demand trends as seen in FedEx Ground\u2019s performance."

      "answer": "UPS includes prepaid pension assets as part of its unallocated assets, which are not assigned to specific business segments and consist primarily of cash, deferred taxes, and centrally held property, plant, and equipment. In contrast, LMT explicitly separates prepaid pension assets and classifies them under other noncurrent assets on its consolidated balance sheets, with a detailed disclosure of accumulated benefit obligations (e.g., $43.4 billion as of December 31, 2021). This reveals that while UPS integrates long-term pension assets into broader unallocated reserves, LMT takes a more segmented and transparent approach, reflecting distinct philosophies in managing and reporting long-term obligations.",

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\n\nWe have two reportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. Global small package operations represent our most significant business and are broken down into regional operations around the world. Regional operations managers are responsible for both domestic and export products within their geographic area. Supply Chain Solutions comprises the results of non-reportable operating segments that do not meet the quantitative and qualitative criteria of a reportable segment as defined under ASC Topic 280 - Segment Reporting.\n\n## U.S. Domestic Package\n\nU.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents and packages throughout the United States.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide, including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or destination outside the United States. Our International Package reporting segment includes our operations in Europe, Asia, Americas and ISMEA.\n\n## Supply Chain Solutions\n\nSupply Chain Solutions includes our Forwarding, Logistics, Coyote, Marken, UPS Mail Innovations and other businesses. Our Forwarding, Logistics and UPS Mail Innovations units provide services in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide and include international air and ocean freight forwarding, customs brokerage, distribution and post-sales services, mail and consulting services. Coyote offers truckload brokerage services primarily in the United States. Marken is a global provider of supply chain solutions to the healthcare and life sciences industry, specializing in clinical trials logistics. Other businesses within this segment include The UPS Store, UPS Capital and Roadie. This segment also included UPS Freight prior to its divestiture, details of which are set out in note 4.\n\nIn evaluating financial performance, we focus on operating profit as a segment's measure of profit or loss. Operating profit is before investment income (expense) and other, interest expense and income tax expense. Certain expenses are allocated between the segments using activity-based costing methods as described in Part I, \"Item 7. Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. As we operate an integrated, global multimodal network, we evaluate many of our capital expenditure decisions at a network level. Accordingly, expenditures on property, plant and equipment by segment are not presented. Unallocated assets are comprised primarily of cash and marketable securities.",

      "question": "How does the 2023 operating profit decline in UPS's U.S. Domestic Package segment compare to Emerson's (EMR) approach to managing operating profit volatility, given the scale of UPS's segment contribution to consolidated profitability?",
      "answer": "UPS's U.S. Domestic Package segment reported an operating profit of $5,076 million in 2023, down from $6,997 million in 2022, representing a significant year-over-year decline of $1,921 million. This drop contrasts with Emerson\u2019s (EMR) strategic emphasis on managing operating profit volatility through non-GAAP financial measures like adjusted EBITA and EBITDA, which strip out non-operational items such as restructuring costs and acquisition-related expenses to highlight underlying performance. Given that UPS's U.S. Domestic Package segment contributes over half of its consolidated revenue ($59,958 million out of $90,958 million in 2023), the segment\u2019s profit volatility has a pronounced effect on overall company performance, underscoring the importance of EMR's approach to isolating and managing core operating profit drivers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS \u2192 U.S. Domestic Package: UPS's U.S. Domestic Package segment had a significant drop in operating profit from $6,997 million in 2022 to $5,076 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: U.S. Domestic Package \u2192 Operating Profit: The U.S. Domestic Package segment contributed $59,958 million in revenue in 2023, making it the largest revenue contributor to UPS and thus a critical driver of consolidated profitability.",
        "Hop 3: Operating Profit \u2190 EMR: Emerson (EMR) actively manages operating profit volatility using non-GAAP metrics like adjusted EBITA and EBITDA, which exclude restructuring costs, acquisition impacts, and other non-operational items to assess underlying performance."

      "question": "How does Boeing's 2024 profit volatility from long-term contract adjustments compare to the performance trends in CAT's Financial Products Segment, especially considering their distinct exposure to risk factors?",
      "answer": "Boeing's 2024 financial performance was significantly impacted by cumulative catch-up adjustments totaling $6,562 million due to changes in revenue and cost estimates on long-term contracts, particularly on fixed-price development programs like KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. These adjustments reflect substantial risk exposure from estimation uncertainties in long-term contract accounting. In contrast, CAT's Financial Products Segment reported a 34% decline in operating profit, from $923 million in 2023 to $605 million in 2024, indicating a much smaller but still notable volatility. While Boeing's exposure stems from complex, government-focused contract execution risks, CAT's decline suggests a different risk profile, likely tied to financial services market conditions. Both companies demonstrate sensitivity to estimation and forecasting risks, but through different business lenses and with significantly different absolute impacts.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\n## Accounting for Long-term Contracts\n\nSubstantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or serv ices and the significant serv ice of integration that we prov ide.\n\nAccounting for long-term contracts inv olv es a judgmental process of estimating the total rev enue, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and rev enue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.\n\nDue to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total rev enues and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many v ariables. T otal rev enue estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract  options,  change  orders,  incentiv e  and  award  fee  prov isions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  as inflation  or  index-based  clauses).  T he  majority  of  these  long-term  contracts  are  with  the  U.S.  gov ernment  where  the  price  is  generally  based  on  the estimated  cost  to  produce  the  product  or  serv ice  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  prov ide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be reimbursed  in  establishing  contract  price.  T otal  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and supplier performance trends, production quality, labor instability, supply chain delays and quality issues, business v olume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.\n\nRevenue and cost estimates for all significant  long-term  contract  performance  obligations  are  rev iewed  and  reassessed  quarterly.  Changes  in  these estimates could result in recognition of cumulativ e catch-up adjustments to the contract's inception to date rev enues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in rev enue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reachforward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. Net cumulativ e catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated rev enues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts, including the impact of estimated losses on unexercised options, increased Loss from operations by $6,562 million, $2,943 million and $5,253 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely, and were primarily due to losses recognized on the KC-46A T anker, T -7A Red Hawk, Commercial Crew, VC-25B, and MQ-25 programs. These are all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.\n\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described abov e, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different  assumptions  or  if  the  underlying  circumstances  were  to  change.  For  example,  changes  in  underlying  operational  assumptions,  inability  to implement  planned  risk  mitigation  plans,  failure  to  achiev e  productiv ity  targets,  supplier  shortages,  quality  issues  and/or  pricing  issues,  inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adv ersely affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts  had  been  estimated  to  be  higher  or  lower  by  1%  during  2024,  it  would  hav e  increased  or  decreased  pre-tax  income  for  the  year  by approximately $290 million.\n\n## Program Accounting\n\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate rev enues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number",

      "question": "How did the implementation of fuel surcharges impact revenue per piece growth and operating margin performance in the U.S. Domestic Package segments of both FedEx and UPS in 2022, and what does this reveal about their respective pricing and cost management strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx cited yield improvement at FedEx Ground driven by higher fuel surcharges, contributing to a 9% revenue increase in that segment. Similarly, UPS reported double-digit revenue per piece growth in its U.S. Domestic Package segment, attributing this to fuel and demand-related surcharges alongside base rate increases. UPS also noted that expenses rose due to higher fuel prices and employee compensation costs, though these were offset slightly by productivity improvements. FedEx similarly indicated that fuel surcharges were a significant component of pricing strategy, influencing both revenue and yield. The parallel use of fuel surcharges by both companies reveals a shared strategy to pass on rising fuel costs to customers, while UPS\u2019s explicit mention of productivity improvements suggests a more aggressive focus on cost containment, which may have supported stronger margin performance despite similar cost pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: FDX \u2192 Fuel Surcharges: FDX reported that yield improvement at FedEx Ground, driven by higher fuel surcharges, contributed to a 9% revenue increase in that segment in 2022.",

        "Hop 3: U.S. Domestic Package Segment \u2190 UPS: UPS also indicated that operating expenses increased due to higher fuel prices and employee compensation costs, though productivity improvements helped offset some of these increases, suggesting a dual focus on pricing power and cost control."

          "chunk_text": "## Revenue\n\nRevenue increased 11% in 2022 primarily due to yield management actions, including higher fuel surcharges, as well as commercial and home delivery volume growth at FedEx Ground and volume growth at FedEx Freight. In addition, we experienced severe winter weather in the prior year which positively affected the year-over-year comparisons in 2022.\n\nRevenue at FedEx Express increased 9% in 2022 due to global package and international priority freight yield improvement, partially offset by decreased international and U.S. domestic package volume, as well as lower U.S. average daily freight pounds. At FedEx Ground, revenue increased 9% in 2022 primarily due to yield improvement, two additional ground commercial operating days, a mix shift to higher-yielding services, and growth in our commercial services. FedEx Freight revenue increased 22% in 2022 primarily due to higher revenue per shipment and increased average daily shipments. Revenue at Corporate, other, and eliminations increased 33% in 2022 primarily due to higher yields at FedEx Logistics, Inc. ('FedEx Logistics') as a result of market capacity constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWhile fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. See the 'Fuel' section of this MD&amp;A for more information.\n\n## Business Realignment Costs\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan will affect approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a works council consultation process that will occur through 2023 in accordance with local country processes and regulations.\n\nWe incurred costs of $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 and $116 million ($90 million, net of tax, or $0.33 per diluted share) in 2021 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $225 million in 2022 and approximately $15 million in 2021. We expect the pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities to be approximately $420 million through 2023. We expect savings from our business realignment activities to be between $275 million and $350 million on an annualized basis beginning in 2024. The actual amount and timing of business realignment costs and related cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectations and estimates.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nThe following table compares operating expenses expressed as dollar amounts (in millions) and as a percent of revenue for the years ended May 31:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\n- Revenue increased in all segments, with double digit revenue per piece growth in both U.S. Domestic Package and International Package.\n- Average daily package volume increases were driven by growth in SMB and business-to-business volume.\n- Operating expenses increased, primarily driven by fuel and third-party transportation costs.\n- Operating profit and operating margin increased in global small package and Supply Chain Solutions.\n- We reported net income of $12.9 billion and diluted earnings per share of $14.68. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 22, 2021.",

We develop a culture of health and safety by:\n\n- investing in safety training and audits;\n- promoting wellness practices which mitigate risk; and\n- offering benefits designed to keep employees safe in the workplace and beyond.\n\nOur local health and safety committees coach employees on UPS's safety processes and are able to share best practices across work groups. Our safety methods and procedures are increasingly focused on the variables associated with residential delivery environments, which have become more common with the growth in e-commerce. We monitor our performance in this area through various measurable targets including lost time injury frequency and the number of recorded auto accidents.\n\n## Customers\n\nBuilding and maintaining long-term customer relationships is a competitive strength of UPS. In 2021, we served 1.7 million shipping customers and more than 11.8 million delivery customers daily. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, represented approximately 11.7% of our consolidated revenues, substantially all of which was within our U.S. Domestic Package segment. For additional information on our customers, see 'Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - Changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us' and note 15 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe offer a broad array of transportation and logistics services and compete with many local, regional, national and international logistics providers as well as national postal services. We believe our strategy, network and competitive strengths position us well to compete in the marketplace. For additional information on our competitive environment, see \"Risk Factors Business and Operating Risks - Our industry is rapidly evolving. We expect to continue to face significant competition, which could materially adversely affect us\".\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Continued compliance with increasingly stringent laws, regulations and policies in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate may result in materially increased costs, or we could be subject to substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations.\n\n## Air Operations\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation ('DOT'), the Federal Aviation Administration ('FAA') and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration ('TSA'), have primary regulatory authority over our air transportation services.\n\nThe DOT's authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as operating authority, insurance requirements, pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates international routes, fares, rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments or, in the absence of such agreements, by principles of reciprocity. We are also subject to current and potential aviation, health, customs and immigration regulations imposed by governments in other countries in which we operate, including registration and license requirements and security regulations. We have international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is subject to DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions.\n\nThe FAA's authority primarily relates to operational, technical and safety aspects of air transportation, including certification, aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. customs regulation.",

      "answer": "LMT's Aeronautics segment experienced a $1.2 billion increase in product costs in 2024 due to production ramp-up and losses on a classified contract, which contributed to a $235 million increase in service costs driven by higher volume. This indicates that rising product costs at LMT are indirectly influencing service cost trends through increased operational activity. At RTX, service costs are being negatively impacted by significant customer support and maintenance expenses tied to the inspection and repair of PW1100 GTF engines, with these costs expected to persist through 2026.

The increase was primarily attributable to higher product costs of $2.5 billion at MFC, $1.2 billion at Aeronautics and $1.1 billion at RMS. Higher product costs at MFC were due to $1.4 billion in reach-forward losses on a classified program and production ramp up as described above in 'Product Sales'. Higher product costs at Aeronautics were due to higher volume and production ramp up as described above in 'Product Sales' and $555 million of losses recognized on a classified contract.

In addition, we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium, nickel, and titanium, and we rely on foreign suppliers as single-source suppliers of some components. Some raw materials and components have been in the past sourced from areas now under sanctions, such as Russia, or are currently sourced from areas which are at risk of sanctions or other trade restrictive actions, such as China.\n\nThe timing of the impacts of these supply chain risks and issues and our ability to mitigate them are uncertain and difficult to predict. However, we expect the current supply chain, inflation, and price issues, and their negative impacts on our business, to continue. In particular, we expect to experience prolonged delays for certain critical component parts and sub-systems. Furthermore, the existing supply chain issues could be compounded by other events, such as an economic downturn; changes in trade policies, such as tariffs; supplier capacity constraints for other reasons; supplier quality issues (for ex ample, defects or fraudulent parts); supplier closing, bankruptcy, or financial difficulties; price increases for various reasons; and worsening shortages of raw materials or commodities, including as a result of war or other geopolitical actions, natural disaster (including the effects of climate change), health pandemic or other business continuity events, or transport and distribution issues, any of which could further negatively impact our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs and therefore incrementally affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nDue to the nature of our products and services, a product safety failure, quality issue, or other failure affecting our or our customers' or suppliers' products or systems could seriously harm our business. Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, involve complex advanced technologies, are often integrated with third-party products and services, and are utilized for specific purposes that require precision, reliability, and durability. Many of our products and services include both hardware and software that involve industrial machinery and intricate aviation and defense systems, including commercial and military jet engines, power and control systems, and other aircraft parts, air and missile defense systems, and military sensors and command and control systems. Technical, mechanical,  quality,  electronic,  and  other  failures  may  occur  from  time  to  time,  whether  as  a  result  of  manufacturing  or  design  defect,  operational  process,  or production issue attributable to us, our customers, suppliers, partners, third party integrators, or others.  Product design changes and updates could also have associated cost and schedule impacts. In addition, our products could fail as a result of cyber-attacks, such as those that seize control and result in misuse or unintended use of our products, or other intentional acts. The impact of a catastrophic product or system failure or similar event affecting our or our customers' or suppliers' products or services could be significant, and could result in injuries or death, property damage, loss of strategic capabilities, loss of intellectual property, loss  of  reputation,  and  other  significant  negative  effects.  A  product  or  system  failure,  or  perceived  failure,  could  lead  to  negative  publicity,  a  diversion  of management attention, and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. It could also result in product recalls and product liability and warranty claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) and related ex penses, other service, repair, and maintenance costs, labor  and  material  costs,  customer  support  costs,  significant  damages,  and  other  costs,  including  fines  and  other  remedies,  and  regulatory  and  environmental liabilities. We may also incur increased costs, delayed payments, reputational harm, or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party's product with which our products are integrated. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\n\nIn particular, in 2023, Pratt &amp; Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the  PW1100  GTF fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft.  This determination and corresponding fleet actions have resulted in, and are expected to continue  to  result  in,  an  elevated  level  of  aircraft  on  ground  for  the A320neo  family  of  aircraft  and  significant  incremental  shop  visits  necessary  to  perform inspections on PW1100 GTF engines through the end of 2026. As a result, we have and will continue to incur significant customer support and mitigation costs and significant labor, material, and related costs.  This matter has caused reputational harm and has negatively impacted, and will continue to impact, our results of operations and financial condition. The expected financial impact of the powder metal issue is based on historical experience and is subject to various assumptions and judgments, including, without limitation, the number and expected timing of shop visits, inspection results and scope of work to be performed, turnaround time, availability of parts, available capacity at overhaul facilities, and outcomes of negotiations with impacted customers, and these assumptions are subject to variability. Potential changes to these assumptions could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations for the periods in which it is recognized. In addition, other engine models within Pratt &amp; Whitney's fleet contain parts manufactured with affected powder metal. The negative impacts arising from the Powder Metal Matter could increase if any other engine models are found to be materially impacted by this rare condition.\n\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract, train, and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business.

      "answer": "EMR's U.S. exports grew by 33% in 2022, reaching $1.5 billion, partly driven by the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. This reflects a broader trend of increasing U.S. export activity, which is particularly relevant to the aerospace segment, where U.S. exports represent 23% of segment sales (as per Honeywell's 2022 data). For RTX, which operates in the aerospace sector through entities like Pratt & Whitney Canada, this export growth could amplify foreign exchange exposure, as a significant portion of costs are in local currencies (e.g., Canadian Dollar), while sales are often in U.S. Dollars. RTX manages this by hedging up to 49 months of U.S. Dollar sales exposure at firms like Collins Aerospace and P&W Canada. The combination of rising U.S. exports and the aerospace segment's structural currency mismatch suggests RTX may need to expand or refine its hedging strategies to mitigate increased FX volatility associated with higher export volumes.",

Underlying sales increased 5 percent in Europe, 5 percent in Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa (China up 15 percent), 9 percent in Latin America and 1 percent in Canada. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $9.3 billion in 2021, up 9 percent compared with 2020.\n\n## ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\nPortfolio management is an integral component of Emerson's growth and value creation strategy. Over the past 18 months, Emerson has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and divestitures of non-core businesses. These actions were undertaken to create a higher growth and cohesive industrial technology portfolio as a global automation leader serving a diversified set of end markets with differentiated capabilities in intelligent devices and software. The Company's recent portfolio actions include the following transactions.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in fiscal 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone (\"Blackstone\") in a transaction valued at $14.0 billion. Emerson will receive upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.5 billion and a note of $2.25 billion at close (which will accrue 5 percent interest payable in kind by capitalizing interest), while retaining a 45 percent noncontrolling common equity ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The Climate Technologies business, which includes the Copeland compressor business and the entire portfolio of products and services across all residential and commercial HVAC and refrigeration end-markets, had fiscal 2022 net sales of approximately $5.0 billion and pretax earnings of $1.0 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The Company expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $10 billion (approximately $8 billion after-tax) in fiscal 2023 upon the completion of the transaction.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion. This business had net sales of $630 and pretax earnings of $152 in fiscal 2022 and is reported in the Tools &amp; Home Products segment. The assets and liabilities of InSinkErator were classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2022 and are included in other current assets, other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $2.8 billion (approximately $2.1 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nOn May 16, 2022, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"Heritage AspenTech\") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectively, the 'Emerson Industrial Software Business'), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (hereinafter referred to as \"AspenTech\"). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson beneficially owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis) and former Heritage AspenTech stockholders owned the remaining outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock. AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's previous name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under Heritage AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.' On a pro forma basis, AspenTech had fiscal 2022 net sales of $1.1 billion.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWithin our aerospace business, our sales are typically denominated in U.S. Dollars. However, for our non-U.S. based entities, such as Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (P&amp;WC), a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies. Consequently, there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as U.S. Dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the Canadian Dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations. Additionally, we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against these other currencies, we hedge a certain portion of sales to secure  the  rates  at  which  U.S.  Dollars  will  be  converted.  The  majority  of  this  hedging  activity  occurs  at  P&amp;WC  and  Collins Aerospace,  and  hedging  activity  also  occurs  to  a  lesser  extent  at  the  remainder  of  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney.  At  P&amp;WC  and  Collins Aerospace,  firm  and  forecasted  sales  for  both  original  equipment  and  spare  parts  are  hedged  at  varying  amounts  for  up  to  49 months  on  the  U.S.  Dollar  sales  exposure  as  represented  by  the  excess  of  U.S.  Dollar  sales  over  U.S.  Dollar  denominated purchases.  Hedging  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  movements  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  are  partially  offset  by  the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. While the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results, there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts, changes in the sales profile, volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk. We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations. A 100 basis points unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate $4 billion impact on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we believe our exposure to interest rate risk on our fixed-rate debt is not material. From time to time, we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures, but may consider such strategies in the future.",

RTX disclosed that a 25 basis point change in EROA would affect their net periodic benefit income by $133 million. Comparatively, BA reported a net periodic benefit income of $527 million in 2023, which already incorporates their current EROA assumptions. This suggests that both FDX and BA have significant exposure to changes in asset return assumptions, though the specific sensitivity is only explicitly quantified for FDX and RTX.",

      "question": "How does the operating profit margin of Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics segment in 2023 compare to Caterpillar's overall operating profit pressure from global competitive discounting, given Caterpillar's exposure to margin compression risks?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics segment reported an operating profit of $2,825 million on net sales of $27,474 million in 2023, resulting in a profit margin of approximately 10.3%. In contrast, Caterpillar noted that price discounting in competitive markets was putting pressure on margins, which can negatively impact its overall operating profit. This indicates that while Lockheed's Aeronautics segment maintained a healthy margin in 2023, Caterpillar faced external pressures that could lead to margin compression across its operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Aeronautics: Lockheed Martin operates in four business segments, one of which is Aeronautics, which generated $27,474 million in net sales in 2023.",

      "question": "How did GE's restructuring affect GE Aerospace's postretirement benefit obligations, and how does this liability exposure compare to Boeing's postretirement benefit obligations?",
      "answer": "GE's restructuring in 2023 led to the allocation of approximately $4.2 billion in net postretirement benefit plan liabilities, including portions of principal pension plans, other pension plans, and principal retiree benefit plans, to GE HealthCare and GE Vernova, which directly reduced the liabilities retained by GE Aerospace. This means that GE Aerospace retained a smaller share of legacy postretirement obligations compared to before the separation. In contrast, Boeing continues to disclose significant exposure to postretirement benefit plans as part of its ongoing financial obligations, with liabilities reflected on its Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Boeing's postretirement plans include health care coverage for eligible retirees and dependents, and the net periodic cost is determined using actuarial assumptions such as discount rates and medical trend rates. Therefore, while GE Aerospace has reduced its exposure through corporate restructuring, Boeing maintains a larger, ongoing liability tied to these benefits.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BA \u2192 Postretirement Benefit Plans: Boeing discloses ongoing financial obligations related to postretirement benefit plans, including health care for retirees, with liabilities reflected on its Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.",
        "Hop 2: Postretirement Benefit Plans \u2192 GE Aerospace: In 2023, GE legally split postretirement liabilities between its spin-offs, with approximately $4.2 billion in liabilities transferred to GE HealthCare and GE Vernova, reducing GE Aerospace\u2019s retained obligations.",
        "Hop 3: GE Aerospace \u2190 GE: GE\u2019s restructuring plan resulted in the separation of its businesses into three distinct entities, with GE Aerospace assuming a reduced share of legacy postretirement liabilities after the spin-offs."

Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\n\nWe  derive  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  from  a  limited  number  of  commercial  airlines. We  can  make  no assurance  that  any  customer  will  exercise  purchase  options,  fulfill  existing  purchase  commitments  or  purchase additional  products  or  services  from  us.  In  addition,  fleet  decisions,  airline  consolidations  or  financial  challenges involving  any  of  our  major  commercial  airline  customers  could  significantly  reduce  our  revenues  and  limit  our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n\nOur Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specification, achieve planned production rate  targets,  successfully  develop  new  aircraft  or  new  derivative  aircraft,  and  meet  or  exceed  stringent performance and reliability standards.\n\nThe commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S.  suppliers,  highly-skilled  labor  from  thousands  of  employees  and  other  partners,  and  stringent  regulatory requirements,  including  the  risk  of  evolving  standards  for  commercial  aircraft  certification,  and  performance  and reliability standards. The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the implementation of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, among them changing the process for certification of commercial aircraft. Comparable agencies that regulate similar matters in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or other similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. The 737 program experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of commercial operations of the 737 MAX aircraft by civil aviation  authorities around the globe. 737 MAX deliveries resumed in late 2020 and early 2021 upon approval of the FAA and other nonU.S. civil aviation authorities. During 2020 and 2021, we experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries, including a pause in 787 deliveries since May 2021. During 2021, this  resulted  in  reprioritizing  production  resources  to  support  inspections  and  rework.  We  continue  to  conduct inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries as well as rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the  contractual  delivery  date.  The  regulators  will  ultimately  determine  the  timing  and  conditions  for  resuming  787 deliveries. Delays on the 737 MAX, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\n\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to  adjust  production  rates  on  several  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs.  During  2021,  we  reprioritized  production resources to support inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft. The 787 program is currently producing at very low rates and expects that to continue until deliveries resume. We are also continuing to implement changes in the production  process  designed  to  ensure  that  newly-built  airplanes  meet  our  specifications  and  do  not  require  further inspections  and  rework.  In  addition,  we  continue  to  seek  opportunities  to  reduce  the  costs  of  building  our  aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory.

      "answer": "GE Energy, as part of GE, retained a portion of the postretirement benefit liabilities totaling approximately $4.2 billion, which includes a share of principal pension plans, other pension plans, and principal retiree benefit plans. These liabilities remain with GE until the planned GE Vernova spin-off. In contrast, MMM manages its postretirement benefit plans with a going-concern investment strategy, targeting a strategic asset allocation with acceptable deviation ranges to reduce funding risk. MMM\u2019s U.S. postretirement benefit plan assets are largely held in a 401(h) account (approximately 83%), which is invested under the same objectives as its primary U.S. pension plan to meet obligations while maximizing returns within actuarially determined limits.",

        "Hop 2: GE Energy \u2192 Postretirement Benefit Plans: The liabilities allocated to GE Energy include approximately $4.2 billion in net postretirement benefit plan liabilities, which were split from GE HealthCare and remain part of continuing operations.",

      "question": "Given GE's cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could disrupt operational commitments, how might EMR's Software and Control backlog growth from $3.3B in 2023 to $3.96B in 2024 expose them to similar supply chain-related cybersecurity risks?",
      "answer": "GE has explicitly outlined that cybersecurity vulnerabilities within supplier systems\u2014especially those embedded in aerospace products\u2014could lead to production downtimes, operational disruptions, and breaches of sensitive data, which could cause them to fall short on customer commitments. EMR\u2019s Software and Control segment has seen a significant increase in backlog, rising from $3.3B in 2023 to $3.96B in 2024, indicating growing reliance on their systems within critical operations. Since EMR operates in a similar industrial technology space and may be a supplier or systems integrator for companies like GE, this backlog growth could mean that EMR\u2019s own cybersecurity posture is increasingly vital to the stability of GE\u2019s supply chain and product security. If EMR experiences a cybersecurity incident, especially amid expanding commitments, it could mirror the risks GE has flagged, potentially leading to delays, reputational damage, or financial penalties.",

        "Hop 3: Software and Control \u2190 EMR: EMR's financial reports show increasing stake in the Software and Control segment, suggesting deeper involvement in systems that could be targeted or exploited, similar to GE\u2019s concerns."

          "chunk_text": "including our policies and controls, will be effective in promptly or effectively detecting, containing or remediating cybersecurity attacks, which may result in material harm to our systems, information or business.\n\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyberattacks of varying degrees of sophistication and various cybersecurity incidents, such as distributed denial of service attacks and phishing attacks. It may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full impact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. This may inhibit our ability to provide prompt, full and reliable information about the incident to our customers, suppliers, regulators and the public. A  significant cy ber-related attack against us, a key  third-party  sy stem or a network that we use, or in our sector, such as an attack on commercial aircraft (even if such an attack does not involve our products, services or systems), could adversely affect our business. The large number of suppliers that we work with requires significant effort for the initial and ongoing v erification of the effectiv e implementation of cy bersecurity  requirements by  suppliers. The increasing degree of interconnectedness that we have with our partners, suppliers and customers also poses a risk to the security of our network as well as the larger ecosystem in which we operate. Our risk mitigation efforts may fail to prevent, detect and limit the impact of cyber-related attacks, and we remain vulnerable to known and unknown cybersecurity threats.\n\nThe continued adoption of new technologies across our business and by our suppliers, including emerging technologies, system migrations and network transitions, also increases our exposure to cybersecurity threats. A ny unknown vulnerability or compromise in our or a third-party product (for example, open source software) exposes our systems, networks, software or connected products to malicious actors that seek to misuse our products, steal intellectual property, misappropriate sensitive, confidential or personal data, or create safety risks or unavailability of equipment. In addition, given the nature of complex systems, software and services like ours, and the scanning tools that we deploy in relation to our networks, infrastructure and products, we regularly identify and track security vulnerabilities. We are not always able to comprehensively apply patches or mitigating measures or ensure that patches are applied before vulnerabilities can be exploited. We also have access to sensitive, classified, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. We are vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming errors and misconfigurations, employee errors (including as a result of social engineering/phishing) and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by insiders or departing employees) that may compromise sensitive, classified, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of or denial of access to information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, a cybersecurity incident that impacts our partners, suppliers or customers could compromise our systems and impact our intellectual property, personal data or other confidential information, or result in production downtimes and operational disruptions that could cause us to breach our commitments to customers. Any security vulnerability or malicious software in a product used by a partner or supplier to deliver a service or embedded in a product that is later integrated into a GE A erospace product could lead to a vulnerability in the security of GE A erospace's product or, if used internally in our network environment, to a compromise of the GE Aerospace network, which may lead to the loss of information or operational disruptions. Cybersecurity-related and data privacy and protection laws and regulatory regimes are evolving, can vary significantly by country and present increasing compliance challenges, and we from time to time receive, and in the future will likely receive, regulatory inquiries about specific incidents or aspects of our cybersecurity framework; these dynamics increase our costs, affect our competitiveness and can expose us to fines or other penalties and reputational risks. In addition, cybersecurity incidents can result in other negative consequences, regardless of whether the direct effects of an incident are significant, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, restoration and remediation costs, increased digital infrastructure or related costs that are not covered by insurance, and costs or fines arising from litigation or regulatory investigations or actions. While we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually  incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\n\nFINANCIAL RISKS. Financial risk relates to our ability  to meet financial goals and obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks. In addition to the risks to financial performance that most of the items described throughout our risk factors pose, financial risks include credit risk; funding and liquidity risks; and volatility  in foreign currency  ex change rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We also face financial risks associated with our run-off insurance and banking operations. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a customer or counterparty failure to meet its contractual obligations. Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability  to meet contractual or contingent financial obligations (whether on- or off-balance sheet) as they arise, and could potentially impact our financial condition, cash flow or overall safety and soundness.\n\nCustomers and counterparties - G lobal economic, industry-specific or other developments that weaken the financial condition, soundness or continuity of significant customers, governments, government programs or other parties we deal with can adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our business and operating results have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the aerospace and defense sector. Activity in our sector is also particularly influenced by the actions of a small group of large original equipment manufacturers, as well as large airlines in v arious geographies. We have significant business with, and credit exposure to, some of our largest customers and accordingly our performance can be adversely affected by challenges that individual customers or the industry faces related to factors such as competition, regulatory oversight and certifications, the need for cost reduction, financial stability and soundness, supply chain or labor shortages or disruptions, the cost of jet fuel, the availability of aircraft leasing and financing alternatives, interest rates, the retirement of older aircraft and other dynamics affecting the original equipment and aftermarket service markets, or by a significant disruption of air trav el demand. Further, changes in the relative value of various national currencies (especially the reduction in the valuation of a home currency against the value of currencies used to purchase and maintain aircraft and aircraft engines) may impact our customers and other industry participants. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining funding or due to macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges that they",

      "answer": "The 26% year-over-year growth in U.S. exports for Emerson in 2024 indicates a strong upward trend in international demand for U.S.-based industrial goods. Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies segment relies on U.S. exports for 11% of its sales, suggesting that it could benefit from this broader export momentum. However, in 2023, Honeywell incurred $139 million in exit costs within that same segment, likely related to restructuring or site transitions, which may have offset or complicated the financial benefits of increased export activity. Therefore, while the external export growth is positive, Honeywell's internal restructuring costs suggest a mixed near-term impact on the segment\u2019s profitability.",

      "answer": "Emerson's Software and Control backlog grew by $655 million in 2024 (from $3.302 billion to $3.957 billion), even as Boeing recorded $16.553 billion in ASC 606 adjustments due to aerospace production instability, particularly for the 777X and 737 MAX programs. This divergence can be explained by Emerson's strategic positioning in automation and control systems that are critical for both new aircraft development and retrofitting existing fleets during production delays. While Boeing's backlog was negatively impacted by delivery delays and customer uncertainty, Emerson may have seen increased demand for its control systems and software solutions that help aerospace manufacturers streamline production processes, improve quality control, and comply with evolving regulatory standards during extended development cycles.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Backlog\n\nOur total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believ e it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospectiv e orders where customer-controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiv ing approv al from its board of directors, shareholders or gov ernment or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or hav e expired prior to recording a new firm order ev en if satisfying such conditions is highly probable. Backlog excludes options and customer financing orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may hav e contractual remedies, including rights to reject indiv idual airplane deliv eries  if  the  actual  deliv ery  date  is  significantly  later  than  the  contractual  deliv ery  date.  We  address  customer  claims  and  requests  for  other contractual  relief  as  they  arise.  T he  v alue  of  orders  in  backlog  is  adjusted  as  changes  to  price  and  schedule  are  agreed  to  with  customers  and  is reported in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606.\n\nBCA total backlog of $435,175 million at December 31, 2024 decreased from $440,507 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting an increase in the v alue of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, cancellations and decreases in estimated contractual prices, partially offset by new orders in excess of deliv eries. Aircraft order cancellations during the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $11,311 million and primarily related to 737 aircraft. Net ASC 606 adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $16,553 million and primarily related to 777X  aircraft. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer-controlled contingency may exist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform, impacts of geopolitical ev ents or related sanctions, or whether it is probable that  the  customer  will  pay  the  full  amount  of  consideration  when  it  is  due.  We  may  experience  reductions  to  backlog  and/or  significant  order cancellations due to v arious factors including deliv ery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into serv ice of the 777X , 737-7 and/or 737-10.\n\nAccounting  Quantity T he  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  deliv ery  under  existing  and anticipated contracts. T he determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the rev enue and cost  of  existing  and  anticipated  contracts.  It  is  a  key  determinant  of  the  gross  margins  we  recognize  on  sales  of  indiv idual  airplanes  throughout  a program's life. Estimation of each program's accounting quantity takes into account sev eral factors that are indicativ e of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospectiv e customers and market studies. We rev iew our program accounting quantities quarterly.\n\nThe accounting quantity for each program may include units that hav e been deliv ered, undeliv ered units under contract and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In dev eloping total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.",

          "chunk_text": "\nAeronautics' net sales in 2021 increased $482 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher  net  sales  of  approximately  $290  million  on  classified  contracts  due  to  higher  volume;  about  $180  million  for  the  F-16 program due to higher volume on production contracts that was partially offset by lower sustainment volume; approximately $75 million for the F-35 program primarily due to higher volume on production and sustainment contracts that was partially offset by lower  volume  on  development  contracts;  and  about  $30  million  for  the  C-130  program  primarily  due  to  higher  volume  on production contracts and higher risk retirements on sustainment activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $170 million for lower sustainment volume for the F-22 program.\n\nAeronautics' operating profit in 2021 decreased $44 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $120 million for classified contracts primarily due to a $225 million loss recognized in the  second  quarter  of  2021  for  performance  issues  experienced  on  a  classified  program  that  was  partially  offset  by  higher  risk retirements on other classified programs recognized in the second half of 2021; and about $70 million for the F-35 program due to lower risk retirements and volume on development contracts and lower risk retirements on production contracts that were partially offset  by  higher  risk  retirements  and  volume  on  sustainment  contracts.  These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  an  increase  of approximately $90 million for the C-130 program due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts; and about $50 million for  the  F-16  program  due  to  higher  risk  retirements  on  sustainment  contracts  and  higher  production  volume. Adjustments  not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $60 million lower in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n## Backlog\n\nBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to prolonged negotiations for F-35 production contracts resulting in lower orders in 2021.\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect Aeronautics' 2022 net sales to increase in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by growth in F-16, F-22 and classified volume. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low-single digit range above 2021 levels. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be in line with 2021 levels.\n\n## Missiles and Fire Control\n\nOur  MFC  business  segment  provides  air  and  missile  defense  systems;  tactical  missiles  and  air-to-ground  precision  strike weapon  systems;  logistics;  fire  control  systems;  mission  operations  support,  readiness,  engineering  support  and  integration services;  manned  and  unmanned  ground  vehicles;  and  energy  management  solutions.  MFC's  major  programs  include  PAC-3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Hellfire, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Apache fire control system, Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (SNIPER\u00ae), Infrared Search and Track (IRST21\u00ae) and Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS).

      "answer": "UPS reported a significant increase in foreign currency exchange contracts, rising from $56 million in 2020 to $100 million in 2021 on the current asset side of the balance sheet, reflecting heightened exposure to currency fluctuations. Meanwhile, 3M's total sales change increased from 3.5% in 2020 to 10.3% in 2021, driven in part by a 1.0 percentage point contribution from translation effects. Regionally, 3M experienced double-digit sales growth in Asia Pacific (10.8%) and Europe, Middle East & Africa (9.0%), which were likely influenced by exchange rate movements. The rise in market volatility\u2014evident from both UPS's expanded derivative positions and 3M's stronger translation effect\u2014suggests both companies faced increased foreign exchange risk in 2021, prompting more active financial risk management as seen in UPS's larger hedging activity and 3M's geographic performance variation.",

      "answer": "A 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense for both Honeywell and FedEx. For Honeywell, which plans to use a 7.00% expected rate of return for 2024, a decrease in this assumption would likely increase their pension expense, though the exact dollar impact is not disclosed. FedEx quantifies this sensitivity: a 50 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by $127 million. Additionally, FedEx\u2019s pension benefit obligation (PBO) would increase by $1,498 million under this scenario, amplifying the long-term financial impact.",

        "Hop 1: HON \u2192 Pension Expense: Honeywell plans to use a 7.00% expected rate of return on plan assets for 2024, up from the prior year, which affects pension expense sensitivity.",

      "answer": "FDX's U.S. pension plan was underfunded by $2,732 million in 2022, an increase from the $1,638 million underfunding in 2021, indicating worsening pension liability pressures. In contrast, UPS maintained a consistent cash balance interest credit rate of 2.50% in both 2021 and 2020, suggesting a stable crediting strategy despite potential funding challenges. This divergence implies that FDX may be facing greater strain in meeting its pension obligations, while UPS is prioritizing predictability in benefit accruals, potentially signaling different philosophies in managing retirement liabilities.",

      "answer": "Collins Aerospace's 'Other Segment Items' decreased from $21,111 million in 2023 to $175 million in 2024, a significant drop of $20,936 million. In contrast, Honeywell allocated a total of $2,668 million to 'Other Segment Items' across its business segments in 2024 (sum of $1,044M + $817M + $423M + $384M). This suggests that while RTX (via Collins Aerospace) drastically reduced its other segment costs, potentially consolidating or eliminating certain expenses, Honeywell maintained a more distributed and substantial allocation of such costs across its diversified business units.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: RTX \u2192 Collins Aerospace: RTX has a major stake in Collins Aerospace, which reported a sharp decline in 'Other Segment Items' from $21,111 million in 2023 to $175 million in 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Collins Aerospace \u2192 Other Segment Items: The significant drop in 'Other Segment Items' for Collins Aerospace indicates a strategic shift or cost reallocation in 2024.",
        "Hop 3: Other Segment Items \u2190 HON: Honeywell's 2024 allocation of 'Other Segment Items' across its segments totals $2,668 million, showing a more sustained and distributed cost structure compared to RTX\u2019s sharp reduction."

      "answer": "CAT's Financial Products Segment reported a $318 million drop in profit in 2024, which represents a significant but relatively contained impact on its consolidated operating profit. In contrast, BA experienced a much larger $6,562 million cumulative catch-up adjustment in 2024 due to changes in revenue and cost estimates on long-term contracts, particularly for fixed-price development programs such as the KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. While CAT's decline reflects segment-specific performance, BA's adjustment highlights a broader structural risk tied to contract estimation and execution volatility, significantly amplifying earnings instability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\n## Accounting for Long-term Contracts\n\nSubstantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or serv ices and the significant serv ice of integration that we prov ide.\n\nAccounting for long-term contracts inv olv es a judgmental process of estimating the total rev enue, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and rev enue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.\n\nDue to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total rev enues and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many v ariables. T otal rev enue estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract  options,  change  orders,  incentiv e  and  award  fee  prov isions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  as inflation  or  index-based  clauses).  T he  majority  of  these  long-term  contracts  are  with  the  U.S.  gov ernment  where  the  price  is  generally  based  on  the estimated  cost  to  produce  the  product  or  serv ice  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  prov ide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be reimbursed  in  establishing  contract  price.  T otal  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and supplier performance trends, production quality, labor instability, supply chain delays and quality issues, business v olume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.\n\nRevenue and cost estimates for all significant  long-term  contract  performance  obligations  are  rev iewed  and  reassessed  quarterly.  Changes  in  these estimates could result in recognition of cumulativ e catch-up adjustments to the contract's inception to date rev enues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in rev enue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reachforward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. Net cumulativ e catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated rev enues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts, including the impact of estimated losses on unexercised options, increased Loss from operations by $6,562 million, $2,943 million and $5,253 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely, and were primarily due to losses recognized on the KC-46A T anker, T -7A Red Hawk, Commercial Crew, VC-25B, and MQ-25 programs. These are all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.\n\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described abov e, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different  assumptions  or  if  the  underlying  circumstances  were  to  change.  For  example,  changes  in  underlying  operational  assumptions,  inability  to implement  planned  risk  mitigation  plans,  failure  to  achiev e  productiv ity  targets,  supplier  shortages,  quality  issues  and/or  pricing  issues,  inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adv ersely affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts  had  been  estimated  to  be  higher  or  lower  by  1%  during  2024,  it  would  hav e  increased  or  decreased  pre-tax  income  for  the  year  by approximately $290 million.\n\n## Program Accounting\n\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate rev enues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number",

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. In connection with the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - 'Risk Factors,' which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement the Company's financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain 'non-GAAP financial measures,' as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management's control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the Company's financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nUnderlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure: net sales ).\n\nOperating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings",

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses. Refer to 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' for further  details.  While  we  have  seen  indications  that  commercial  air  travel  is  recovering,  we  continue  to  closely  monitor  our commercial aerospace assets for recoverability and our off-balance sheet exposures. The following summarizes certain significant assets and off-balance sheet exposures specifically related to our commercial aerospace customers:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2024, Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) experienced a $1,015 million revenue decline primarily due to unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments on major fixed-price development programs. Despite this, Boeing maintained its strategic investment in the segment, exemplified by its $557 million equity stake in United Launch Alliance under BDS. This suggests continued confidence in long-term defense and space capabilities despite short-term financial pressures. Lockheed Martin also faces similar risks, as its fixed-price development contracts can lead to significant financial exposure due to cost overruns, which could impact margins and future program bidding strategies. Thus, both companies are navigating similar contract risk structures, yet Boeing continues to invest in BDS, indicating a strategic commitment to the segment's future despite current financial headwinds.",

When this occurs, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident.\n\nUnder both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected. Costs to complete a contract may increase for many reasons, including technical and manufacturing challenges, schedule delays, workforce-related issues, inaccurate initial contract cost estimates, the timeliness and availability of materials from suppliers, internal and subcontractor performance or product quality issues, inability to meet cost reduction initiatives or achieve efficiencies from digital transformation, changing laws or regulations, inflation and natural disasters. Certain contracts may impose other risks, such as forfeiting fees, paying penalties, or providing replacement systems in the event of performance failure.\n\nContracts for development programs include complex design and technical requirements and are often contracted on a cost-reimbursable basis, however, some of our  existing  development  programs  are  contracted  on  a  fix ed-price  basis.  In  addition,  we  have  certain  contracts  where  we  bid  upfront  on  cost-reimbursable development work and the follow-on fixed-price production options in one submission. We expect we also will bid on similar programs in the future. Fixed-price development work or fixed-price production options, especially on competitively bid programs, is inherently riskier than cost-reimbursable work because the revenue is  fix ed,  while  the  estim ates  of  costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability due to the nature of development programs. The technical complexity coupled with the fixed-price contract structure of certain of our ongoing development programs or new programs increases the risk that our costs will be greater than anticipated, resulting in reduced margins, operating profit, or reach-forward losses during the period of contract performance or upon contract award, all of which could be significant to our financial condition and operating results. Bidding upfront on fixed-price production options increases the risk that we may experience lower margins than expected, or a loss, on the production options because we must estimate the cost of producing a product before it has been  developed.  These  risks  may  cause  us  not  to  bid  on  certain  future  programs,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  future  growth  prospects  and  financial performance. See Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about losses incurred on certain programs, including fixed-price development programs.\n\nContracts for the transition from development to production (e.g., low rate initial production (LRIP) contracts) also create performance and financial risks to our business because of the challenge of starting and stabilizing a manufacturing production and test line while concurrently validating final design and managing change in requirements or capabilities requested by the customer.\n\nMany of our contracts include multiple option years exercisable at the customer's discretion, which carries risk. The customer may decline to exercise an option, or the customer may exercise an option on a contract for which we expect to incur a loss or perform at a low margin, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nWe are routinely subject to audit by our customers on government contracts, including audits relating to our disclosed Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) rate structure or any changes to our CAS rate structure and the results of those audits could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations\n\nU.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and various agency Inspectors G eneral, routinely  audit  and  investigate  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  a  contractor's  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  contract  terms, regarding, among other things, contract pricing, contract performance, cost structure and business systems. U.S. G overnment audits and investigations often take years to complete, and many result in no adverse action against us. Like many U.S. G overnment contractors, we have received audit and investigative reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices or that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. Similarly, like other U.S. G overnment contractors, audits and investigations also occur related to cost reimbursements that are based upon our final allowable incurred costs for each year. We have unaudited or unsettled incurred cost claims related to past years, which limits our ability to issue final billings on contracts for which authorized and appropriated funds may be expiring or can result in delays in final billings and our ability to close out a contract. These audits could result in unanticipated changes to contract prices and the amount and timing of payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.\n\nIf  an  audit  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  may  be  subject  to  civil  or  criminal  penalties  and  administrative  sanctions,  including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, penalties, fines or suspension or  debarment from doing business with the U.S. G overnment.  Reductions in the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, penalties, and fines could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in any particular reporting period, and suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence on contracts with the U.S. G overnment. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Similar government oversight and risks to our business and reputation exist in most other countries where we conduct business.",

      "answer": "GE's run-off insurance operations generated a profit of $1.022 billion in 2024, suggesting relative stability or even strength in certain financial sectors despite broader economic conditions. In contrast, Caterpillar's Construction Industries segment expects a profit decline in early 2025 due to lower machine sales volume and unfavorable price realization, signaling softness in construction demand. This divergence implies that while financial services (like insurance) may be performing well, the physical construction sector is experiencing headwinds, potentially reflecting a decoupling of financial sector resilience from real-economy activity in construction during this period.",

Meanwhile, MMM's 2024 report indicates that 'Corporate & Other' is not a reportable segment and does not meet segment reporting criteria, suggesting it plays a less strategic or smaller role in MMM\u2019s structure.

      "question": "How does the transitional accounting treatment of postretirement benefit liabilities for GE Energy ahead of the GE Vernova spin-off compare to Lockheed Martin's consolidated approach for similar obligations in their 2023 financial statements?",
      "answer": "GE Energy, as part of GE's restructuring ahead of the planned GE Vernova spin-off in 2023, had postretirement benefit liabilities legally allocated and remained with GE until the spin-off, with net liabilities of approximately $4.2 billion, including portions of principal pension plans, other pension plans, and principal retiree benefit plans, transferred to GE HealthCare and reported in discontinued operations. In contrast, Lockheed Martin (LMT) maintained a consolidated GAAP approach in 2023, where postretirement benefit plans were included in their significant accounting policies as part of ongoing operations, with assumptions and estimates made for future benefit payments and funding obligations. Unlike GE Energy\u2019s transitional split, LMT did not indicate any legal reallocation or spin-off-related changes to its postretirement benefit structure in its 2023 disclosures.",

        "Hop 3: Postretirement Benefit Plans \u2190 LMT: Lockheed Martin included postretirement benefit plans in its consolidated financial statements under GAAP, with no indication of legal reallocation or separation, and used estimates and assumptions for benefit payments and funding obligations in 2023."

      "answer": "RTX's 2024 segment revenue shows a diversified profile with Collins Aerospace contributing $4,135 million (47% of total segment revenue), Raytheon at $2,594 million (30%), and Pratt & Whitney at $2,015 million (23%). This diversification may insulate RTX from volatility in any one defense sector. In contrast, GD's Marine Systems segment accounted for 30% of its consolidated revenue in 2024, indicating a more concentrated exposure to naval defense programs. GD specifically noted that the Marine Systems segment continues to face supply chain disruptions from global events, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, while both companies have significant defense exposure, GD may face greater operational risk from sector-specific volatility\u2014particularly in marine defense\u2014while RTX's broader segment mix could provide more stability.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(Dollars in millions, ex cept per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)\n\nFor an overview of our operating segm ents, including a discussion of our m ajor products and services, see the Business discussion contained in Item 1. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2024 com pared with 2023 should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statem ents included in Item  8, while a discussion of 2023 com pared with 2022 can be found in Item  7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n## GLOBAL EVENTS\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruptions to national and global econom ies and governm ent activities, including supply chain and staffing challenges. Additionally , in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and several other countries im posed economic and trade sanctions, export controls and other restrictions targeting Russia and Belarus. Lastly , the im pact of the conflict in the Middle East continues to evolve. The disruptions caused by these events continue to im pact global econom ies and businesses, including ours. The prim ary im pact to our business is supply chain challenges, including availability of parts, quality escapes and inflationary pressures.\n\nIn our Aerospace segment, supply chain challenges paced our ability to ram p up production at the rate we like in response to strong custom er demand for our aircraft, causing out-of-sequence m anufacturing that increased costs and decreased operational efficiency . In addition, the conflict in the Middle East im pacted the delivery schedule for our Israel-based supplier of m id-cabin aircraft. Within our defense segm ents, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in supply chain challenges that continue to im pact our Marine System s segm ent. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and increased threat environment have created additional dem and for certain of our products and services, particularly in our Com bat System s segm ent.\n\nAny longer-term impact of these global events to our business is currently unknown due to the uncertainty around duration and their broader i m pact. For additional inform ation, see the Risk Factors in Part I, Item  1A.\n\n## OUR MARKETS\n\nWith approximately 70% of our revenue from the U.S. government, government spending levels  - particularly defense spending - influence our fi n an ci al   perf orm an ce.  The  Congress  has  not  yet  passed  a  defense  appropriations  bill  for  the  governm ent's  current  fiscal  year.  However,  the government has been operating under a continuing resolution (CR) that provides funding for som e federal agencies through March 14, 2025. When the government operates under a CR, all program s of record are funded at the prior year's appropriated levels until the current year appropriations bil l  i s si g n ed i n to l aw .

      "question": "How might FedEx Ground's 10% increase in maintenance and repairs expense influence UPS's capacity planning strategies that rely on third-party ground freight networks, given both companies' DRIVE efficiency initiatives?",
      "answer": "FedEx Ground's 10% increase in maintenance and repairs expense in 2024, driven by higher costs for outside vendor labor, vehicle parts, and facility maintenance, could constrain its ability to expand ground freight capacity while maintaining profitability. This cost pressure may limit FedEx's ability to offer competitive pricing or capacity to third-party networks like those used by UPS. Since UPS strategically combines its own fleet with a broad third-party carrier network to create capacity solutions, rising costs at FedEx could push UPS to seek alternative carriers or accelerate its own automation investments mentioned in its logistics segment. Both companies are pursuing efficiency initiatives\u2014FedEx through DRIVE cost reductions and UPS through facility automation\u2014which means UPS may need to recalibrate its reliance on external networks like FedEx's if maintenance cost pressures persist.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: FDX \u2192 Maintenance and Repairs Expense: FedEx Express maintenance costs decreased 5% due to fewer aircraft in service, while FedEx Ground saw a 10% increase in maintenance expense driven by vehicle and facility costs.",
        "Hop 2: Maintenance and Repairs Expense \u2192 FedEx Ground: FedEx Ground specifically experienced a 10% increase in maintenance and repairs expense in 2024, primarily due to higher costs for outside vendor labor, vehicle parts, and facility maintenance.",
        "Hop 3: FedEx Ground \u2190 UPS: UPS relies on a combination of its own fleet and a broad third-party carrier network\u2014including potentially FedEx Ground capacity\u2014to create ground freight solutions for customers across North America and Europe."

      "question": "How does the contribution of Raytheon Intelligence & Space to RTX's 2022 consolidated net sales compare with Emerson's (EMR) expected growth in consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023, given their respective revenue disclosures?",
      "answer": "Raytheon Intelligence & Space contributed $15,180 million in net sales to RTX's 2022 consolidated net sales of $64,388 million, representing approximately 23.6% of total revenue. In comparison, Emerson (EMR) expects its consolidated net sales from continuing operations to grow by 7 to 9 percent in fiscal 2023. This comparison highlights that RTX's Raytheon Intelligence & Space segment plays a significant role in its revenue base, while EMR anticipates more modest but forward-looking growth in its continuing operations.",

The updates also eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.\n\n## FISCAL 2023 OUTLOOK\n\nFollowing the announcement of its Climate Technologies divestiture, Emerson will report financial results for Climate Technologies, InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc as discontinued operations for all periods presented, beginning in 2023. The earnings from discontinued operations for 2023 are expected to be $10 billion to $11 billion, or $17 to $19 per share, including the net gains on 2023 divestitures.\n\nEmerson expects order strength and backlog to support fiscal 2023 sales growth. For the full year, consolidated net sales from continuing operations are expected to be up 7 to 9 percent, with underlying sales up 6.5 to 8.5 percent excluding a 3.5 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 4 percent favorable impact from acquisitions net of divestitures.\n\nEarnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be $3.51 to $3.66 (which excludes any potential impact from the 45 percent common equity ownership in Climate Technologies' income or loss post-close), while adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $4.00 to $4.15, excluding a $0.13 per share impact from restructuring actions, a $0.61 per share impact from amortization of intangibles, $0.10 per share from interest income on the Climate Technologies note receivable, and $0.15 per share of interest income on undeployed proceeds from the Climate Technologies and InSinkErator divestitures.\n\nThe Company's fiscal 2023 results from continuing operations after the Climate Technologies divestiture (assumed to close March 31, 2023 for purposes of the guidance above) will include interest income from the $2.25 billion note receivable from Climate Technologies and reflect the 45 percent common equity ownership in the income, or loss, of Climate Technologies. Emerson will not control Climate Technologies post-closing and is therefore unable to estimate the amount of its 45 percent share of Climate Technologies' post-close results. The Company will exclude the interest income from the note receivable from Climate Technologies and its 45 percent share of Climate Technologies' operations in its calculation of fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share. Also excluded from adjusted earnings per share is the interest income on any undeployed net proceeds. The effect of Emerson's 45 percent share of Climate Technologies is expected to be immaterial to post-closing cash flows. The fiscal 2023 outlook assumes approximately $1.2 billion of dividend payments and approximately $2 billion to be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.\n\n## ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nThe information from this Annual Report on Form 10-K set forth in Item 7 under \"Financial Instruments\" is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n## ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nSee the Company's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the report thereon of KPMG LLP (PCAOB ID 185) that follow.",

      "question": "As both GE Aerospace and Lockheed Martin navigate complex legacy obligations in the aerospace sector, how does the specificity and scale of their disclosed postretirement liabilities compare, particularly with GE Aerospace's allocated $4.2 billion in liabilities and Lockheed Martin's qualitative mention of postretirement plans as a significant accounting estimate?",
      "answer": "GE Aerospace, as part of GE's restructuring in 2023, had approximately $4.2 billion in net postretirement benefit plan liabilities allocated to it, including portions of principal pension and retiree benefit plans. This quantified exposure reflects a formal transfer of liabilities as part of GE\u2019s strategic separation. In contrast, Lockheed Martin (LMT) disclosed in its 2023 10-K that postretirement benefit plans are among the significant estimates inherent in its financial reporting, but did not provide a specific dollar amount. This difference in specificity suggests that while GE Aerospace has taken a concrete step in isolating and quantifying its legacy benefit obligations as part of its spin-off planning, Lockheed Martin continues to treat these obligations as part of broader accounting estimates, without a detailed public breakdown.",

        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Postretirement Benefit Plans: LMT identifies postretirement benefit plans as a significant accounting estimate affecting financial statements, but does not quantify the liability.",

        "Hop 3: GE Aerospace \u2190 GE: GE Aerospace is one of the three segments resulting from GE\u2019s strategic restructuring, and its postretirement liabilities remain with GE until the planned GE Vernova spin-off."

      "question": "How did the decrease in Other Operating Expense impact FedEx Ground's operating income growth in 2024, and how might this cost management strategy compare to UPS's approach in leveraging ground freight capacity solutions through third-party networks?",
      "answer": "The decrease in Other Operating Expense contributed to FedEx Ground's 29% increase in operating income in 2024, primarily driven by lower self-insurance accruals and cost-reduction initiatives under DRIVE. This cost discipline, combined with yield improvement and higher volume, allowed FedEx Ground to improve profitability despite increased depreciation and maintenance costs from completed expansion projects. Meanwhile, UPS leverages a combination of its own fleet and a broad third-party carrier network to create ground freight capacity solutions, suggesting a different strategy focused on network flexibility rather than direct cost reduction. While FedEx focused on internal cost controls, UPS emphasized network integration and scalability to meet customer demand across industries.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: FDX \u2192 Other Operating Expense: FedEx Express's Other Operating Expense decreased 8% in 2024, primarily due to lower bad debt and temporary labor costs, contributing to overall expense reduction.",
        "Hop 2: Other Operating Expense \u2192 FedEx Ground: FedEx Ground's Other Operating Expense decreased 5% in 2024, mainly due to lower self-insurance accruals, which directly contributed to a 29% increase in operating income.",
        "Hop 3: FedEx Ground \u2190 UPS: UPS leverages both its own fleet and a broad third-party carrier network to create ground freight capacity solutions, indicating a strategic contrast with FedEx Ground's cost-reduction focus."

Boeing discloses its pension funded status and PBO balances but does not provide a specific sensitivity analysis for a 50 basis point rate change.

      "answer": "In 2024, Lockheed Martin's MFC segment recognized $1.4 billion in reach-forward losses on a classified program, indicating significant financial exposure tied to cost overruns or performance risks on fixed-price contracts. Similarly, Boeing highlighted ongoing financial risk from reach-forward losses on its fixed-price development programs such as Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, and VC-25B, noting that technical complexity and schedule delays could trigger additional losses. Both companies face exposure from fixed-price contracts where cost growth outpaces estimated revenue, but LMT's MFC segment explicitly recognized a large loss in 2024, whereas BA emphasized forward-looking risk rather than a specific dollar amount already recorded. This suggests that while both companies are exposed to similar types of risk, LMT has already realized a major financial impact, while BA continues to carry uncertainty about future charges.",

Net unfav orable cumulativ e contract catch-up adjustments were $2,328 million better than in 2022.\n\nSee further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nBDS loss from operations includes our share of income from equity method inv estments of $125 million, $44 million and $13 million primarily from our United Launch Alliance and other joint v entures in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## Backlog\n\nT otal backlog of $64,023 million at December 31, 2024 was $5,011 million higher than December 31, 2023, reflecting the timing of awards, partially offset by rev enue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of dev elopment programs which hav e complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs hav e cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentiv e fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price dev elopment programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  T anker,  MQ-25,  T -7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites. A  number  of  our  ongoing  fixed-price  dev elopment programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also hav e risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during dev elopment, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adv ersely  affect  our  financial  condition.  T hese  programs  are  ongoing,  and  while  we  believ e  the  cost  and  fee estimates  incorporated  in  the  financial  statements  are  appropriate,  the  technical  complexity  of  these  programs  creates  financial  risk  as  additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled deliv ery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination prov isions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n## Global Services\n\n## Business Environment and Trends\n\nThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inv entory serv ices; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional  serv ices;  and  data  analytics  and  digital  serv ices.  We  expect  BGS  commercial  rev enues  to  remain  strong  in  future  quarters  as  the commercial airline industry transitions from recov ery to growth.\n\nOver  the  long-term,  as  the  size  of  the  worldwide  commercial  airline  fleet  continues  to  grow ,  so  does  demand  for  aftermarket  serv ices  designed  to increase efficiency and extend the economic liv es of aircraft. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictiv e maintenance to improve their productiv ity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inv entory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.",

The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract and variable considerations. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to the  technical,  schedule  and  cost  aspects  of  the  contract,  which  decreases  the  estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. The profit booking rate may also be adjusted if the total estimated value of the contract changes or there is a contract modification. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. For further discussion on fixed-price contracts, see 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nChanges in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume, contract mix, and/or performance (referred to as profit booking rate adjustments). Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. Contract mix primarily  refers  to  changes  in  the  ratio  of  contract  type  or  life  cycle  (e.g.,  cost-type,  fix ed-price,  development,  production  and/or  sustainment)  and  other  cost recoveries.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit booking rate adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit booking rate adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inceptionto-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin can be impacted favorably or unfavorably by, for example, certain items listed below, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items include the adverse resolution of contractual matters, supply chain disruptions, restructuring charges (except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results), reserves for disputes, certain asset impairments, and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nOur  consolidated  net  profit  booking  rate  adjustments  decreased  segment  operating  profit  by  approx imately  $180  million  in  2024  and  increased  segment operating profit by $1.6 billion in 2023. The impact in 2024 includes losses of $555 million recognized on a classified program at our Aeronautics business segment, reach-forward losses of $1.4 billion recognized on a classified program at our MFC business segment and $155 million of favorable profit rate adjustments following the resolution of a long-standing claim associated with a completed C-5 G alaxy aircraft contract. The impact in 2023 included an unfavorable profit adjustment of $100 million on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program (CMHP) and a $65 million favorable profit adjustment as a result of a positive resolution of a contractual matter on an international surveillance and control program at our RMS business segment. See the discussions under 'Revenue Recognition' in 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\n## Aeronautics\n\nOur Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics' major programs include the F-35 Lightning II, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics' operating results included the following (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How does a 50 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets impact RTX's pension expense risk compared to FDX's exposure, given RTX's reliance on actuarial assumptions and FDX's quantified sensitivity analysis?",
      "answer": "A 50 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets would increase RTX's pension expense risk due to its reliance on actuarial assumptions like EROA, which significantly influence pension costs. FDX's sensitivity analysis shows that a 50 basis point decrease in EROA raises pension expense by $127 million. This quantified exposure at FDX highlights how similar shifts in EROA could materially affect RTX, which also depends on EROA and other assumptions that are subject to change, potentially leading to increased pension liabilities and negatively impacting RTX's financial condition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: RTX \u2192 Pension Expense: RTX's pension expense is highly sensitive to actuarial assumptions, particularly the expected return on plan assets (EROA), and changes in these assumptions can significantly affect its financial results.",
        "Hop 2: Pension Expense \u2192 50 Basis Point Decrease: A 50 basis point decrease in EROA increases FDX's pension expense by $127 million, as shown in their sensitivity analysis, illustrating the material financial impact of such a shift.",
        "Hop 3: 50 Basis Point Decrease \u2190 FDX: FDX's quantified exposure to EROA changes provides a concrete example of how pension expenses can rise under similar conditions, offering a comparative lens to assess RTX's risk profile."

UPS's International Package segment reported $3,231 million in operating profit for 2023, showing a much larger scale of profitability. However, UPS's segment also saw a 25.1% decline in operating profit year-over-year (from $4,326 million in 2022), suggesting efficiency pressures similar to RTX's challenges but within a more substantial revenue base. This comparison highlights different scales of operational efficiency considerations across industries.",

      "answer": "Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies segment had 13% of its sales attributed to U.S. exports in 2021, indicating a moderate reliance on international demand for its products. In contrast, Emerson reported $1.5 billion in U.S. exports for 2022, representing a 33% increase compared to 2021, which highlights a growing dependence on international markets. Both companies operate in sectors where international trade plays a key role, with Emerson's export growth being significantly influenced by acquisitions like Heritage AspenTech, which added approximately $200 million to U.S. export sales.",

U.S. exports of $1.5 billion were up 33 percent compared with 2021, including an increase of approximately $200 due to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. Underlying international destination sales were up 6 percent, as foreign currency translation had a 5 percent unfavorable impact on the comparison, the AspenTech acquisition added 2 percent and the Therm-O-Disc divestiture subtracted 1 percent. Underlying sales increased 2 percent in Europe, 5 percent in Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa (China up 7 percent), 19 percent in Latin America and 15 percent in Canada. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $9.2 billion in 2022, down 1 percent compared with 2021.\n\nInternational destination sales, including U.S. exports, increased 10 percent, to $10.3 billion in 2021, reflecting increases in both the Automation Solutions and Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions businesses. U.S. exports of $1.1 billion were up 12 percent compared with 2020. Underlying international destination sales were up 5 percent, as foreign currency translation had a 4 percent favorable impact on the comparison and the OSI acquisition added 1 percent. Underlying sales increased 5 percent in Europe, 5 percent in Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa (China up 15 percent), 9 percent in Latin America and 1 percent in Canada. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $9.3 billion in 2021, up 9 percent compared with 2020.\n\n## ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\nPortfolio management is an integral component of Emerson's growth and value creation strategy. Over the past 18 months, Emerson has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and divestitures of non-core businesses. These actions were undertaken to create a higher growth and cohesive industrial technology portfolio as a global automation leader serving a diversified set of end markets with differentiated capabilities in intelligent devices and software. The Company's recent portfolio actions include the following transactions.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in fiscal 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone (\"Blackstone\") in a transaction valued at $14.0 billion. Emerson will receive upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.5 billion and a note of $2.25 billion at close (which will accrue 5 percent interest payable in kind by capitalizing interest), while retaining a 45 percent noncontrolling common equity ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The Climate Technologies business, which includes the Copeland compressor business and the entire portfolio of products and services across all residential and commercial HVAC and refrigeration end-markets, had fiscal 2022 net sales of approximately $5.0 billion and pretax earnings of $1.0 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The Company expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $10 billion (approximately $8 billion after-tax) in fiscal 2023 upon the completion of the transaction.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion. This business had net sales of $630 and pretax earnings of $152 in fiscal 2022 and is reported in the Tools &amp; Home Products segment. The assets and liabilities of InSinkErator were classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2022 and are included in other current assets, other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects to recognize a pretax gain of approximately $2.8 billion (approximately $2.1 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nOn May 16, 2022, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by its definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"Heritage AspenTech\") to contribute two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectively, the 'Emerson Industrial Software Business'), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (hereinafter referred to as \"AspenTech\"). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson beneficially owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis) and former Heritage AspenTech stockholders owned the remaining outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock. AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's previous name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under Heritage AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.' On a pro forma basis, AspenTech had fiscal 2022 net sales of $1.1 billion.",

      "question": "How does the growth in GE's equity method investment balance in the Aerospace segment from 2022 to 2023 compare to Honeywell's Aerospace segment net repositioning charges over the same period, and what might this indicate about their respective strategic focuses in the sector?",
      "answer": "GE's equity method investment balance in Aerospace increased from $1,931 million in 2022 to $1,958 million in 2023, reflecting a modest growth of $27 million. In contrast, Honeywell's Aerospace segment reported net repositioning charges of $23 million in 2023, down from $41 million in 2022, indicating a reduction in restructuring activity. This suggests GE is maintaining or slightly increasing its strategic stake in Aerospace through equity investments, while Honeywell is winding down its repositioning efforts in the same segment.",

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses. Refer to 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' for further  details.

The updates also eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.\n\n## FISCAL 2023 OUTLOOK\n\nFollowing the announcement of its Climate Technologies divestiture, Emerson will report financial results for Climate Technologies, InSinkErator and Therm-O-Disc as discontinued operations for all periods presented, beginning in 2023. The earnings from discontinued operations for 2023 are expected to be $10 billion to $11 billion, or $17 to $19 per share, including the net gains on 2023 divestitures.\n\nEmerson expects order strength and backlog to support fiscal 2023 sales growth. For the full year, consolidated net sales from continuing operations are expected to be up 7 to 9 percent, with underlying sales up 6.5 to 8.5 percent excluding a 3.5 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 4 percent favorable impact from acquisitions net of divestitures.\n\nEarnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be $3.51 to $3.66 (which excludes any potential impact from the 45 percent common equity ownership in Climate Technologies' income or loss post-close), while adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $4.00 to $4.15, excluding a $0.13 per share impact from restructuring actions, a $0.61 per share impact from amortization of intangibles, $0.10 per share from interest income on the Climate Technologies note receivable, and $0.15 per share of interest income on undeployed proceeds from the Climate Technologies and InSinkErator divestitures.\n\nThe Company's fiscal 2023 results from continuing operations after the Climate Technologies divestiture (assumed to close March 31, 2023 for purposes of the guidance above) will include interest income from the $2.25 billion note receivable from Climate Technologies and reflect the 45 percent common equity ownership in the income, or loss, of Climate Technologies. Emerson will not control Climate Technologies post-closing and is therefore unable to estimate the amount of its 45 percent share of Climate Technologies' post-close results. The Company will exclude the interest income from the note receivable from Climate Technologies and its 45 percent share of Climate Technologies' operations in its calculation of fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share. Also excluded from adjusted earnings per share is the interest income on any undeployed net proceeds. The effect of Emerson's 45 percent share of Climate Technologies is expected to be immaterial to post-closing cash flows. The fiscal 2023 outlook assumes approximately $1.2 billion of dividend payments and approximately $2 billion to be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.\n\n## ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nThe information from this Annual Report on Form 10-K set forth in Item 7 under \"Financial Instruments\" is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n## ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nSee the Company's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the report thereon of KPMG LLP (PCAOB ID 185) that follow.",
