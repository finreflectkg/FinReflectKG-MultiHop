      "question": "How do Disney, Google, and Verizon each characterize the growth or decline in their Domestic Revenue in 2024, and what does this reveal about the varying dynamics in the Communication Services sector?",
      "answer": "Disney reported a 10% year-over-year increase in Domestic Revenue for ESPN, reaching $3,763 million in 2024. Google experienced a significant jump in Domestic Revenue, rising from $73,600 million in 2023 to $108,076 million in 2024. In contrast, Verizon saw a decline in Domestic Revenue, falling from $26,822 million in 2022 to $21,253 million in 2024. These trends highlight differing sector dynamics: ESPN benefits from strong domestic media performance, Google sees robust domestic ad and cloud growth, while Verizon faces domestic market saturation or competitive pressures.",

      "question": "How do Disney, Google, and AT&T each quantify or characterize their exposure to rising content costs, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies in managing media programming and distribution expenses?",
      "answer": "Disney highlights that rising content costs, particularly for sports programming rights, could impact profitability and depend on advertising markets, subscription levels, and audience size. Google reports paying content acquisition costs for video and other content on YouTube and Google Play, based on revenues generated or flat fees, indicating a direct link between content costs and platform monetization. AT&T specifically notes increased content costs associated with plans bundling HBO Max, contributing to higher operations and support expenses. Together, this shows that while all three companies face rising content costs, Disney is concerned with rights renewal terms, Google ties costs to content provider revenue shares, and AT&T experiences direct cost increases from content bundling strategies.",

        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 Content Costs: Disney notes that the cost of programming rights (especially sports) has increased and may continue to rise, impacting profitability depending on advertising, subscriptions, and audience size.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. As a result, our portfolio of programming rights and the distributors of our programming have changed and may continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, have demanded and may continue to demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution, the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms and the impacts of COVID-19. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. There can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.\n\n## Changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.\n\nOur broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of U.S. and overseas regulations. Some of these regulations include:\n\n- U.S. FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See Item 1 - Business - Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, Federal Regulation.\n- Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations.\n- Regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations, including potential regulation regarding the sourcing, importation and the sale of goods.\n- Environmental protection regulations.\n- U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, sanction programs and trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or film or television content requirements, investment obligations or quotas.\n- Domestic and international labor laws, tax laws or currency controls.\n\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes in any of these current laws and regulations or regulator activities in any of these areas, or others, may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable, and create an increasingly unpredictable regulatory landscape. For example, in 2019 India implemented regulation and tariffs impacting certain bundling of channels; in 2022 the U.S. and other countries implemented a series of sanctions against Russia in response to events in Russia and Ukraine; U.S. agencies have enhanced trade restrictions and legislation is currently under consideration that would prohibit importation of goods from certain regions; U.S. state governments have become more active in passing legislation targeted at specific sectors and companies; and in many countries/regions around the world (including but not limited to the EU) regulators are requiring us to broadcast on our linear (or display on our DTC streaming services) programming produced in specific countries as well as invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content productions.\n\nPublic health and other regional, national, state and local regulations and policies are impacting our ability to operate our businesses at all or in accordance with historic practice. In addition to the government requirements that have impacted most of our businesses as a result of COVID-19, government requirements may continue to be extended and new government requirements may be imposed to address COVID-19 or future health outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n## Our operations outside the U.S. may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.\n\nOur operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than, or in addition to, U.S. law. Our risks of operating internationally have increased following the completion of the TFCF acquisition, which increased the importance of international operations to our future operations, growth and prospects. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S. These differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under U.S. law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some international jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete",

Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n- Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).\n- Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\n\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\n\nThe main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:\n\n- compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&amp;D related to our existing and new products and services;\n- depreciation; and\n- professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.\n\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  engaged  in  sales  and  marketing,  sales  support,  and  certain  customer service functions; and\n- spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\n\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  in  finance,  human  resources,  information  technology,  legal,  and  other administrative support functions;\n- expenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\n- professional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically ex pect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title's launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in 'Other current assets' or 'Other non-current assets' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in 'Content assets, net') and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in 'Cost of revenues') on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are ex pected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases as well as net operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax  assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax  assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings and future tax able income, and prudent and feasible tax  planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future tax able income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe number of entertainment choices available to consumers, including DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, social networking and user-generated content platforms,  and  gaming  and  virtual  reality  products  and  services,  continue  to  increase,  intensify  audience  fragmentation  and  disaggregate  how  content traditionally has been distributed to and viewed by consumers. The continuing trend of content owners, including us with Peacock, delivering their content directly to  consumers,  rather  than  through,  or  in  addition  to,  traditional  video  distribution  channels  also  disrupts  traditional  media  distribution  business  models.  As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming services in lieu of linear video services, which continue to experience accelerated net customer losses, our video customers and video revenues, and linear television network subscriber fees received from video service providers, each decrease. In addition to reducing traditional television viewership, these trends when coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our television networks. Shifting content consumption patterns also may result in lower demand for home entertainment products or theatrical attendance. While we have adapted some of our video and content offerings to compete in the evolving media distribution landscape, such as by offering Peacock and NOW, there also can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete or that Peacock will grow or sustain its revenue or user base, successfully compete as a stand-alone DTC streaming service or fully offset decreases to our linear television networks' results of operations.\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nWe compete for the sale of advertising time with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers as advertisers have shifted, and may continue to shift, a larger portion of their total expenditures to digital media. We also compete with other online content providers, such as social  networking  platforms  and  user-generated  content  providers,  television  networks  and  stations,  and  all  other  advertising  platforms.  Because  we  derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models or on Peacock, could negatively impact our results of operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, declines caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries and economic conditions generally; increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, audience fragmentation and viewing content on DTC streaming services; use of time-shifting or advertising-blocking technologies; and regulatory intervention on advertising placement. Lower audience ratings  and  reduced  viewership,  which  many  of  our  linear  television  networks  have  ex perienced,  and  likely  will  continue  to  ex perience,  as  well  as  the  level  of popularity of Peacock, affect advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us and the rates paid. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\n\nWe create and acquire media, sports and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. To meet the changing preferences of our consumer markets, we must consistently create, acquire, market and distribute a broad array of content and theme park attractions. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in content, such as the production of films and original content for television networks and streaming services, and in the creation of new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance.\n\nWe obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense. Entering into or renewing contracts for such content rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in significantly increased costs, potentially over an extended contractual term. Particularly with respect to contracts for sports rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own DTC services. There can be no assurance that revenue generated from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights and of producing and distributing the programming. In addition, media companies may determine not to license popular content to us, and as more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these contracts on acceptable terms could reduce the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our results of operations and businesses.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically ex pect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title's launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in 'Other current assets' or 'Other non-current assets' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in 'Content assets, net') and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in 'Cost of revenues') on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are ex pected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases as well as net operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax  assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax  assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings and future tax able income, and prudent and feasible tax  planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future tax able income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in  the  United  States,  in  Europe  or  globally  could  adversely  affect  demand  for  any  of  our  products  and  services  and  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks.  In  particular,  the  success  of  our  theme  parks  and  theatrical  releases  largely  depends  on  consumer  demand  for  out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also cause governments and regulators to impose additional tax or product affordability regulations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as high interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\n## Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  make  acquisitions  and  investments  and  may  pursue  other  strategic  initiatives,  such  as  the  proposed  Spin-off.  In  connection  with  such acquisitions  and  strategic  initiatives,  we  may  incur  significant  or  unanticipated  ex penses,  fail  to  realize  anticipated  benefits  and  synergies,  have  difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nincluding through third-party licensees or sellers of our licensed goods and services. In addition, third-party suppliers provide products and services essential to the operation of a number of our businesses. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties or materially impacted a supplier of a significant product or service, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected. In specific geographic markets, we have experienced delayed and/or partial payments from certain third parties due to liquidity issues.\n\nWe obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including certain physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we ex perience losses not covered by our insurance, which could be material.\n\n## We face risks related to changes in our business strategy, which have affected and may continue to affect our cost structure, the profitability of our businesses and/or the value of our assets.\n\nWe adjust our business strategies from time to time in connection with changes in senior management and in our efforts to respond to changes in technology, consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, acceptance of our entertainment offerings, the market for advertising, macroeconomic conditions and other changes in the business environment. For example, in fiscal 2024, we announced entering into a definitive agreement to transfer Star India into a joint venture and related impairment charges; in fiscal 2023, we reorganized our media and entertainment operations, which had been previously reported in one segment, into two segments, Entertainment and Sports; in fiscal 2023 we announced that we would review content, primarily on our DTC services, for alignment with a strategic change in our approach to content curation, resulting in removal of certain content from our platforms and related impairment charges; in fiscal 2022, we announced plans to introduce an ad-supported Disney+ service, new pricing model and price increases and cost realignment; and we have announced exploration of a number of new types of businesses. Changes in strategy, such as was the case with the most recent reorganization of our media and entertainment operations, can lead to workforce disruptions. Our new business strategies are, among other things, subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits, such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value. For example, notwithstanding our continuing efforts to rationalize costs, the cost of executing on our DTC strategy may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which may impact our distribution strategy across businesses/distribution platforms, the types of content we distribute through various businesses/distribution platforms, the timing and sequencing of content windows and ultimately, the profitability of our DTC products and other businesses/distribution platforms. Over the long term, our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies.\n\nIn addition, changing technology, consumer purchasing patterns and acceptance of content offerings and macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. We incur costs in connection with changes to our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to write-down the value of our assets. Among other assets, we have impaired the value of our content primarily at our DTC services and goodwill and intangible assets at our linear networks and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets. We may write down other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the business environment.\n\nWe also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. For example, in fiscal 2024, we announced plans for additional expansion of our fleet of cruise ships, and in recent years to ex pand investment in our Ex periences segment. In addition, in recent years, we have made significant investments in our businesses, such as expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks, additional cruise ships, the acquisition of TFCF Corporation (TFCF) and investments related to DTC offerings. The ultimate success of these investments is uncertain, some of these and future investments may ultimately result in returns that are negative or lower than anticipated, and these investments may impact the resources available to, and the profitability of, our other businesses. In addition, our costs increase in connection with these investments, such as additional ex penses incurred with the launch on new cruise ships, and we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets if the investments are not as successful as anticipated, as occurred in connection with the closure of Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser. Even if our strategies are effective in the long term, our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term, results of our new offerings are unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not ex pand into new markets as or when anticipated. Our ability to forecast for new businesses is impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses, speed with which the competitive landscape changes, volatility beyond our control (such as the events beyond our control noted above) and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based. Accordingly, we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes.",

T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nFluctuations in our  Google  Cloud rev enues hav e been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of rev enues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and  marketing,  and  general  and  administrativ e  functions.  Certain  of  our  costs  and  expenses,  including  those  associated  with  the  operation  of  our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues primarily includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n- employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content rev iew and customer and product support;\n- inv entory and other costs related to the dev ices we sell; and\n- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\n\nTAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the adv ertiser rev enues from ads serv ed on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses",

      "question": "How do Google (GOOGL), AT&T (T), and Verizon (VZ) compare in their 2024 finance lease cost structures, particularly in terms of amortization of lease assets and interest on lease liabilities, and what might this reveal about their respective capital efficiency and leasing strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Google reported a finance lease cost of $444 million, composed of $413 million in amortization of lease assets and $31 million in interest on lease liabilities. AT&T had a total finance lease cost of $376 million, with $205 million attributed to amortization and $171 million to interest. Verizon\u2019s finance lease cost was $427 million, including $329 million in amortization and $98 million in interest. These figures suggest that while all three companies utilize leasing, they differ in the balance between asset amortization and interest burden, potentially reflecting different leasing strategies and capital structures.",

GOOGL disclosed that it determines realized gains or losses on debt securities using the specific identification method, with these gains or losses included as a component of operating income and expenses (OI&E). T reported realized gains of $159 million from real estate and real assets in 2024.

      "answer": "CMCSA highlights declining advertising revenue due to audience fragmentation, reduced traditional television viewership, and advertiser shifts toward digital platforms like DTC streaming services. GOOGL notes that problematic content, web spam, and regulatory uncertainty (such as net neutrality repeal) threaten user trust and advertiser confidence on its platforms. NFLX acknowledges limited experience in monetizing ads, citing risks around member engagement, measurement accuracy, and regulatory constraints on data use as key challenges to growing its ad-supported revenue. Together, these perspectives illustrate a sector-wide struggle to retain advertising dollars amid shifting consumer behavior, platform competition, and evolving regulatory environments.",

      "answer": "Disney notes that privacy and data protection laws, such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the UK's Age Appropriate Design Code, impact the design of their digital offerings and the advertising on their platforms, requiring significant compliance investments and posing risks of substantial fines. Google highlights that increased regulation around data privacy, AI, and online content could limit business models, increase compliance costs, and reduce the effectiveness of their advertising platforms. Meta states that their advertising revenue is vulnerable to technical infrastructure disruptions, user engagement volatility, and increasing expenses tied to privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance, with Reality Labs investments alone reducing 2023 operating profit by $16.12 billion.",

      "question": "How do DIS, META, and T each quantify their increases in unrecognized tax benefits related to current year tax positions in 2024, and what does this reveal about their relative aggressiveness in taking new tax positions?",
      "answer": "In 2024, DIS reported an $82 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to current year tax positions, META reported a significantly higher increase of $2,882 million, and T reported a $369 million increase. This indicates that META was the most aggressive in taking new tax positions among the three companies, with a nearly 35x increase over DIS and over 7x that of T. DIS appears the most conservative in this regard, while T shows a moderate approach. The wide disparity in the scale of current year tax position increases suggests differing risk appetites or strategic tax planning approaches across these communication services firms.",

      "answer": "DIS reports a total finance lease cost of $49 million in 2024, composed of $36 million in amortization and $13 million in interest, indicating a relatively modest reliance on finance leases. META's finance lease cost is significantly higher at $410 million, with $387 million in amortization and $23 million in interest, reflecting a much greater dependency on finance leases, likely tied to its infrastructure expansion. T's total finance lease cost is $376 million, made up of $205 million in amortization and $171 million in interest, suggesting a balanced approach between financing and operational leasing. The differences highlight varying capital strategies, with META leaning heavily on finance leases for asset control, T maintaining a mixed approach, and DIS favoring operating leases with limited finance lease exposure.",

      "answer": "CMCSA includes debt issuance costs in its effective interest rate calculation, reflecting a comprehensive approach to interest expense that incorporates amortization and fair value adjustments. NFLX reports that interest expense includes amortization of debt issuance costs and refers to Note 6 for further detail, suggesting a standard but transparent treatment aligned with typical corporate debt disclosures. VZ excludes unamortized debt issuance costs when reporting long-term debt maturities, indicating a preference to present debt principal amounts net of these costs, which may affect how investors perceive near-term liquidity and interest burden. Together, these approaches show varying degrees of integration and transparency regarding debt issuance costs in financial reporting and interest expense recognition.",

META, on the other hand, recorded a foreign deferred tax benefit of $15 million, showing a slight positive impact. T experienced a small foreign deferred tax expense of $28 million.

      "answer": "Disney reported $0.1 billion in severance charges in fiscal 2024 (which overlaps with calendar 2023), reflecting a relatively modest workforce adjustment. Alphabet disclosed severance charges accounted for as one-time involuntary employee termination benefits, with the majority included in Alphabet-level activities, though specific dollar amounts were not detailed in the excerpt. Verizon recorded $533 million in net pre-tax severance charges in 2023, primarily tied to involuntary separations under existing plans. These figures suggest that while Disney made smaller-scale adjustments, Alphabet managed restructuring at a corporate level, and Verizon undertook a more significant workforce reduction, potentially signaling differing strategic cost containment efforts across the companies.",

      "question": "How do Disney, Meta, and Netflix each assess the impact of shifting content distribution models on their revenue diversification strategies, particularly in light of Disney's declining traditional affiliate and advertising revenue, Meta's reduced ad targeting capabilities, and Netflix's entry into ad-supported streaming?",
      "answer": "Disney notes that declines in traditional forms of content distribution, such as broadcast and cable television, have decreased advertising and affiliate revenue, impairing asset values and negatively impacting the profitability of its DTC offerings. Meta acknowledges that changes to user data practices, such as the Off-Facebook Activity tool, reduce its ability to effectively target ads, adversely affecting its advertising business. Netflix highlights the risks associated with its new ad-supported subscription plan, including the uncertainty of advertiser adoption, member engagement, and the impact of macroeconomic conditions on advertising spend. Together, these perspectives reveal a sector-wide challenge in adapting to evolving content distribution models while maintaining and diversifying revenue streams.",

      "answer": "CMCSA disclosed that $2.0 billion of its gross unrecognized tax benefits would impact its effective tax rate if recognized, with the remainder increasing deferred income tax liability.

      "answer": "In the most recent reporting period, GOOGL reported a total finance lease cost of $444 million, composed of $413 million in amortization of lease assets and $31 million in interest on lease liabilities. META had a total finance lease cost of $410 million, with $387 million attributed to amortization of right-of-use assets and $23 million to interest. T reported the lowest total finance lease cost at $376 million, with $205 million in amortization and $171 million in interest. These differences suggest varying reliance on finance leases and differing strategies in managing lease-related capital expenditures.",

AT&T reports regulatory fees, particularly Universal Service Fund (USF) fees, on a net basis within its revenue recognition policy.

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## NOTE 5. REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nWe report our revenues net of sales taxes and record certain regulatory fees, primarily Universal Service Fund (USF) fees, on a net basis. No customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues in 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n\nWireless, Advanced Data, Legacy Voice &amp; Data Services and Equipment Revenue\n\nWe offer service-only contracts and contracts that bundle equipment used to access the services and/or with other service offerings. Some contracts have fixed terms and others are cancelable on a short-term basis (i.e., month-to-month arrangements).\n\nExamples of service revenues include wireless, fiber and other advanced connectivity, transitional and legacy voice and data. These services represent a series of distinct services that is considered a separate performance obligation. Service revenue is recognized when services are provided, based upon either period of time (e.g., monthly service fees) or usage (e.g., bytes of data processed).\n\nSome of our services require customer premises equipment that, when combined and integrated with AT&amp;T's specific network infrastructure, facilitates the delivery of service to the customer. In evaluating whether the equipment is a separate performance obligation, we consider the customer's ability to benefit from the equipment on its own or together with other readily available resources and if so, whether the service and equipment are separately identifiable (i.e., is the service highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with the equipment). When equipment is a separate performance obligation, we record the sale of equipment when title has passed and the products are accepted by the customer. For devices sold through indirect channels (e.g., national retailers), revenue is recognized when the retailer accepts the device, not upon activation.\n\nOur equipment and service revenues are predominantly recognized on a gross basis, as most of our services do not involve a third party and we typically control the equipment that is sold to our customers.\n\nRevenue recognized from fixed-term contracts that bundle services and/or equipment is allocated based on the standalone selling price of all required performance obligations of the contract (i.e., each item included in the bundle). Promotional discounts are attributed to each required component of the arrangement, resulting in recognition over the contract term. Standalone selling prices are determined by assessing prices paid for service-only contracts (e.g., arrangements where customers bring their own devices) and standalone device pricing.\n\nWe offer the majority of our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a specified period of time, and, in many cases, they may be eligible to trade in the original equipment for a new device and have the remaining unpaid balance paid or settled. For customers that elect these equipment installment payment programs, at the point of sale, we recognize revenue for the entire amount of revenue allocated to the customer receivable net of fair value of the trade-in right guarantee, when applicable. The difference between the revenue recognized and the consideration received is recorded as a note receivable when the devices are not discounted and our right to consideration is unconditional. When installment sales include promotional discounts that are earned by customers over the contract term (e.g., 'buy one get one free' or equipment discounts with trade-in of a device), notes receivable are recognized net of discounts and the difference between revenue recognized and consideration received is recorded as a contract asset to be amortized over the contract term.\n\nLess commonly, we offer certain customers highly discounted devices when they enter into a minimum service agreement term. For these contracts, we recognize equipment revenue at the point of sale based on a standalone selling price allocation. The difference between the revenue recognized and the cash received is recorded as a contract asset that will amortize over the contract term.\n\nOur contracts allow for customers to frequently modify their arrangement, without incurring penalties in many cases. When a contract is modified, we evaluate the change in scope or price of the contract to determine if the modification should be treated as a new contract or if it should be considered a change of the existing contract. We generally do not have significant impacts from contract modifications.\n\nRevenues from transactions between us and our customers are recorded net of revenue-based regulatory fees and taxes. Cash incentives given to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Nonrefundable, upfront service activation and setup fees associated with service arrangements are deferred and recognized over the associated service contract period or customer relationship life.",

Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Commitments\n\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nIn  the  normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our serv ices and products and corporate activ ities, we indemnify certain parties, including adv ertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and serv ice prov iders with respect to certain matters. We hav e agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Sev eral of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we hav e entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances inv olv ed in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we hav e made under such agreements hav e not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. Howev er, to the extent that v alid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not hav e any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.\n\n## Legal Matters\n\nWe record  a  liability  when  we  believ e  that  it  is  probable  that  a  loss  has  been  incurred,  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  If  we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We ev aluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been prev iously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\n\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculativ e, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial changes to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either indiv idually or in aggregate, hav e a material adv erse effect.\n\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Antitrust Matters\n\nWe are subject to formal and informal inquiries and inv estigations as well as litigation on v arious competition matters by regulatory authorities and priv ate parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the following:\n\n- Shopping: I n  J une  2017,  the  EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its display and ranking of shopping search  results  and  ads  infringed  European  antitrust  laws  and  imposed  a  \u20ac2.4  billion  fine.  We  appealed  the  EC  decision  and  implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into",

          "chunk_text": "\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV  series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n## Non-Income Taxes\n\nThe Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nSimilar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect to these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $400 million, which is expected to increase over time.",

We believe that our simplified go-to-market strategy for 5G in underpenetrated markets will continue to contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth and that expansion of our fiber footprint and our multi-gig offerings will drive greater demand for broadband services on our fast-growing fiber network, as well as increasing our converged customers that have both wireless and fiber.\n\nAs we expand our fiber reach, we will be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity to offset continuing declines in legacy Business Wireline products by growing connectivity with small to mid-sized businesses. We plan to use our strong fiber and wireless assets, broad distribution and integrated product offerings to strengthen our overall market position. We will continue to rationalize our product portfolio with a longer-term shift of the business to fiber and mobile connectivity, and growth in value-added services. As customers are demanding faster and more reliable services, we are decommissioning our legacy copper network and enhancing our offerings to include services that provide better experiences over new technologies, such as AT&amp;T Internet Air.\n\n2025 Expense Trends During 2025, we expect expense trends consistent with the prior year, and that we will continue to focus on efficiency, led by our cost transformation initiative. We expect the spending required to support growth and efficiency initiatives, primarily our continued deployment of fiber and 5G, to pressure expense trends in 2025. These investments will help prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services, including video streaming, augmented reality, 'smart' technologies, user generated content and artificial intelligence (AI). The software benefits of our 5G wireless technology should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years. Furthermore, to the extent customers upgrade their handsets in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\n\nWe continue to transform our operations to be more efficient and effective. We are restructuring businesses, working with regulators and customers to sunset legacy networks, improving customer service and ordering functions through digital transformation, sizing our support costs and staffing with current activity levels, and reassessing overall benefit costs. We also expect cost savings through AI-driven efficiencies in our network design and operations, software development, sales, marketing, customer support services and general and administrative costs.\n\nMarket Conditions In recent years, uncertainty surrounding global growth rates, inflation and an increasing interest rate environment continued to produce volatility in the credit, currency and equity markets. We expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2025 as we respond to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and our competitive marketplace, especially in wireless services.\n\nIncluded on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits. Our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). We expect only minimal ERISA contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2025. Investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy, and a weakness in the equity, fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans. In addition, our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions; however, these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in 'Other income (expense) - net.' Changes in our discount rate, which are tied to changes in the bond market, and changes in the performance of equity markets, may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2025 (see 'Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates').\n\nExpected Growth Areas Over the next few years, we expect our growth to come from wireless and IP-based fiber broadband services. We provide integrated services to diverse groups of customers in the U.S. on a converged telecommunications network utilizing different technological platforms. In 2025, our key initiatives include:\n\n- Continuing our wireless subscriber momentum and 5G deployment, with expansion of wireless subscribers in underpenetrated markets and converged customers.\n- Continuing our fiber deployment, improving fiber penetration, growing AT&amp;T Internet Air services, accelerating subscriber growth and increasing broadband revenues.\n- Deploying Open RAN to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers, fostering lower network costs, improved operational efficiencies and allowing for continued investment in our fast-growing broadband network.\n- Continuing to drive efficiencies and a competitive advantage through cost transformation initiatives and product simplification.",

      "question": "How do DIS, GOOGL, and META differ in the composition and trend of their finance lease costs, and what does this reveal about their capital structure and asset financing strategies in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2024, DIS reported a finance lease cost of $49 million, composed of $36 million in amortization and $13 million in interest, showing a declining trend from 2023. GOOGL's finance lease cost was significantly higher at $444 million, with $413 million attributed to amortization and $31 million to interest, indicating a decrease from 2023 and a strong reliance on financed assets. META reported a finance lease cost of $410 million, with $387 million in amortization and $23 million in interest, showing an increase from 2023 and a growing use of finance leases. These differences suggest that while DIS maintains a relatively low reliance on finance leases, both GOOGL and META are more capital-intensive in their operations and asset financing strategies.",

      "answer": "CMCSA identifies rising programming expenses as the largest single expense item for its Cable Communications segment, citing increasing demands from local broadcast stations and the risk of higher costs due to media industry consolidation. DIS notes that the cost of acquiring programming rights, especially sports programming, has increased and may continue to rise, impacting profitability depending on advertising markets, subscription levels, and audience size. T reports increased content costs associated with plans bundling HBO Max, which contributed to higher operations and support expenses. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face rising content costs, they experience and manage these pressures differently\u2014CMCSA through retransmission consent and programming contracts, DIS through rights acquisition and regulatory constraints, and T through DTC bundling strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers,  and  shifting  business  models  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  competitive  position,  businesses  and  results  of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nCable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, websites and search engines, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. We  derive  substantial  revenue  from  the  sale  of  advertising,  and  a  decline  in  expenditures  by  advertisers,  including  through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media  and  video  games,  audience  fragmentation,  increased  viewing  of  content  through  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service providers,  regulatory  intervention  regarding  where  and  when  advertising  may  be  placed,  or  economic  conditions  generally.  In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or  from  the  level  of  popularity  or  perceived  acceptance  of  Peacock.  Advertising  sales  and  rates  also  are  dependent  on  the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications' video businesses.\n\nWe  expect  programming  expenses  for  our  video  services  to  continue  to  be  the  largest  single  expense  item  for  our  Cable Communications  segment  and  to  continue  to  increase  on  a  per  subscriber  basis.  Part  of  Cable  Communications'  programming expenses  include  payments  to  certain  local  broadcast  television  stations  in  exchange  for  their  required  consent  for  the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers' rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment's results of operations.\n\nMoreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or  at  all,  in  which  case  we  may  be  unable  to  provide  such  content  as  part  of  Cable  Communications'  video  services,  and  our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## NBCUniversal's and Sky's success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  create  and  acquire  media  and  entertainment  content,  the  success  of  which  depends  substantially  on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for NBCUniversal, including Peacock, and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  also  obtain  a  significant  portion  of  their  content  from  third  parties,  such  as  movie  studios,  television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors  for  popular  content.  We  also  may  be  unable  to  license  popular  third-party  content  for  NBCUniversal's  and  Sky's television  programming  channels  if  media  companies  determine  that  licensing  the  content  to  us  is  not  in  their  strategic  best interests. For example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.\n\nEntering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result  in  significantly  increased  costs.  Particularly  with  respect  to  long-term  contracts  for  sports  programming  rights  for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors,",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. As a result, our portfolio of programming rights and the distributors of our programming have changed and may continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, have demanded and may continue to demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution, the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms and the impacts of COVID-19. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. There can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.\n\n## Changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.\n\nOur broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of U.S. and overseas regulations. Some of these regulations include:\n\n- U.S. FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See Item 1 - Business - Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, Federal Regulation.\n- Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations.\n- Regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations, including potential regulation regarding the sourcing, importation and the sale of goods.\n- Environmental protection regulations.\n- U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, sanction programs and trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or film or television content requirements, investment obligations or quotas.\n- Domestic and international labor laws, tax laws or currency controls.\n\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes in any of these current laws and regulations or regulator activities in any of these areas, or others, may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable, and create an increasingly unpredictable regulatory landscape. For example, in 2019 India implemented regulation and tariffs impacting certain bundling of channels; in 2022 the U.S. and other countries implemented a series of sanctions against Russia in response to events in Russia and Ukraine; U.S. agencies have enhanced trade restrictions and legislation is currently under consideration that would prohibit importation of goods from certain regions; U.S. state governments have become more active in passing legislation targeted at specific sectors and companies; and in many countries/regions around the world (including but not limited to the EU) regulators are requiring us to broadcast on our linear (or display on our DTC streaming services) programming produced in specific countries as well as invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content productions.\n\nPublic health and other regional, national, state and local regulations and policies are impacting our ability to operate our businesses at all or in accordance with historic practice. In addition to the government requirements that have impacted most of our businesses as a result of COVID-19, government requirements may continue to be extended and new government requirements may be imposed to address COVID-19 or future health outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n## Our operations outside the U.S. may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.\n\nOur operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than, or in addition to, U.S. law. Our risks of operating internationally have increased following the completion of the TFCF acquisition, which increased the importance of international operations to our future operations, growth and prospects. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S. These differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under U.S. law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some international jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete",

      "answer": "CMCSA reports that its consolidated interest expense increased in 2023 due to higher average debt and interest rates, but this was partially offset by increased capitalized interest. AT&T discloses specific capitalized interest amounts of $874 million in 2023, down from $1,294 million in 2022, indicating a reduction in qualifying capital projects. Verizon capitalized $1,818 million in interest costs in 2023, a decrease from $2,030 million in 2022, suggesting a similar moderation in capital investment. The differences in capitalized interest amounts and trends reflect varying approaches to financing large-scale infrastructure and managing interest costs.",

      "answer": "META reports that its operating lease obligations mostly include data centers, offices, and colocations, and these obligations were not materially affected by its facilities consolidation. NFLX quantifies its operating lease obligations at $2.76 billion, with $514.6 million due in the next 12 months and $2.25 billion beyond that. VZ discloses operating lease obligations of $29.1 billion, with $5.0 billion due within the next twelve months, along with additional commitments under leaseback and sublease arrangements for cell towers. These figures suggest that VZ maintains significantly larger lease commitments, likely tied to its infrastructure-heavy telecom operations, while NFLX and META manage more moderate lease exposure, with META focusing on infrastructure and AI investments.",

We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.\n\n## Leases and Contractual Commitments\n\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include data centers, offices and colocations. Our finance lease obligations include certain network infrastructure. Our facilities  consolidation  restructuring  efforts  did  not  materially  change  our  operating  lease  obligations.  Our  contractual  commitments  are  primarily  related  to  our investments in servers and network infrastructure, and content costs from content providers whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion, which mature  from  2027  through  2064.  Short-term  and  long-term  future  interest  payments  obligations  as  of  December  31,  2024  were  $1.39  billion  and  $28.10  billion, respectively.\n\n## Capital Return Program\n\n## Share Repurchase\n\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 65 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $29.75 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $51.28 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.\n\n## Dividend\n\nWe paid four quarterly cash dividends, including dividend equivalents, totaling $2.00 for each share of Class A and Class B common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. Total dividends and dividend equivalents paid were $5.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. Subject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend and dividend equivalents on our outstanding common stock.\n\n## Taxes\n\nCash paid for income taxes was $10.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had taxes payable of $718 million related to a one-time transition tax  payable incurred as a result of the Tax  Act, which is due within one year.\n\nOur long-term income taxes include $9.99 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.",

In addition, V erizon has an obligation of $3.7 billion representing future minimum payments under the leaseback and sublease arrangements for our cell towers, of which $447 million is expected to be due within the next twelve months. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n- Unconditional purchase obligations, with terms in excess of one year, amount to $16.7 billion, of which $6.2 billion is expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in unconditional purchase obligations are primarily commitments to purchase content, network equipment, software and services, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n- Other long-term liabilities, including current maturities, of $3.9 billion, of which approximately $726 million is expected to be due within the next twelve months.  Other  long-term  liabilities  represent  estimated  postretirement  benefit  and  qualified  pension  plan  contributions.  Qualified  pension  plan contributions include estimated minimum funding contributions. We expect that there will be no required pension funding through the end of 2025, subject to changes in market conditions. Postretirement benefit payments include future postretirement benefit payments. These estimated amounts: (1) are  subject  to  change  based  on  changes  to  assumptions  and  future  plan  performance,  which  could  impact  the  timing  and/or  amounts  of  these payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts.\n- We are not able to make a reasonable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $2.6 billion and related interest and penalties will be settled with the respective taxing authorities until the related tax audits are further developed or resolved.\n\n## Consolidated Financial Condition\n\n",

Meta experienced the most dramatic growth, with domestic revenue rising from $43,499 million in 2023 to $66,342 million in 2024, a 52% increase.

      "answer": "CMCSA notes that weak economic conditions negatively impact advertising revenue due to reduced discretionary spending and the availability of free or lower-cost alternatives. GOOGL highlights that over 75% of its total revenues come from online advertising, making it highly exposed to risks such as changes in advertiser spending, regulatory scrutiny, and technologies that block online ads. META specifically identifies regulatory developments like GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive, and iOS changes as key factors that have reduced its ability to target and measure ads effectively, directly harming its advertising revenue. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, GOOGL and META face unique regulatory and platform-specific challenges that disproportionately affect their digital advertising models.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in  the  United  States,  in  Europe  or  globally  could  adversely  affect  demand  for  any  of  our  products  and  services  and  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks.  In  particular,  the  success  of  our  theme  parks  and  theatrical  releases  largely  depends  on  consumer  demand  for  out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also cause governments and regulators to impose additional tax or product affordability regulations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as high interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\n## Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  make  acquisitions  and  investments  and  may  pursue  other  strategic  initiatives,  such  as  the  proposed  Spin-off.  In  connection  with  such acquisitions  and  strategic  initiatives,  we  may  incur  significant  or  unanticipated  ex penses,  fail  to  realize  anticipated  benefits  and  synergies,  have  difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, including the CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Other U.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing additional rights for users and could result in restrictions  on  our  use  of  signals  from  third-party  apps  and  websites  through  certain  browser-  and  device-based  universal  opt-out  mechanisms.  Judicial  and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings.\n\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and G oogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\n\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021.  If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\n\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\n\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to",

      "answer": "In 2024, META reported $387 million in amortization of right-of-use assets and $23 million in interest expenses under finance lease costs, indicating a relatively modest lease-based capital investment. AT&T disclosed $205 million in amortization and $171 million in interest expenses, suggesting a more significant reliance on finance leases, though lower than Verizon. Verizon had the highest amortization at $329 million and interest expenses of $98 million, signaling a more aggressive capital investment strategy through finance leases.

GOOGL has significantly larger state NOLs at $18.6 billion, though the filing does not specify expiration timelines, suggesting a potentially more aggressive or uncertain tax planning environment. NFLX has $838 million in state NOLs set to begin expiring in 2026, which is a much shorter horizon and implies greater urgency in tax strategy execution.

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and VZ each quantify or characterize their exposure to employee benefit obligations, and what does this reveal about their relative financial commitments to workforce-related liabilities?",
      "answer": "CMCSA reports a minor impact of employee benefit obligations within its comprehensive income, showing a net effect of only $3 million in 2023. DIS highlights the sensitivity of its pension and postretirement medical obligations to actuarial assumptions, particularly noting a 5.06% discount rate and a potential $2.4 billion increase in projected benefit obligation from a 1% decrease in the discount rate. VZ discloses a significant liability of $13,189 million for employee benefit obligations as of December 31, 2023, reflecting a substantial balance sheet commitment. Together, these figures indicate that while CMCSA's exposure is minimal in reported financials, DIS actively monitors and discloses risk factors tied to assumptions, and VZ carries a large direct liability, suggesting differing levels of workforce-related financial commitments across the communication services sector.",

      "answer": "CMCSA generates advertising revenue through the sale of scheduled ad time on its owned networks and digital platforms, with most ads aired or delivered within one year of contract finalization. META notes that changes to product features, such as the promotion of Reels, may reduce ad monetization rates compared to more established formats like Feed and Stories, creating financial risk. NFLX mentions advertising in the context of strategic flexibility, particularly through its ad-supported subscription plan, which is part of its broader effort to diversify pricing and attract different consumer segments. Together, these perspectives highlight CMCSA's traditional ad sales model, META's product-driven ad challenges, and NFLX's emerging ad-supported growth strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWhile a portion of our customers are subject to contracts for their services, which are typically 1 month to 2 years in length, based on our evaluation of the terms of these contracts, we recognize revenue for these services primarily on a basis that is consistent with our customers that are not subject to contracts and recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Installation fees for these customers are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of benefit to the  customer,  which  is  less  than  a  year.  Certain  international  customers  are  under  contracts,  with  terms  typically  ranging  from  rolling  monthly  to  24  months, depending on the service, and may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We recognize revenue for these customers as the services are provided over the contract period. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned from these customers related to existing agreements is equal  to  less  than 10%  of  our  annual  Residential  Connectivity  &amp;  Platforms  revenue  and  will  generally  be  recognized  within 24  months.  Sales  commissions  are generally expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a year. Sales commissions for the international customers under contract are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\nOur services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as wireless gateways and set-top boxes, that are generally considered part of our services for revenue recognition. We recognize revenue from the sale of devices, including wireless devices and Sky G lass smart televisions, when they are transferred to the customer. Under an equipment installment plan, customers typically have the option to finance wireless devices and Sky G lass smart televisions interest-free over 24 months, and up to 48 months for international customers. Equipment installment plan receivables under these arrangements are recorded net of imputed interest when the devices are transferred to the customer.\n\nWe also have arrangements to sell certain DTC streaming services to our customers. We have concluded we are the sales agent in these arrangements, and we record net commission revenue as earned, which is generally as customers are billed on a monthly basis, within domestic broadband and international connectivity revenue.\n\nUnder the terms of our domestic cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay the cable franchising authority an amount based on gross video revenue. We generally pass these and other similar fees through to our domestic customers and classify these fees in the respective Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms services revenue, with the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses.\n\n## Advertising\n\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising and technology, tools and solutions relating to advertising businesses. As part of distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to advertisers. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our owned Sky-branded entertainment television networks and our digital platforms. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to the third parties in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions.\n\nWe have determined that a contract exists for our advertising sales arrangements once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or delivered within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally  require  payment  within 30  to 60  days  from  when  advertisements  are  aired  or  delivered.  We  also  provide  technology,  tools,  data-driven  services  and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate the more effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences and recognize revenue when these services are provided.\n\n## Business Services Connectivity Segment\n\nBusiness Services Connectivity generates revenue from subscribers to a variety of our products and services which are offered to businesses. Our connectivity service offerings for small business locations in the United States primarily include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services that are similar to those provided to our residential customers and include certain other features specific to businesses. Our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises also include ethernet network services, advanced voice services and a software-defined networking product. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

We aim to offer a range of pricing plans, including our ad-supported subscription plan, to meet a variety of consumer needs. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers' leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\n\n## SEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, META, and AT&T (T) each manage their cash used in financing activities in 2023, and what does this reveal about their differing capital allocation strategies?",
      "answer": "CMCSA used $19.9 billion in cash for financing activities in 2023, reflecting a consistent pattern of capital return to shareholders and debt management. META used $19.77 billion in cash for financing activities, primarily for stock repurchases and employee-related tax payments, signaling a strong emphasis on shareholder returns and equity compensation. AT&T used $15,614 million (or $15.6 billion) in cash for financing activities, largely driven by debt issuances and repayments, as well as dividend payments, indicating a more balanced approach between maintaining shareholder returns and managing leverage. Collectively, these figures highlight how each company approaches capital structure and shareholder returns differently, with META prioritizing stock buybacks, CMCSA maintaining a stable financing outflow, and AT&T focusing on a mix of debt management and dividends.",

      "answer": "CMCSA reported an increase in interest expense in 2023 due to higher average debt outstanding and interest rates, which was partially offset by increased capitalized interest. This suggests that CMCSA is investing in long-term assets while managing rising financing costs. DIS capitalizes interest as part of its film and television content production costs, indicating that it treats content development as a long-term investment and aligns financing costs with the monetization lifecycle of its intellectual property. VZ capitalized interest costs of $1,818 million in 2023, a decrease from 2022, which may signal a moderation in new capital-intensive investments or a shift in financing structure. Together, these approaches show how each company incorporates capitalized interest into its broader capital deployment and asset management strategy.",

Meanwhile, T referenced goodwill impairments in a broader context of asset charges, specifically noting them in conjunction with an asset abandonment charge. This divergence indicates that DIS experienced significant asset valuation pressures, particularly in its media and entertainment segments, while CMCSA's asset valuations remained stable. T's inclusion of goodwill impairments as part of a broader set of charges suggests a more complex restructuring environment, potentially tied to its transition and network modernization strategies.",

      "answer": "CMCSA reported that content costs, including sports rights and entertainment programming, had a direct negative impact on their Media segment expenses, with Peacock alone accounting for $6.1 billion in 2023. DIS disclosed $549 million in produced and licensed content costs, indicating a significant but more contained investment relative to its overall asset base. NFLX highlighted rising content licensing costs and the increasing difficulty of securing exclusive rights, noting that content providers are becoming more competitive, which pressures their cost structure and content availability. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies are significantly impacted by content costs, they manage these pressures through different strategic lenses \u2014 CMCSA through sports and streaming expansion, DIS through content production and licensing, and NFLX through original content and exclusivity.",

      "answer": "In 2023, DIS used $2.724 billion in cash for financing activities, primarily indicating a conservative financial strategy with limited capital return or debt restructuring. META, on the other hand, used $19.77 billion for stock repurchases and $7.01 billion for taxes on RSUs, signaling a strong focus on returning value to shareholders despite a decrease in repurchase activity compared to the prior year. T used $15,614 million in financing activities, highlighting significant debt management and capital structure adjustments. These differences suggest that DIS maintained a more cautious stance, META prioritized shareholder returns, and T focused on managing its capital structure through vendor financing and debt-related activities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe number of entertainment choices available to consumers, including DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, social networking and user-generated content platforms,  and  gaming  and  virtual  reality  products  and  services,  continue  to  increase,  intensify  audience  fragmentation  and  disaggregate  how  content traditionally has been distributed to and viewed by consumers. The continuing trend of content owners, including us with Peacock, delivering their content directly to  consumers,  rather  than  through,  or  in  addition  to,  traditional  video  distribution  channels  also  disrupts  traditional  media  distribution  business  models.  As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming services in lieu of linear video services, which continue to experience accelerated net customer losses, our video customers and video revenues, and linear television network subscriber fees received from video service providers, each decrease. In addition to reducing traditional television viewership, these trends when coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our television networks. Shifting content consumption patterns also may result in lower demand for home entertainment products or theatrical attendance. While we have adapted some of our video and content offerings to compete in the evolving media distribution landscape, such as by offering Peacock and NOW, there also can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete or that Peacock will grow or sustain its revenue or user base, successfully compete as a stand-alone DTC streaming service or fully offset decreases to our linear television networks' results of operations.\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nWe compete for the sale of advertising time with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers as advertisers have shifted, and may continue to shift, a larger portion of their total expenditures to digital media. We also compete with other online content providers, such as social  networking  platforms  and  user-generated  content  providers,  television  networks  and  stations,  and  all  other  advertising  platforms.  Because  we  derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models or on Peacock, could negatively impact our results of operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, declines caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries and economic conditions generally; increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, audience fragmentation and viewing content on DTC streaming services; use of time-shifting or advertising-blocking technologies; and regulatory intervention on advertising placement. Lower audience ratings  and  reduced  viewership,  which  many  of  our  linear  television  networks  have  ex perienced,  and  likely  will  continue  to  ex perience,  as  well  as  the  level  of popularity of Peacock, affect advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us and the rates paid. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\n\nWe create and acquire media, sports and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. To meet the changing preferences of our consumer markets, we must consistently create, acquire, market and distribute a broad array of content and theme park attractions. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in content, such as the production of films and original content for television networks and streaming services, and in the creation of new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance.\n\nWe obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense. Entering into or renewing contracts for such content rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in significantly increased costs, potentially over an extended contractual term. Particularly with respect to contracts for sports rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own DTC services. There can be no assurance that revenue generated from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights and of producing and distributing the programming. In addition, media companies may determine not to license popular content to us, and as more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these contracts on acceptable terms could reduce the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our results of operations and businesses.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, AT&T (T), and Verizon (VZ) each characterize their Corporate and Other segment's impact on financial performance, and what does this reveal about their corporate overhead management strategies?",
      "answer": "CMCSA describes its Corporate and Other segment as including overhead and personnel costs for Corporate, and notes that this segment includes operations such as Sky-branded video services in Germany, Comcast Spectacor, and Xumo. AT&T (T) reports its Corporate and Other segment with a significant operating loss of $2.89 billion, driven largely by $28.03 billion in 'certain significant items' expenses. Verizon (VZ) shows its Corporate and Other segment as a consistent operating loss of $610 million in 2024, with additional reconciling items like severance charges and asset rationalization contributing to overall financial performance. These differences suggest CMCSA maintains a more diversified corporate segment with operational components, AT&T faces substantial corporate-level costs impacting profitability, and Verizon manages corporate costs more tightly while absorbing strategic restructuring charges.",

The costs of these licenses in Media are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition betw een segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period.\n\n(b) Includes the operations of our S ky-branded video services and television netw orks in G ermany; C omcast S pectacor, w hich ow ns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo C enter arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture w ith Charter Communications.

Our chief operating decision maker uses aggregate expense information to manage the operations of the Theme Parks segment.\n\n(e) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our segments. For each of our segments, our chief operating decision maker uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure operational strength and performance, assist in the evaluation of underlying trends, and allocate resources in the annual budget and forecasting process.

      "answer": "CMCSA highlights that programming expenses are the largest single expense for its Cable Communications segment and are expected to continue rising on a per-subscriber basis, driven by increasing demands from local broadcast stations for retransmission consent and the competitive bidding for popular content. DIS notes that the cost of obtaining programming rights, especially for sports, has increased and may continue to rise, impacting profitability, particularly if advertising markets weaken or subscription levels fall short of expectations. GOOGL discloses that content acquisition costs include payments to providers licensing video and other content for YouTube and Google Play, often based on revenue shares or flat fees, which scale with content consumption and platform growth. Together, these perspectives reveal that CMCSA is vulnerable through its linear video distribution cost structure, DIS through its high-stakes sports rights investments, and GOOGL through its platform-based content licensing obligations\u2014each facing distinct pressures in a fragmented and competitive content ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers,  and  shifting  business  models  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  competitive  position,  businesses  and  results  of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nCable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, websites and search engines, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. We  derive  substantial  revenue  from  the  sale  of  advertising,  and  a  decline  in  expenditures  by  advertisers,  including  through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media  and  video  games,  audience  fragmentation,  increased  viewing  of  content  through  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service providers,  regulatory  intervention  regarding  where  and  when  advertising  may  be  placed,  or  economic  conditions  generally.  In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or  from  the  level  of  popularity  or  perceived  acceptance  of  Peacock.  Advertising  sales  and  rates  also  are  dependent  on  the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications' video businesses.\n\nWe  expect  programming  expenses  for  our  video  services  to  continue  to  be  the  largest  single  expense  item  for  our  Cable Communications  segment  and  to  continue  to  increase  on  a  per  subscriber  basis.  Part  of  Cable  Communications'  programming expenses  include  payments  to  certain  local  broadcast  television  stations  in  exchange  for  their  required  consent  for  the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers' rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment's results of operations.\n\nMoreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or  at  all,  in  which  case  we  may  be  unable  to  provide  such  content  as  part  of  Cable  Communications'  video  services,  and  our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## NBCUniversal's and Sky's success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  create  and  acquire  media  and  entertainment  content,  the  success  of  which  depends  substantially  on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for NBCUniversal, including Peacock, and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  also  obtain  a  significant  portion  of  their  content  from  third  parties,  such  as  movie  studios,  television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors  for  popular  content.  We  also  may  be  unable  to  license  popular  third-party  content  for  NBCUniversal's  and  Sky's television  programming  channels  if  media  companies  determine  that  licensing  the  content  to  us  is  not  in  their  strategic  best interests. For example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.\n\nEntering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result  in  significantly  increased  costs.  Particularly  with  respect  to  long-term  contracts  for  sports  programming  rights  for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors,",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. As a result, our portfolio of programming rights and the distributors of our programming have changed and may continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, have demanded and may continue to demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution, the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms and the impacts of COVID-19. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. There can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.\n\n## Changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.\n\nOur broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of U.S. and overseas regulations. Some of these regulations include:\n\n- U.S. FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See Item 1 - Business - Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, Federal Regulation.\n- Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations.\n- Regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations, including potential regulation regarding the sourcing, importation and the sale of goods.\n- Environmental protection regulations.\n- U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, sanction programs and trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or film or television content requirements, investment obligations or quotas.\n- Domestic and international labor laws, tax laws or currency controls.\n\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes in any of these current laws and regulations or regulator activities in any of these areas, or others, may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable, and create an increasingly unpredictable regulatory landscape. For example, in 2019 India implemented regulation and tariffs impacting certain bundling of channels; in 2022 the U.S. and other countries implemented a series of sanctions against Russia in response to events in Russia and Ukraine; U.S. agencies have enhanced trade restrictions and legislation is currently under consideration that would prohibit importation of goods from certain regions; U.S. state governments have become more active in passing legislation targeted at specific sectors and companies; and in many countries/regions around the world (including but not limited to the EU) regulators are requiring us to broadcast on our linear (or display on our DTC streaming services) programming produced in specific countries as well as invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content productions.\n\nPublic health and other regional, national, state and local regulations and policies are impacting our ability to operate our businesses at all or in accordance with historic practice. In addition to the government requirements that have impacted most of our businesses as a result of COVID-19, government requirements may continue to be extended and new government requirements may be imposed to address COVID-19 or future health outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n## Our operations outside the U.S. may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.\n\nOur operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than, or in addition to, U.S. law. Our risks of operating internationally have increased following the completion of the TFCF acquisition, which increased the importance of international operations to our future operations, growth and prospects. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S. These differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under U.S. law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some international jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete",

Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n- Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).\n- Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\n\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\n\nThe main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:\n\n- compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&amp;D related to our existing and new products and services;\n- depreciation; and\n- professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.\n\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  engaged  in  sales  and  marketing,  sales  support,  and  certain  customer service functions; and\n- spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\n\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  in  finance,  human  resources,  information  technology,  legal,  and  other administrative support functions;\n- expenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\n- professional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.",

T explicitly reports total capitalized interest of $361 million for 2024, showing a declining trend from $1,294 million in 2022, which suggests a reduction in major capital projects or a shift in financing strategy. VZ discloses negative capitalized interest costs of $963 million in 2024, meaning it reduced interest costs through capitalization, compared to deductions of $1,818 million in 2023 and $2,030 million in 2022, indicating a consistent but decreasing benefit from interest capitalization on its capital expenditures.

Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income.\n\nFor local currency functional locations, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and ex penses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI).\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventory primarily includes vacation timeshare units, merchandise, food, materials and supplies. Carrying amounts of vacation ownership units are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Carrying amounts of merchandise, food, materials and supplies inventories are generally determined on a moving average cost basis and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\n\n## Film and Television Content Costs\n\nThe Company classifies its capitalized produced and acquired/licensed content costs as long-term assets ('Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and classifies advances for live programming rights made prior to the live event as short-term assets ('Content advances' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet). For produced content, we capitalize all direct costs incurred in the physical production of a film, as well as allocations of production overhead and capitalized interest. For licensed and acquired content, we capitalize the license fee or acquisition cost, respectively. For purposes of amortization and impairment, the capitalized content costs are classified based on their predominant monetization strategy as follows:\n\n- Individual - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are directly attributable to the specific film or television title (e.g. theatrical revenues or sales to third-party television programmers)\n- Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g. subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network)\n\nThe determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content. Imputed title by title license fees that may be necessary for other purposes are established as required for those purposes.\n\nWe generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC streaming services or Linear Networks as group assets. We generally classify content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees as individual assets. The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title's monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g. content that was initially intended for license to a third party is instead used on an owned DTC service). When there is a significant change in monetization strategy, the title's capitalized content costs are tested for impairment.\n\nProduction costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues). For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films. For episodic series that are classified as individual, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. Participations and residuals are ex pensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.\n\nProduction costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.\n\nLicensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our Linear Networks, domestic ESPN television network, International Sports Channels or DTC streaming services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and NFLX each characterize the impact of licensing fees on their financial strategies, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to content monetization in the evolving streaming landscape?",
      "answer": "CMCSA notes that licensing fees are being negatively impacted as content owners increasingly bypass traditional distribution channels to deliver content directly to consumers, reducing both the quantity and quality of licensed content available to CMCSA and the licensing fees they receive from third parties. DIS highlights that rising licensing fees, among other cost pressures, are affecting their profitability, particularly as they invest in DTC offerings while forgoing revenue from traditional sources. In contrast, NFLX earns revenue primarily through direct-to-consumer subscription fees rather than licensing fees, with only immaterial revenue from third-party licensing arrangements. This reveals that CMCSA and DIS are grappling with the financial pressures of a shifting licensing environment, while NFLX has largely sidestepped this dynamic by building a vertically integrated, direct monetization model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Licensing Fees: CMCSA states that content owners are increasingly delivering content directly to consumers, which reduces both the amount and quality of content licensed to CMCSA and the licensing fees they receive from third parties.",
        "Hop 2: DIS \u2192 Licensing Fees: DIS notes that as part of its DTC strategy, it forgoes revenue from traditional sources, including licensing fees, while facing cost pressures that negatively impact the profitability of its DTC offerings.",
        "Hop 3: NFLX \u2192 Licensing Fees: NFLX earns the vast majority of its revenue from direct monthly membership fees, with licensing fees and other revenue sources (e.g., advertisements, consumer products) being immaterial in comparison."

      "answer": "CMCSA reports Property and Equipment, net at $62,548 million in 2024, indicating a large fixed asset base consistent with its infrastructure-heavy cable and telecommunications business. GOOGL discloses Property and Equipment, net as a deferred tax liability of $9,932 million in 2024, reflecting its growing investment in physical assets like data centers and offices, though proportionally less capital-intensive than CMCSA. NFLX shows Property and Equipment, net at $1,593,756 thousand in 2024, with detailed breakdowns of IT infrastructure and short-lived assets, suggesting a focus on scalable, technology-driven capital deployment. Together, these figures highlight differing capital structures: CMCSA is the most asset-intensive, GOOGL balances digital and physical investments, and NFLX emphasizes flexible, shorter-life assets aligned with streaming scalability.",

      "question": "How do Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Verizon (VZ) compare in their weighted average remaining lease terms for finance leases, and what might this reveal about their respective capital structure strategies and long-term asset commitments in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Google reported a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years for finance leases, Meta reported 13.7 years, and Verizon reported only 3 years. This indicates that Meta has the longest-term finance lease obligations among the three, suggesting a more long-term asset commitment and potentially more stable, fixed-cost financing. In contrast, Verizon\u2019s much shorter lease term implies either a more flexible leasing strategy or a more recent refresh of leased assets. Google falls in between, with a moderate lease duration that suggests a balanced approach to financing long-term assets while allowing for some flexibility.",

NFLX had a provision for income taxes of $1,254,026 thousand in 2024, with a consistent effective tax rate of 13%, driven by benefits from foreign-derived intangible income deductions and stock-based compensation tax advantages. VZ included a provision for income taxes of $5,030 million in 2024 as part of its consolidated net income adjustments, indicating a more stable tax expense relative to its large-scale operations.

      "answer": "CMCSA highlights that programming expenses are its largest single expense and are expected to increase on a per-subscriber basis, particularly due to rising demands from local broadcast stations for retransmission consent and higher costs for sports programming rights. GOOGL incurs content acquisition costs as part of its cost of revenues, paying fees to content providers for licensing video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play, either based on revenue share or flat fees. T notes an increase in content costs associated with plans bundling HBO Max, which contributed to higher operations and support expenses. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are impacted by content costs, CMCSA is most directly constrained by rising licensing fees, GOOGL strategically invests in licensed content to support its platforms, and T integrates content costs into bundled service offerings, reflecting different strategic dependencies on content in their respective business models.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers,  and  shifting  business  models  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  competitive  position,  businesses  and  results  of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nCable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, websites and search engines, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. We  derive  substantial  revenue  from  the  sale  of  advertising,  and  a  decline  in  expenditures  by  advertisers,  including  through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media  and  video  games,  audience  fragmentation,  increased  viewing  of  content  through  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service providers,  regulatory  intervention  regarding  where  and  when  advertising  may  be  placed,  or  economic  conditions  generally.  In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or  from  the  level  of  popularity  or  perceived  acceptance  of  Peacock.  Advertising  sales  and  rates  also  are  dependent  on  the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications' video businesses.\n\nWe  expect  programming  expenses  for  our  video  services  to  continue  to  be  the  largest  single  expense  item  for  our  Cable Communications  segment  and  to  continue  to  increase  on  a  per  subscriber  basis.  Part  of  Cable  Communications'  programming expenses  include  payments  to  certain  local  broadcast  television  stations  in  exchange  for  their  required  consent  for  the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers' rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment's results of operations.\n\nMoreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or  at  all,  in  which  case  we  may  be  unable  to  provide  such  content  as  part  of  Cable  Communications'  video  services,  and  our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## NBCUniversal's and Sky's success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  create  and  acquire  media  and  entertainment  content,  the  success  of  which  depends  substantially  on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for NBCUniversal, including Peacock, and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  also  obtain  a  significant  portion  of  their  content  from  third  parties,  such  as  movie  studios,  television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors  for  popular  content.  We  also  may  be  unable  to  license  popular  third-party  content  for  NBCUniversal's  and  Sky's television  programming  channels  if  media  companies  determine  that  licensing  the  content  to  us  is  not  in  their  strategic  best interests. For example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.\n\nEntering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result  in  significantly  increased  costs.  Particularly  with  respect  to  long-term  contracts  for  sports  programming  rights  for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors,",

Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n- Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).\n- Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\n\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\n\nThe main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:\n\n- compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&amp;D related to our existing and new products and services;\n- depreciation; and\n- professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.\n\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  engaged  in  sales  and  marketing,  sales  support,  and  certain  customer service functions; and\n- spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\n\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\n- compensation  expenses  for  employees  in  finance,  human  resources,  information  technology,  legal,  and  other administrative support functions;\n- expenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\n- professional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.",

Google explains that its Chief Operating Decision Maker uses segment operating income to allocate resources during annual planning and assesses segment performance against annual plans, but excludes certain AI R&D costs and corporate activities from segment reporting. Verizon emphasizes using segment operating income to guide monthly and quarterly decisions on network investments, capital expenditures, and geographic expansion, treating it as central to both performance evaluation and strategic resource allocation. Together, these approaches show that while all three companies report segment operating income, they apply it differently in strategic decision-making\u2014with Disney focusing on performance transparency, Google on internal resource prioritization, and Verizon on operational execution.",

T ax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2009 in certain states and as early as 2000 outside the U.S.\n\n## Note 13. Segment Information\n\n## Reportable Segments\n\nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker's (CODM ) assessment of segment performance.\n\nThe Company's CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM  uses segment operating income to allocate resources (including employees, financial or capital resources) and to assess performance during the monthly and quarterly financial strategic review process. When assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources, the CODM  focuses on evaluating whether revenues generated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate return on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM  using segment operating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network technologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's priorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks, establishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions, branding matters and people management.\n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:",

      "question": "How do DIS, T, and VZ each report changes in their respective 'Balance at Beginning of Period' for credit-related allowances in 2023, and what do these changes suggest about their financial exposure and provisioning strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2023, DIS reported a beginning balance of $2.9 billion in its tax-related allowance, which increased to $3.2 billion by year-end due to net additions. T reported a beginning balance of $1,011 million in its allowance for credit losses, which declined to $756 million by year-end due to deductions. VZ started with a beginning balance of $1,261 million in its credit loss allowance and increased it to $1,609 million after significant additions during the year. These differences suggest varied approaches to credit risk provisioning, with VZ showing the most aggressive additions, T reducing its effective allowance, and DIS maintaining a relatively stable position.",

      "question": "How do Google (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Verizon (VZ) each reflect the impact of tax provisions on their financial performance in 2023, and what does this reveal about their respective tax strategies and net income outcomes?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Google reported a provision for income taxes of $11,922 million, which reflects a relatively stable tax expense compared to previous years. Netflix had a significantly lower effective tax rate of 13% with a provision of $797.4 million, indicating strategic utilization of deductions and credits. Verizon's provision for income taxes was $4,892 million, which, when compared to its consolidated net income of $12,095 million, shows a more traditional tax burden. These differences highlight varied approaches to tax planning, with Netflix leveraging international operations and credits more effectively than Google and Verizon.",

The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations, channels, or digital platforms. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, online media and other digital sources. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur television and streaming platforms compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other cable, broadcast and premium networks, DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, and local broadcast television stations. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost is significant.\n\nOur  cable  networks  compete  with  other  cable  networks  and  programming  providers  for  carriage  of  their  programming  by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. Our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences for our film and television content with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position  of  our  film  and  television  studios  primarily  depends  on  the  number  of  films  and  shows  and  episodes  produced,  their distribution  and  marketing  success,  and  consumer  response.  Our  film  and  television  studios  also  compete  to  obtain  creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on premium networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nTheme Parks competes with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and  recreational  activities.  To  help  maintain  the  competitiveness  of  our  theme  parks,  we  have  invested  and  continue  to  invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including the new theme parks in Beijing and Orlando.\n\n## Sky Segment\n\nSky is one of Europe's leading entertainment companies operating in six territories, including three of the largest pay television markets in Western Europe: the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. The majority of our revenue is derived from our direct-toconsumer business, which has 23.0 million customer relationships, and primarily involves the distribution of a wide array of video channels  to  both  residential  and  business  customers.  We  also  offer  broadband,  voice  and  wireless  services  individually  and  as bundled services in select countries. We own a diverse portfolio of pay television channels that feature entertainment, news, sports and movies, which are included in our subscription video services and are also licensed through various distribution partnerships to third-party video providers to reach an additional 3 million households. We also generate revenue from the licensing of owned and licensed programming to third-party video providers and from the sale of advertising.\n\n## Direct-to-Consumer\n\n## Video\n\nOur  direct-to-home  ('DTH')  video  services  are  delivered  primarily  through  a  combination  of  both  satellite  transmission  and broadband connections that are marketed under the Sky brand in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Austria.

The current decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products or subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC products, while also increasing the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as current inflation in the domestic and global energy sector and other pronounced price increases generally and in certain other sectors, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. A decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our business plans, such as our plans to realign our cost structure and for the new DTC ad-supported service, pricing structure and price increases. In addition, actions to reduce inflation, including raising interest rates, increase our cost of borrowing, which in turn could make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments on favorable terms. Further, global economic conditions may impact foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar has adversely impacted the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and may reduce international demand for our products and services. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar may increase our labor, supply or other costs in non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries. Broader supply chain delays, such as those currently impacting global distribution may further exacerbate current inflationary pressures and impact our ability to sell and deliver goods or otherwise disrupt our operations. The adverse impact on our businesses of the decline in economic conditions will depend, in part, on its severity and duration and our ability to mitigate the impacts of this decline on our businesses will be limited.\n\n## Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.\n\nThe media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. This trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels, including for a number of our networks. In addition, theater-going to watch movies currently is, and may continue to be, below pre-COVID-19 levels. Declines in linear viewership have resulted in decreased advertising revenue. In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement changes to our business models, most recently by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, initiating plans to again reorganize our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies, and developing next generation storytelling offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, next generation storytelling offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution may increase the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. We expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources, particularly as we expand our DTC offerings. To date we have experienced significant losses in our DTC businesses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be profitable or as profitable as our existing or historic business models.\n\n## Misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment, travel and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.\n\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create compelling content, which may be distributed, among other ways, through broadcast, cable, internet or cellular technology, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products. Such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks, resorts, cruise ships and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for public or out-of-home",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Telev ision Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, ex cept it ex cludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title's unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the ex tent the title's unamortized costs ex ceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\n\n## Content Production Incentives\n\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as 'Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset's amortization period.\n\n## Internal-Use Software Costs\n\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.\n\n## Parks, Resorts and Other Property\n\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2024, DIS reported $36 million in amortization of right-of-use assets and $13 million in interest on lease liabilities under finance leases. GOOGL disclosed $413 million in amortization of lease assets and $31 million in interest on lease liabilities, while VZ reported $329 million in amortization of right-of-use assets and $98 million in interest on lease liabilities. These figures suggest that VZ carries a larger interest burden relative to amortization compared to GOOGL and DIS, which may reflect differences in lease financing structures or debt terms. GOOGL and DIS show lower interest costs, potentially indicating more favorable lease terms or shorter lease durations.",

      "answer": "Comcast reports 'Eliminations' as a negative adjustment of $8,383 million in 2024, consistent with the prior year. Disney also records eliminations as a reduction, amounting to $1,595 million in 2024, showing a 14% increase in this adjustment year-over-year. Verizon includes eliminations as a minor $256 million deduction in 2024, with only a slight increase from $253 million in 2023. The significant disparity in the scale of eliminations suggests that Comcast has much larger internal intercompany transactions that need to be removed to avoid double-counting, while Disney and especially Verizon have relatively smaller internal overlaps. The growing eliminations at Disney indicate increasing internal dependencies, whereas Verizon's stable and minimal eliminations suggest limited internal revenue overlap.",

GOOGL maintained a consistent level of redeemable noncontrolling interests at $1.1 billion for both 2023 and 2024, signaling a deliberate holding strategy for minority stakes, particularly in consolidated VIEs like Waymo.

The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not av ailable to us, and their creditors do not hav e recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $8.7 billion, respectiv ely and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, liabilities for which creditors only hav e recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectiv ely. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.\n\nWaymo,  a  fully  autonomous  driv ing  technology  company  and  a  consolidated  VIE,  receiv ed  $5.6  billion  in  funding  during  the  year  ended December 31, 2024, the majority of which was funded by Alphabet. Inv estments from external parties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023  and  2024,  total  noncontrolling  interests  (NCI)  in  our  consolidated  subsidiaries  were  $3.4  billion  and  $4.2  billion, respectiv ely, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&amp;E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&amp;E.\n\n## Unconsolidated VIEs\n\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include priv ate companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activ ities inv olv e power generation using renewable sources.\n\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activ ities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these inv estments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method inv estments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated  VIEs is generally based on the current carrying v alue of the inv estments and any future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE inv estments were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectiv ely.\n\n## Note 6. Debt\n\n## Short-Term Debt\n\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and $2.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted-av erage effectiv e  interest  rate  of 4.4%  as  of December 31, 2024.T he estimated fair v alue of the commercial paper approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2024\n\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\n\n## Long-Term Debt\n\nTotal outstanding long-term debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):\n\n",

      "answer": "META reported a 2023 provision for income taxes of $8,330 million, reflecting a 48% increase compared to 2022, with an effective tax rate of 18%. NFLX's 2023 provision was $797.4 million, showing a modest increase from $772.0 million in 2022, with a lower effective tax rate of 13%, driven by favorable foreign-derived deductions and R&D credits. VZ's 2023 provision was $4,892 million, down from $6,523 million in 2022, indicating a tax reduction aligned with lower profitability. META's rising tax provision aligns with improved earnings, NFLX benefits from aggressive tax credits and offshore structures, and VZ's decline reflects reduced income and restructuring charges.",

      "answer": "Google (GOOGL) utilizes Segment Operating Income to evaluate its segments and allocate resources, with the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CEO Sundar Pichai) using this metric during the annual planning process and performance assessments. However, certain AI-focused R&D costs, corporate initiatives, and shared costs are not allocated to segments. AT&T (T) reports Segment Operating Income as $27,135 million in 2024, distinguishing between operating segments and reconciling corporate-level items such as restructuring costs and amortization, which are excluded from segment-level performance. Verizon (VZ) also uses Segment Operating Income as the primary metric for evaluating performance and allocating resources across its Consumer and Business segments, with the CEO serving as the CODM and making decisions on capital expenditures, network expansion, and pricing based on this metric. Together, this shows that while all three companies rely on Segment Operating Income for strategic decision-making, they differ in what costs are excluded and how performance is translated into resource allocation.",

The CODM  uses segment operating income to allocate resources (including employees, financial or capital resources) and to assess performance during the monthly and quarterly financial strategic review process. When assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources, the CODM  focuses on evaluating whether revenues generated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate return on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM  using segment operating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network technologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's priorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks, establishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions, branding matters and people management.\n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:",

      "answer": "CMCSA used $10.9 billion in financing activities in 2024, representing a significant decrease in cash outflow compared to $19.9 billion in 2023, suggesting a more conservative approach to capital deployment or debt management. In contrast, DIS used $15,288 million in financing activities in 2024, a sharp increase from $2,724 million in 2023, indicating a more aggressive capital structure adjustment, potentially involving share repurchases or debt restructuring. T used $24,708 million in financing activities in 2024, primarily for debt repayments, dividend payments, and vendor financing, reflecting a focus on deleveraging and shareholder returns despite maintaining high debt levels ($99.1 billion as of 2024). Collectively, these differences highlight distinct capital priorities: CMCSA appears to be stabilizing its financial position, DIS is actively reshaping its capital structure, and T is managing a large debt load while maintaining dividends.",

These inflows were exceeded by cash used to meet the needs of the business, including, but not limited to, payment of operating expenses. The cash generated from operating activities was used to fund capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, repay short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and dividend payments to stockholders. We maintain availability under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.\n\nRefer to 'Contractual Obligations' discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements.\n\n## Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations\n\nDuring 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $38,771, compared to $38,314 in 2023, reflecting the timing of working capital associated with device payments, as well as the ex pansion of committed, cost-efficient receivable sales programs, and operational growth, partially offset by higher cash tax  payments.\n\nWe actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash. Among other things, we seek to make payments on 90day or greater terms, while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost (referred to as supplier financing program). In addition, for payments to suppliers of handset inventory, as part of our working capital initiatives, we have arrangements that allow us to extend the stated payment terms by up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (referred to as direct supplier financing). The net impact of direct supplier financing, including principal and interest payments, was to improve cash from operating activities $661 in 2024 and decrease cash from operating activities $299 in 2023. All supplier financing payments are due within one year. (See Note 22)\n\n## Cash Used in Investing Activities from Continuing Operations\n\nDuring 2024, cash used in investing activities totaled $17,490, consisting primarily of $20,263 (including interest during construction) for capital ex penditures. During 2024, net FirstNet sustainability payments were $237. In 2024, we received a return of investment of $928 from DIRECTV representing distributions in excess of cumulative equity in earnings from DIRECTV (see Note 10) and sold Rabbi Trust and other investments totaling $2,575.\n\nFor capital improvements, we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more (referred to as vendor financing) with some of our vendors, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Vendor financing payments were $1,792 in 2024, compared to $5,742 in 2023. Capital expenditures in 2024 were $20,263, and when including $1,792 cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $22,055 ($1,540 lower than the prior year).\n\nThe vast majority of our capital ex penditures are spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. In 2024, we placed $700 of productive assets (primarily software) in service under vendor financing arrangements (compared to $2,651 in 2023).\n\nThe amount of capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products, capacity needs and network enhancements. In 2025, we expect that our capital investment, which includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing, will be in the $22,000 range.\n\n## Cash Provided by or Used in Financing Activities from Continuing Operations\n\nIn 2024, cash used in financing activities totaled $24,708 and was comprised of debt repayments, payments of dividends and vendor financing payments.\n\n## A tabular summary of our debt activity during 2024 is as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWhile a portion of our customers are subject to contracts for their services, which are typically 1 month to 2 years in length, based on our evaluation of the terms of these contracts, we recognize revenue for these services primarily on a basis that is consistent with our customers that are not subject to contracts and recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Installation fees for these customers are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of benefit to the  customer,  which  is  less  than  a  year.  Certain  international  customers  are  under  contracts,  with  terms  typically  ranging  from  rolling  monthly  to  24  months, depending on the service, and may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We recognize revenue for these customers as the services are provided over the contract period. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned from these customers related to existing agreements is equal  to  less  than 10%  of  our  annual  Residential  Connectivity  &amp;  Platforms  revenue  and  will  generally  be  recognized  within 24  months.  Sales  commissions  are generally expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a year. Sales commissions for the international customers under contract are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\nOur services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as wireless gateways and set-top boxes, that are generally considered part of our services for revenue recognition. We recognize revenue from the sale of devices, including wireless devices and Sky G lass smart televisions, when they are transferred to the customer. Under an equipment installment plan, customers typically have the option to finance wireless devices and Sky G lass smart televisions interest-free over 24 months, and up to 48 months for international customers. Equipment installment plan receivables under these arrangements are recorded net of imputed interest when the devices are transferred to the customer.\n\nWe also have arrangements to sell certain DTC streaming services to our customers. We have concluded we are the sales agent in these arrangements, and we record net commission revenue as earned, which is generally as customers are billed on a monthly basis, within domestic broadband and international connectivity revenue.\n\nUnder the terms of our domestic cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay the cable franchising authority an amount based on gross video revenue. We generally pass these and other similar fees through to our domestic customers and classify these fees in the respective Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms services revenue, with the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses.\n\n## Advertising\n\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising and technology, tools and solutions relating to advertising businesses. As part of distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to advertisers. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our owned Sky-branded entertainment television networks and our digital platforms. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to the third parties in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions.\n\nWe have determined that a contract exists for our advertising sales arrangements once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or delivered within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally  require  payment  within 30  to 60  days  from  when  advertisements  are  aired  or  delivered.  We  also  provide  technology,  tools,  data-driven  services  and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate the more effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences and recognize revenue when these services are provided.\n\n## Business Services Connectivity Segment\n\nBusiness Services Connectivity generates revenue from subscribers to a variety of our products and services which are offered to businesses. Our connectivity service offerings for small business locations in the United States primarily include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services that are similar to those provided to our residential customers and include certain other features specific to businesses. Our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises also include ethernet network services, advanced voice services and a software-defined networking product. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWhile a portion of our customers are subject to contracts for their services, which are typically 1 month to 2 years in length, based on our evaluation of the terms of these contracts, we recognize revenue for these services primarily on a basis that is consistent with our customers that are not subject to contracts and recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Installation fees for these customers are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of benefit to the  customer,  which  is  less  than  a  year.  Certain  international  customers  are  under  contracts,  with  terms  typically  ranging  from  rolling  monthly  to  24  months, depending on the service, and may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We recognize revenue for these customers as the services are provided over the contract period. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned from these customers related to existing agreements is equal  to  less  than 10%  of  our  annual  Residential  Connectivity  &amp;  Platforms  revenue  and  will  generally  be  recognized  within 24  months.  Sales  commissions  are generally expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a year. Sales commissions for the international customers under contract are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\nOur services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as wireless gateways and set-top boxes, that are generally considered part of our services for revenue recognition. We recognize revenue from the sale of devices, including wireless devices and Sky G lass smart televisions, when they are transferred to the customer. Under an equipment installment plan, customers typically have the option to finance wireless devices and Sky G lass smart televisions interest-free over 24 months, and up to 48 months for international customers. Equipment installment plan receivables under these arrangements are recorded net of imputed interest when the devices are transferred to the customer.\n\nWe also have arrangements to sell certain DTC streaming services to our customers. We have concluded we are the sales agent in these arrangements, and we record net commission revenue as earned, which is generally as customers are billed on a monthly basis, within domestic broadband and international connectivity revenue.\n\nUnder the terms of our domestic cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay the cable franchising authority an amount based on gross video revenue. We generally pass these and other similar fees through to our domestic customers and classify these fees in the respective Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms services revenue, with the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses.\n\n## Advertising\n\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising and technology, tools and solutions relating to advertising businesses. As part of distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to advertisers. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our owned Sky-branded entertainment television networks and our digital platforms. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to the third parties in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions.\n\nWe have determined that a contract exists for our advertising sales arrangements once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or delivered within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally  require  payment  within 30  to 60  days  from  when  advertisements  are  aired  or  delivered.  We  also  provide  technology,  tools,  data-driven  services  and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate the more effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences and recognize revenue when these services are provided.\n\n## Business Services Connectivity Segment\n\nBusiness Services Connectivity generates revenue from subscribers to a variety of our products and services which are offered to businesses. Our connectivity service offerings for small business locations in the United States primarily include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services that are similar to those provided to our residential customers and include certain other features specific to businesses. Our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises also include ethernet network services, advanced voice services and a software-defined networking product. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or publicly release any revision to any such forward-looking statement, except as may otherwise be required by law.\n\n## Item 1. Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix , Inc. ('Netflix ', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approx imately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We aim to offer a range of pricing plans, including our ad-supported subscription plan, to meet a variety of consumer needs. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers' leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\n\n## SEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.",

      "question": "How have Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Netflix (NFLX) each adjusted their capital spending on property and equipment in 2023 compared to prior years, and what does this reveal about their differing investment strategies in infrastructure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Google reported purchases of property and equipment at $32.251 billion, showing a slight increase from $31.485 billion in 2022. Meta reported a decline in purchases from $31.431 billion in 2022 to $27.266 billion in 2023, indicating a strategic reduction. Netflix, in contrast, spent $348.552 million on property and equipment in 2023, a decrease from $407.729 million in 2022, reflecting a more modest investment approach. These figures suggest that while Google maintained or slightly increased its infrastructure investment, Meta scaled back, and Netflix significantly reduced its capital spending, highlighting distinct strategic priorities across the three companies.",

DIS incorporates the impact of existing and terminated interest rate and cross-currency swaps, purchase accounting adjustments, and debt issuance premiums, discounts, and costs, noting $1.6 billion in net premiums at the end of fiscal 2024. VZ defines effective interest rate as the actual interest incurred divided by average debt outstanding, which includes the impact of discounts, premiums, and unamortized debt issuance costs, and notes a rise in interest costs due to a higher average interest rate.

      "answer": "CMCSA evaluates reporting units by aggregating components with similar economic characteristics and tests goodwill for impairment quantitatively or qualitatively. In 2022, it recorded an $8.1 billion goodwill impairment in its Sky reporting unit due to macroeconomic conditions and higher discount rates. DIS bypassed the qualitative assessment in fiscal 2024 and performed a quantitative impairment test, using discounted cash flows and market multiples, with significant judgment applied to projected revenues, operating margins, and discount rates. GOOGL evaluates reporting units periodically and reallocates goodwill using a relative fair value approach, but reported no material goodwill impairments, indicating a potentially more stable or resilient portfolio of reporting units. These differences suggest that CMCSA and DIS are more exposed to macroeconomic volatility in their reporting units, while GOOGL may maintain tighter control or more consistent performance across its units.",

Amounts are impacted by foreign currency translation each period.\n\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from anticipated synergies and intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including increased footprint,  assembled  workforce,  noncontractual  relationships  and  other  agreements.  We  assess  the  recoverability  of  our  goodwill  annually,  or  more  frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level.  To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.\n\nIn 2022, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $8.1 billion in our Sky reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. When performing this analysis, we also considered multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions. The decline in fair value primarily resulted from an increased discount rate and reduced estimated future cash flows as a result of macroeconomic conditions in the Sky territories. The impairment is presented in goodwill and long-lived asset impairments in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit ex ceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the ex cess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment (see Note 18).\n\nThe impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model relate to projections of future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. Discount rates for each reporting unit are determined based on the inherent risks of each reporting unit's underlying operations. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ.\n\nTo test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets ex ceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the ex cess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our trademarks and FCC licenses, which are our most significant indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 5 to 40 years. The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe Company expects its aggregate annual amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for fiscal 2025 through 2029 to be as follows:\n\n",

We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we hav e the power to direct activ ities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and hav e the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits.  If we are not the primary beneficiary in a  VIE, we account for the inv estment or other v ariable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\n\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment is comprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets currently in serv ice, and assets not yet in serv ice.  T echnical  infrastructure  includes  data  center  land,  buildings  and  leasehold  improv ements,  and  serv ers  and  network  equipment.  Office  space includes office land, buildings and leasehold improv ements. Assets not yet in serv ice are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data center buildings and serv ers in the process of construction or assembly.\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets are ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method ov er the estimated useful liv es of the assets, which we regularly ev aluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and utilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings ov er periods of sev en  to 40 years.  We depreciate serv ers  and  network  equipment generally ov er a period of six years.  We depreciate corporate and other assets ov er periods of two  to 25  years.  We depreciate leasehold improv ements ov er the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful liv es of the assets. Land is not depreciated.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We ev aluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relativ e fair v alue allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components.  Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\n\nCertain lease agreements contain v ariable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\n\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present v alue of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present v alue of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily  determinable.  Our  incremental  borrowing  rate  is  estimated  to  approximate  the  interest  rate  on  a  collateralized  basis  with  similar  terms  and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentiv es.\n\nLease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.\n\nOperating lease expense (excluding v ariable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the lease term.  Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recov erable.

      "question": "How do CMCSA, Meta, and Netflix differ in the scale and composition of their Property and Equipment, net investments as of 2023, and what might these differences suggest about their respective capital intensity and operational models?",
      "answer": "CMCSA reported Property and Equipment, net of $59.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, with a breakdown showing $48.7 billion in the U.S. and $11.0 billion internationally, indicating a significant but geographically diversified infrastructure base. Meta had a much higher Property and Equipment, net of $96,587 million as of the same date, reflecting its heavy investment in global data centers and technology infrastructure. Netflix reported Property and Equipment, net of $1,491,444 thousand (or $1.49 billion), with a detailed breakdown showing major investments in leasehold improvements, IT infrastructure, and content-related equipment, but at a much smaller scale compared to the other two. These differences suggest that Meta operates the most capital-intensive model focused on infrastructure ownership, CMCSA maintains a hybrid model with both domestic and international assets, and Netflix leverages a lighter asset footprint, likely outsourcing more of its infrastructure needs.",

      "answer": "Disney's effective tax rate increased from 23.7% in 2024 from 28.9% in 2023, driven by non-deductible impairments and differences in foreign income taxation. Meta experienced a decline in its effective tax rate to 12% in 2024 from 18% in 2023, reflecting improved tax planning or reduced exposure to higher-tax jurisdictions. Netflix maintained a relatively stable effective tax rate of 13% in 2024, compared to 13% in 2023 and a decrease from 15% in 2022, suggesting consistent tax management despite rising provision for income taxes. Collectively, these trends indicate differing tax planning strategies and varying degrees of success in managing tax liabilities within the communication services sector.",

      "answer": "Disney reported $32 million in distributions and other equity changes in 2023, which included dividends of $1,379 million and common stock repurchases of $2,992 million, indicating a significant return of capital to shareholders. AT&T faced $5,414 million in total distributions related to preferred interests, including $373 million in annual cash distributions on remaining preferred interests before their full redemption in April 2023, reflecting a focus on restructuring its capital base. Verizon paid $11,082 million in dividends during 2023 but made no significant stock repurchases, showing a more conservative and dividend-focused capital return approach. These differences highlight Disney's aggressive capital return, AT&T's emphasis on preferred interest redemption, and Verizon's steady dividend policy.",

On December 27, 2022, the AT&T pension trust provided written notice of its right to require us to purchase the remaining 213 million, or approximately $5,340, of Mobility preferred interests outstanding. The terms of the instruments limited the amount we were required to redeem in any 12-month period to approximately 107 million shares, or $2,670. With the certainty of redemption, the Mobility preferred interests were reclassified from equity to a liability at fair value, with approximately $2,670 recorded in current liabilities as 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities,' representing the amount required to be redeemed within one year, and $2,670 recorded in 'Other noncurrent liabilities.' The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Notes 12 and 14). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interest for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414. |\n| Tower Holdings Preferred Interests In 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| The membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the 'Tower preferred interests'). The September series (Tower Class A-1) of the preferred interests totals $1,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and the December series (Tower Class A-2) totals $4,500 and pays an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower preferred interests would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning five years from the issuance date or upon the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the underlying assets. The Tower preferred interests are included in 'Noncontrolling interest' on the consolidated balance sheets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| The holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Telco LLC Preferred Interests In September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunication-related assets.

      "answer": "CMCSA notes that rising content costs, particularly for sports programming, have significantly increased over time and could negatively impact their profitability if revenue from these contracts does not exceed costs. GOOGL reports a notable increase in content acquisition costs as part of a $13.0 billion rise in cost of revenues in 2024, driven largely by YouTube-related expenses. NFLX provides detailed accounting practices for content, including amortization strategies and tax incentives, and highlights that over 90% of licensed or produced content is expected to be amortized within four years, indicating a structured financial approach to managing content costs. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face rising content costs, they differ in how they account for and manage these expenses, with CMCSA expressing caution, GOOGL showing direct financial impact, and NFLX emphasizing structured amortization and tax incentives.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe number of entertainment choices available to consumers, including DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, social networking and user-generated content platforms,  and  gaming  and  virtual  reality  products  and  services,  continue  to  increase,  intensify  audience  fragmentation  and  disaggregate  how  content traditionally has been distributed to and viewed by consumers. The continuing trend of content owners, including us with Peacock, delivering their content directly to  consumers,  rather  than  through,  or  in  addition  to,  traditional  video  distribution  channels  also  disrupts  traditional  media  distribution  business  models.  As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming services in lieu of linear video services, which continue to experience accelerated net customer losses, our video customers and video revenues, and linear television network subscriber fees received from video service providers, each decrease. In addition to reducing traditional television viewership, these trends when coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our television networks. Shifting content consumption patterns also may result in lower demand for home entertainment products or theatrical attendance. While we have adapted some of our video and content offerings to compete in the evolving media distribution landscape, such as by offering Peacock and NOW, there also can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete or that Peacock will grow or sustain its revenue or user base, successfully compete as a stand-alone DTC streaming service or fully offset decreases to our linear television networks' results of operations.\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nWe compete for the sale of advertising time with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers as advertisers have shifted, and may continue to shift, a larger portion of their total expenditures to digital media. We also compete with other online content providers, such as social  networking  platforms  and  user-generated  content  providers,  television  networks  and  stations,  and  all  other  advertising  platforms.  Because  we  derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models or on Peacock, could negatively impact our results of operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, declines caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries and economic conditions generally; increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, audience fragmentation and viewing content on DTC streaming services; use of time-shifting or advertising-blocking technologies; and regulatory intervention on advertising placement. Lower audience ratings  and  reduced  viewership,  which  many  of  our  linear  television  networks  have  ex perienced,  and  likely  will  continue  to  ex perience,  as  well  as  the  level  of popularity of Peacock, affect advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us and the rates paid. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\n\nWe create and acquire media, sports and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. To meet the changing preferences of our consumer markets, we must consistently create, acquire, market and distribute a broad array of content and theme park attractions. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in content, such as the production of films and original content for television networks and streaming services, and in the creation of new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance.\n\nWe obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense. Entering into or renewing contracts for such content rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in significantly increased costs, potentially over an extended contractual term. Particularly with respect to contracts for sports rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own DTC services. There can be no assurance that revenue generated from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights and of producing and distributing the programming. In addition, media companies may determine not to license popular content to us, and as more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these contracts on acceptable terms could reduce the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our results of operations and businesses.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

The TAC rate decreased from 21.4% to 20.7% from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to a rev enue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search &amp; other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search &amp; other rev enues increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically ex pect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title's launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in 'Other current assets' or 'Other non-current assets' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in 'Content assets, net') and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in 'Cost of revenues') on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are ex pected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases as well as net operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax  assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax  assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings and future tax able income, and prudent and feasible tax  planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future tax able income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.",

DIS provides a detailed breakdown of its content portfolio, showing a total of $29.159 billion in produced and licensed content as of September 28, 2024, with $18.189 billion in produced content and $5.251 billion in licensed content. NFLX discloses a massive $21.713 billion in content obligations, split between $10.329 billion in the next 12 months and $11.384 billion beyond, indicating a high level of near-term financial commitment to content.

AT&T, by contrast, used $17.49 billion in cash for investing activities, primarily driven by $20.263 billion in capital expenditures, showing a strong emphasis on network and infrastructure development.

These inflows were exceeded by cash used to meet the needs of the business, including, but not limited to, payment of operating expenses. The cash generated from operating activities was used to fund capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, repay short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and dividend payments to stockholders. We maintain availability under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.\n\nRefer to 'Contractual Obligations' discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements.\n\n## Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations\n\nDuring 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $38,771, compared to $38,314 in 2023, reflecting the timing of working capital associated with device payments, as well as the ex pansion of committed, cost-efficient receivable sales programs, and operational growth, partially offset by higher cash tax  payments.\n\nWe actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash. Among other things, we seek to make payments on 90day or greater terms, while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost (referred to as supplier financing program). In addition, for payments to suppliers of handset inventory, as part of our working capital initiatives, we have arrangements that allow us to extend the stated payment terms by up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (referred to as direct supplier financing). The net impact of direct supplier financing, including principal and interest payments, was to improve cash from operating activities $661 in 2024 and decrease cash from operating activities $299 in 2023. All supplier financing payments are due within one year. (See Note 22)\n\n## Cash Used in Investing Activities from Continuing Operations\n\nDuring 2024, cash used in investing activities totaled $17,490, consisting primarily of $20,263 (including interest during construction) for capital ex penditures. During 2024, net FirstNet sustainability payments were $237. In 2024, we received a return of investment of $928 from DIRECTV representing distributions in excess of cumulative equity in earnings from DIRECTV (see Note 10) and sold Rabbi Trust and other investments totaling $2,575.\n\nFor capital improvements, we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more (referred to as vendor financing) with some of our vendors, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Vendor financing payments were $1,792 in 2024, compared to $5,742 in 2023. Capital expenditures in 2024 were $20,263, and when including $1,792 cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $22,055 ($1,540 lower than the prior year).\n\nThe vast majority of our capital ex penditures are spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. In 2024, we placed $700 of productive assets (primarily software) in service under vendor financing arrangements (compared to $2,651 in 2023).\n\nThe amount of capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products, capacity needs and network enhancements. In 2025, we expect that our capital investment, which includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing, will be in the $22,000 range.\n\n## Cash Provided by or Used in Financing Activities from Continuing Operations\n\nIn 2024, cash used in financing activities totaled $24,708 and was comprised of debt repayments, payments of dividends and vendor financing payments.\n\n## A tabular summary of our debt activity during 2024 is as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2024, META reported total liabilities and equity of $276.054 billion, with total liabilities at $93.417 billion and stockholders' equity at $182.637 billion. T reported total liabilities and equity of $394.795 billion, with total liabilities at $276.550 billion and stockholders' equity at $118.245 billion. VZ reported total liabilities and equity of $384.711 billion, with total liabilities at $284.136 billion and equity at $100.575 billion. META maintains a significantly higher equity position relative to liabilities, suggesting a more equity-driven capital structure. In contrast, both T and VZ carry larger liabilities relative to equity, indicating a more debt-heavy financial strategy. This contrast highlights differing approaches to capital structure and financial risk among the three communication services companies.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and META each approach the financial treatment of finite-lived intangible assets, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies following acquisitions?",
      "answer": "CMCSA amortizes finite-lived intangible assets such as customer relationships and intellectual property on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with amortization expense detailed in a provided table. DIS similarly amortizes finite-lived intangible assets over periods ranging from 5 to 40 years and expects its aggregate annual amortization expense for these assets to follow a specific forecast for fiscal years 2025 through 2029. META, while not providing a detailed amortization schedule, highlights that acquisitions have led to the recognition of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on its balance sheet, which result in significant additional expenses to its results of operations. Comparatively, CMCSA emphasizes structured amortization planning, DIS provides forward-looking expense expectations, and META focuses on the financial impact and risks associated with acquiring finite-lived intangible assets.",

      "question": "How do DIS, GOOGL, and NFLX each explain the factors influencing their 2024 effective tax rates, and what does this reveal about their respective tax planning strategies and operational structures?",
      "answer": "DIS reported a significantly higher effective tax rate of 23.7% in 2024, driven primarily by non-tax-deductible impairments (8.8%) and fluctuations in tax audit reserves and foreign tax differentials. In contrast, GOOGL's effective tax rate was lower at 16.4%, with favorable impacts from foreign-derived intangible income deductions (3.8%) offset by higher state taxes and stock-based compensation expenses. NFLX maintained a much lower effective tax rate of 13% in 2024, with minimal year-over-year change, indicating stable tax planning and potentially greater use of international structures or credits. These differences suggest that DIS faces more domestic tax pressures and impairment-related volatility, while GOOGL and NFLX benefit from more aggressive international tax optimization and consistent application of tax credits.",

GOOGL allocates goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations and evaluates reporting units periodically, particularly when changes in operating segments occur, using a relative fair value allocation approach when necessary.

While all three companies use reporting units for goodwill evaluation, DIS emphasizes qualitative and quantitative tests with internal projections and discount rates, GOOGL focuses on fair value reallocation with changes in structure, and META explicitly defines and tests two separate reporting units, indicating differing levels of granularity and strategic segmentation in their impairment approaches.",

The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit ex ceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the ex cess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment (see Note 18).\n\nThe impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model relate to projections of future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. Discount rates for each reporting unit are determined based on the inherent risks of each reporting unit's underlying operations. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ.\n\nTo test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets ex ceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the ex cess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our trademarks and FCC licenses, which are our most significant indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 5 to 40 years. The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe Company expects its aggregate annual amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for fiscal 2025 through 2029 to be as follows:\n\n",

We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we hav e the power to direct activ ities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and hav e the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits.  If we are not the primary beneficiary in a  VIE, we account for the inv estment or other v ariable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\n\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment is comprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets currently in serv ice, and assets not yet in serv ice.  T echnical  infrastructure  includes  data  center  land,  buildings  and  leasehold  improv ements,  and  serv ers  and  network  equipment.  Office  space includes office land, buildings and leasehold improv ements. Assets not yet in serv ice are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data center buildings and serv ers in the process of construction or assembly.\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets are ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method ov er the estimated useful liv es of the assets, which we regularly ev aluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and utilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings ov er periods of sev en  to 40 years.  We depreciate serv ers  and  network  equipment generally ov er a period of six years.  We depreciate corporate and other assets ov er periods of two  to 25  years.  We depreciate leasehold improv ements ov er the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful liv es of the assets. Land is not depreciated.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We ev aluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relativ e fair v alue allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components.  Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\n\nCertain lease agreements contain v ariable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\n\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present v alue of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present v alue of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily  determinable.  Our  incremental  borrowing  rate  is  estimated  to  approximate  the  interest  rate  on  a  collateralized  basis  with  similar  terms  and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentiv es.\n\nLease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.\n\nOperating lease expense (excluding v ariable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the lease term.  Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recov erable. The ev aluation is performed",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We record such losses as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income.\n\nIf we determine that a loss is probable or reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The ex cess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangibles Assets\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. G oodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units, Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL), subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2024, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such  assets  may  not  be  recoverable.  The  evaluation  of  these  intangible  assets  are  performed  at  the  lowest  level  for  which  identifiable  cash  flows  are  largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. The impairment charges of finitelived intangible assets were not material during the reporting periods presented.\n\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets.  If  we  change  the  estimated  useful  life  assumption  for  any  asset,  the  remaining  unamortized  balance  is  amortized  over  the  revised  estimated  useful  life. Intangible assets are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive",

      "answer": "CMCSA leverages content distribution through major sports rights agreements, including exclusive NBA and NFL game broadcasting rights across its networks and Peacock, which are critical to driving subscriber engagement and advertising revenue. DIS has shifted its media and entertainment operations into two distinct segments\u2014Entertainment and Sports\u2014aligning content distribution with strategic curation decisions that led to content removals and impairment charges, reflecting a recalibration of its DTC strategy. META, on the other hand, faces challenges in content distribution due to algorithmic changes that reduce user engagement and the prioritization of Reels, which monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories. These differing approaches highlight CMCSA\u2019s focus on live sports as a distribution anchor, DIS\u2019s strategic reorganization to optimize content value, and META\u2019s struggle to balance user engagement with monetization in a shifting content ecosystem.",

A certain number of NBA games w ill also be distributed in the S panish language on Telemundo.\n\n(b) Includes the rights to produce and distribute on NBC  and on Peacock a specified number of regular season games that includes S unday Night Football games, Thursday Kickoff games and Thanksgiving night games, playoff games, and three remaining S uper Bow l games, the next of w hich is in  February 2026.  The agreement expires after the 2033-34 season, w ith a termination right available to the NFL after the 2029-30 season. The agreement also includes rights to additional exclusive games on Peacock. All of the NFL games are also distributed in the S panish language on Universo or Telemundo.\n\n(c) Includes the unilateral right by the other party (i.e., the licensor) to the agreement, under certain circumstances, to shorten the term of the agreement by one year.\n\nOur  television  and  streaming  business  competes  for  the  acquisition  of  content,  including  sports  rights,  and  for  on-air  and  creative  talent  primarily  with  other television networks,  DTC streaming providers, and local broadcast television stations.  In  Europe, major sports rights, which are significant to our international networks, are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a 3 to 5 year period.\n\n## Studios Segment\n\nOur Studios segment primarily includes our NBCUniversal and Sky film and television studio production and distribution operations. Our studio production facilities primarily include our owned Universal City location in Los Angeles, California and our leased studios in Atlanta, G eorgia and in Elstree, United Kingdom. Revenue is generated primarily from the worldwide licensing of our owned film and television content and from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. We also generate revenue from the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products, as well as the production and licensing of live stage plays and the distribution of content produced by third parties.\n\n## Film Studios\n\nOur film studios develop, produce, acquire, market and distribute filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the following names:\n\n- Universal Pictures\n- Illumination\n- DreamWorks Animation\n- Focus Features\n- Working Title\n\nWe distribute the majority of our films initially for ex hibition in movie theaters, while other films are initially distributed through licensing agreements. After their initial release, we distribute films globally to different customers over multiple licensing windows. We license films, including recent films and selections from our film library, which is comprised of more than 6,500 movies in a variety of genres, to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, and to video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers. This includes licenses to our Media and Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segments. Certain films are also licensed to our Media segment and made available for viewing on Peacock on the same date as the theatrical release. We also distribute films globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products. Additionally, we acquire distribution rights to films produced by third parties, which may be limited to particular geographic regions, specific forms of media or certain periods of time. Theatrical revenue is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films we distribute, their acceptance by audiences, the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sales retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The success of a film in movie theaters is generally a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding licensing windows and through physical and digital home entertainment product sales.\n\nWe develop and produce films both alone and jointly with other studios or production companies. In certain cases, we have also entered into film co-financing arrangements with third party studios and non-studio entities to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor. Investors generally assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film.\n\nIn connection with film studio productions, we typically owe 'residuals' payments to individuals hired under collective bargaining agreements, which are generally calculated based on post-theatrical or content licensing revenue.  We also typically owe 'participations' payments to creative talent, to third parties under cofinancing agreements and to other parties involved in content production, which are generally based on the financial performance of the content.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

In addition, third-party suppliers provide products and services essential to the operation of a number of our businesses. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties or materially impacted a supplier of a significant product or service, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected. In specific geographic markets, we have experienced delayed and/or partial payments from certain third parties due to liquidity issues.\n\nWe obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including certain physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we ex perience losses not covered by our insurance, which could be material.\n\n## We face risks related to changes in our business strategy, which have affected and may continue to affect our cost structure, the profitability of our businesses and/or the value of our assets.\n\nWe adjust our business strategies from time to time in connection with changes in senior management and in our efforts to respond to changes in technology, consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, acceptance of our entertainment offerings, the market for advertising, macroeconomic conditions and other changes in the business environment. For example, in fiscal 2024, we announced entering into a definitive agreement to transfer Star India into a joint venture and related impairment charges; in fiscal 2023, we reorganized our media and entertainment operations, which had been previously reported in one segment, into two segments, Entertainment and Sports; in fiscal 2023 we announced that we would review content, primarily on our DTC services, for alignment with a strategic change in our approach to content curation, resulting in removal of certain content from our platforms and related impairment charges; in fiscal 2022, we announced plans to introduce an ad-supported Disney+ service, new pricing model and price increases and cost realignment; and we have announced exploration of a number of new types of businesses. Changes in strategy, such as was the case with the most recent reorganization of our media and entertainment operations, can lead to workforce disruptions. Our new business strategies are, among other things, subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits, such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value. For example, notwithstanding our continuing efforts to rationalize costs, the cost of executing on our DTC strategy may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which may impact our distribution strategy across businesses/distribution platforms, the types of content we distribute through various businesses/distribution platforms, the timing and sequencing of content windows and ultimately, the profitability of our DTC products and other businesses/distribution platforms. Over the long term, our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies.\n\nIn addition, changing technology, consumer purchasing patterns and acceptance of content offerings and macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. We incur costs in connection with changes to our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to write-down the value of our assets. Among other assets, we have impaired the value of our content primarily at our DTC services and goodwill and intangible assets at our linear networks and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets. We may write down other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the business environment.\n\nWe also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. For example, in fiscal 2024, we announced plans for additional expansion of our fleet of cruise ships, and in recent years to ex pand investment in our Ex periences segment. In addition, in recent years, we have made significant investments in our businesses, such as expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks, additional cruise ships, the acquisition of TFCF Corporation (TFCF) and investments related to DTC offerings. The ultimate success of these investments is uncertain, some of these and future investments may ultimately result in returns that are negative or lower than anticipated, and these investments may impact the resources available to, and the profitability of, our other businesses. In addition, our costs increase in connection with these investments, such as additional ex penses incurred with the launch on new cruise ships, and we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets if the investments are not as successful as anticipated, as occurred in connection with the closure of Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser. Even if our strategies are effective in the long term, our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term, results of our new offerings are unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not ex pand into new markets as or when anticipated. Our ability to forecast for new businesses is impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses, speed with which the competitive landscape changes, volatility beyond our control (such as the events beyond our control noted above) and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based. Accordingly, we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes.",

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

      "question": "How do Disney (DIS), Google (GOOGL), and AT&T (T) compare in their 2024 finance lease cost structures, particularly in terms of amortization of lease assets and interest on lease liabilities, and what might this suggest about their respective capital intensity and financing strategies in the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Disney (DIS) reported a finance lease cost of $36 million for amortization and $13 million for interest on lease liabilities, indicating a relatively small finance lease footprint. Google (GOOGL) had a much higher finance lease cost at $413 million for amortization and $31 million for interest, suggesting a more asset-intensive approach in its operations. AT&T (T) showed a finance lease cost structure with $205 million in amortization and $171 million in interest, reflecting a more debt-like lease financing model. These differences highlight varying degrees of capital investment and financing strategies across the three companies in the communication services sector.",

      "answer": "Google attributes a significant $5.2 billion portion of its $7.1 billion cost of revenues increase to 'Other Cost of Revenues', citing higher content acquisition costs for YouTube and $479 million in severance charges from workforce reductions. Netflix reports a $376 million rise in 'Other Cost of Revenues' driven by expenses tied to content acquisition, licensing, and production, reflecting its ongoing investment in expanding its content library. AT&T, while not providing a dollar figure, discloses that 'Other Cost of Revenues' includes amortization of customer contract acquisition and fulfillment costs, indicating a focus on customer retention and service delivery. Together, these perspectives show that while all three Communication Services firms report increases in 'Other Cost of Revenues', the underlying drivers differ significantly\u2014Google emphasizes content and restructuring, Netflix highlights content investment, and AT&T focuses on customer-related operational costs.",

DIS discloses total undiscounted future lease payments of $4,664 million for operating leases and $470 million for financing leases, with 'Less: Imputed Interest' of $1,152 million and $280 million, respectively, leading to reported lease liabilities of $3,512 million and $190 million. GOOGL shows total future lease payments of $17,682 million, with 'Less: Imputed Interest' of $2,431 million, resulting in a total lease liability of $15,251 million. Comparing these figures, GOOGL has the highest lease liability after imputed interest, indicating a more aggressive lease financing strategy, while DIS maintains a more balanced approach between operating and financing leases. CMCSA's significant lease obligation reflects its capital-intensive infrastructure needs.",

      "answer": "Google reported an increase in accounts receivable, net from $40,258 million in 2022 to $47,964 million in 2023, indicating a growth in credit sales or slower collection periods. Meta also saw an increase from $13,466 million in 2022 to $16,169 million in 2023, suggesting similar trends in its advertising-driven revenue model. Verizon, however, maintained a relatively stable accounts receivable, net, rising slightly from $24,506 million in 2022 to $25,085 million in 2023, reflecting its more consistent billing and collection practices in telecom services. These differences highlight variations in how each company manages credit risk and cash flow within their operational models.",

      "answer": "Disney reported an actuarial loss in 2024 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations compared to the prior year, while in 2023 the loss was attributed to changes in postretirement medical benefit options. AT&T experienced an actuarial loss of $56 in 2024 related to the remeasurement of benefit plan assets and obligations, a significant improvement from the $1,594 in losses recorded in 2023. Verizon, in contrast, reported a net actuarial gain of $1.4 billion in 2024, driven by an increase in the discount rate assumption from 5.0% to 5.8% for pension plans and 5.0% to 5.6% for postretirement plans, along with a $200 million settlement gain from a pension annuitization transaction. These differences indicate that while all three companies are sensitive to actuarial assumptions, Disney and AT&T were negatively impacted by declining discount rates, whereas Verizon benefited from rising rates and proactive pension risk management.",

The increase reflects cash distributions received by AT&amp;T in excess of the carrying amount of our investment in DIRECTV, partially offset by the performance of our investment in DIRECTV (see Notes 10 and 19).\n\nOther income (expense) - net increased in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by actuarial remeasurement of benefit plan assets and obligations, with an actuarial loss of $56 in 2024, compared to net actuarial and settlement losses of $1,594 in 2023 (see Note 14). Also contributing to the increase was the prior-year writedown of our SKY Mexico equity investment. These increases were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit credits and lower returns on other benefit-related investments.\n\nIncome tax expense increased in 2024. While our income before income taxes decreased in 2024, it includes a goodwill impairment associated with our Business Wireline reporting unit, which is not deductible for tax  purposes and results in a higher effective tax  rate. Our effective tax  rate was 26.6% in 2024, 21.3% in 2023, and (122.2)% in 2022. The effective tax  rate in 2022 was also impacted by goodwill impairments, which are not deductible for tax  purposes.\n\nSegment Results Our segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly.

With these contributions, the funded ratio of each of the Pension Plans does not change as a result of this transaction.\n\nPension plan assets and liabilities are primarily presented within Employee benefit obligations in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Actuarial (Gain) Loss, Net\n\nThe net actuarial gain in 2024 is primarily the result of a $1.4 billion gain ($764 million in our pension plans and $656 million in our postretirement benefit plans) due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 5.0% for both our pension and postretirement plans at December 31, 2023 to a weighted-average of 5.8% for our pension plans and 5.6% for our postretirement plans at December 31, 2024, as well as a net pre-tax settlement gain of $200 million resulting from the pension annuitization transaction discussed above.\n\nThe net actuarial loss in 2023 is primarily the result of a $534 million loss in our postretirement benefit plans due to an increase in our healthcare cost trend rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 6.6% at December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average of 7.3% at December 31, 2023; and a $503 million loss ($288 million in our pension plans and $215 million in our postretirement benefit plans) due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Plan Amendments\n\nThe reclassifications from the amounts recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a result of collective bargaining agreements and plan amendments made in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022 resulted in a net increase to net periodic benefit cost and net decrease to pre-tax income of an insignificant amount during 2024. The similar reclassifications resulted in a net decrease to net periodic benefit cost and net increase to pre-tax income of $252 million during 2023 and $390 million during 2022.\n\nInformation for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How do GOOGL, META, and NFLX each compare in their 2023 provision for income taxes relative to their recent historical trends, and what does this reveal about their respective tax planning strategies and effective tax rate management?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GOOGL reported a provision for income taxes of $11,922 million, a slight increase from $11,356 million in 2022, reflecting relatively stable tax planning strategies despite large deferred tax benefits. META showed a significant increase in its provision for income taxes, rising to $8,330 million in 2023 from $5,619 million in 2022, a 48% increase, which suggests a shift in earnings or tax jurisdiction mix. NFLX had the lowest effective tax rate at 13% in 2023, with a provision for income taxes of $797.4 million, showing a gradual upward trend from $772.0 million in 2022, indicating effective use of international tax structures and credits. These differences highlight varying approaches to managing tax liabilities, with NFLX leveraging international deductions and credits more effectively, while META experienced a notable tax increase tied to its operational performance.",

      "question": "How do DIS, GOOGL, and VZ each characterize their interest on lease liabilities in relation to their broader lease cost structures, and what does this reveal about their financing strategies in the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "DIS reports interest on lease liabilities at $13 million in 2024, which constitutes a small portion of its total lease cost of $1,530 million. GOOGL's interest on lease liabilities decreased to $31 million in 2024, reflecting a declining trend over the past three years, while its total lease cost rose to $5,173 million. VZ's interest on lease liabilities increased significantly to $98 million in 2024, representing a growing share of its total lease cost of $6,149 million. This comparison indicates that DIS maintains a low reliance on finance leases, GOOGL is reducing its finance lease burden despite rising overall lease costs, and VZ is increasingly dependent on finance leases, signaling distinct financing strategies among the companies.",

      "answer": "CMCSA reports $2.0 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits that would directly impact its effective tax rate if recognized, while GOOGL maintains a significant valuation allowance against its federal and state tax credits, including $600 million in federal R&D credits and $6.3 billion in California R&D credits. META discloses $11.67 billion in gross unrecognized tax benefits, primarily tied to transfer pricing with foreign subsidiaries, with a potential $7.33 billion tax benefit upon resolution. These figures highlight varying degrees of tax exposure and strategic positioning, with META facing the most significant uncertain tax liability, largely due to international transfer pricing disputes, while GOOGL's exposure is more credit-dependent and CMCSA's is more modest and rate-sensitive.",

      "answer": "CMCSA emphasizes its fiber-based broadband services with symmetrical speeds up to 100 gigabits per second, targeting both residential and enterprise customers, and integrates broadband with streaming services like NOW TV, which is only available to qualifying broadband subscribers. AT&T (T) reports 14,079 thousand total broadband and DSL connections in 2024, with fiber broadband connections growing by 12.3% year-over-year to 9,331 thousand, indicating a strong shift toward fiber-based infrastructure. Verizon (VZ) reports approximately 10 million total broadband connections (including Fios, FWA, and DSL) in its Consumer segment and 2 million in its Business segment, with a strategic emphasis on 5G/4G-based fixed wireless access as a competitive alternative to traditional landline broadband. The synthesis reveals that CMCSA is leveraging broadband as a gateway to bundled streaming and platform services, AT&T is prioritizing fiber expansion with significant growth in fiber connections, and Verizon is balancing fiber (Fios) with aggressive deployment of FWA leveraging its wireless network leadership.",

X1 and Sky Q are cloud-based platforms that provide integrated search functionality leveraging set-top boxes and voice-activated remote controls. The integrated features operate across content in customers' video service packages and content from internet-based streaming services that customers may access in a manner similar to our Xumo Stream Box. We offer a range of video packages from basic linear service to full linear service, which typically include free-to-air networks and a range of other linear television networks including premium, sports and news networks. Our international video packages also include Sky-branded entertainment television networks that offer entertainment, premium movie and free-to-air programming, as well as Sky Sports networks that are part of our Media segment. Customers may also subscribe to digital video recorder ('DVR') services or access our video on demand services with programming that is available for no additional cost or to rent or buy digitally. These viewing options are also available through our mobile apps and online portals.\n\nWe also offer DTC streaming services marketed under the NOW brand, with an offering in the United States that launched in 2023. NOW services provide video content over the internet and do not require a set-top box. Our international NOW service offerings include packages for monthly access to entertainment, sports and movie programming, as well as daily pass options for sports programming.  Our domestic  NOW  TV  service is only offered to qualifying residential broadband customers  and  includes  monthly  access  to  a  variety  of  linear  television  networks;  entertainment  and  movie  programming;  integrated  access  to  free  streaming channels from Xumo Play, NBC and Sky; and access to the ad-supported tier of Peacock.\n\nWe also offer video services in the United Kingdom and Italy over a broadband connection without the need for a satellite dish. These services have an operating system similar to Sky Q and are offered to customers through Sky Stream, which leverages a streaming device and Wi-Fi, or to customers that purchase our Sky G lass smart televisions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nAs part of our distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells, and we also sell advertising on our Sky-branded entertainment television networks and on our digital platforms. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties both domestically and internationally. Additionally, we offer technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nWe offer residential wireline voice services primarily using interconnected V oice over Internet Protocol ('V oIP') technology, and we offer residential security and automation  services.  We  also  license  our  technology  platforms  to  other  multichannel  video  providers  and  distribute  certain  of  our  Sky-branded  entertainment television networks to third-party video service providers.\n\n## Business Services Connectivity Segment\n\nOur Business Services Connectivity segment consists of our domestic service offerings for small businesses, which include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services, as well as our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises. Certain business customers subscribe to our video services, and the associated revenue is included in our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segment. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nOur domestic broadband offerings have a range of service levels, including fiber-based services that deliver symmetrical speeds ranging up to 100 gigabits per second.\n\nOur small business broadband, wireline voice and wireless service offerings are similar to those provided to our residential customers and also include cloud-based cybersecurity services, wireless backup connectivity, advanced Wi-Fi solutions, video monitoring services and other cloud-based services.\n\nOur enterprise solutions offerings also include ethernet network services, which connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options, advanced voice services, and a software-defined networking product. Larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services.  These services are primarily provided to  Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations both within and outside of our distribution footprint, where we provide coverage outside of our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

(the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries (together with the Company , collectively , V erizon), is one of the world's leading providers of communications, technology , information and streaming products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers' demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity and security.\n\nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - V erizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and V erizon Business Group (Business).\n\n## Verizon Consumer Group\n\nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the V erizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA ) broadband through our fifth-generation (5G) or fourth-generation (4G) Long-T erm Evolution (LTE) networks as an alternative  to  traditional  landline  internet  access.  Our  wireline  serv ices  are  prov ided  in  nine  states  in  the  M id-A tlantic  and  Northeastern  U.S.,  as  well  as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our V erizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.\n\nIn 2024, the Consumer segment's revenues were $102.9 billion, representing approximately 76% of V erizon's consolidated revenues.

In addition, at December 31, 2024, Consumer had approximately 10 million total broadband connections (which includes Fios internet, FWA  and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) connections), and approximately 3 million Fios video connections.\n\n## Verizon Business Group\n\nOur  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including  FWA   broadband,  data,  video  and  advanced communication services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world.\n\nIn 2024, the Business segment's revenues were $29.5 billion, representing approximately 22% of V erizon's consolidated revenues.

As of December 31, 2024, we had 95 million postpaid connections and 20 million prepaid connections, representing approximately 83% and 17% of our Consumer wireless retail connections, respectively.",

      "answer": "GOOGL's effective tax rate fluctuated from 15.9% in 2022 to 13.9% in 2023 before rising to 16.4% in 2024, reflecting changes in foreign-derived intangible income deductions and research credits. META saw a notable decline in its effective tax rate from 19% in 2022 to 18% in 2023, then a significant drop to 12% in 2024, indicating potential tax planning optimizations or changes in geographic profit allocation. NFLX's effective tax rate remained stable at 13% in both 2023 and 2024, down from 15% in 2022, suggesting consistent tax management despite increasing tax provisions. These patterns reveal differing dynamics: GOOGL shows volatility tied to deductions, META demonstrates a strategic downward trend, and NFLX maintains stability despite growth.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Google (GOOGL) reported total liabilities of $119.0 billion and stockholders' equity of $283.4 billion, indicating a strong equity position relative to liabilities. Meta (META) had total liabilities of $76.5 billion and stockholders' equity of $153.2 billion, showing a similar but smaller equity cushion. AT&T (T), on the other hand, had significantly higher liabilities at $289.6 billion (including $127.9 billion in long-term debt) and stockholders' equity of $117.4 billion, suggesting a more leveraged financial structure. These differences reflect GOOGL and META's capital-light strategies with strong retained earnings, while T's higher liabilities reflect its capital-intensive telecom infrastructure and legacy obligations.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, GOOGL, and META differ in their accounting treatment of sales commissions, particularly in terms of deferral and recognition periods, and what does this reveal about their respective business models?",
      "answer": "CMCSA generally expenses sales commissions as incurred for customers not under contract, while deferring and recognizing commissions over contract terms for international customers under contracts typically ranging up to 18 months. GOOGL expenses sales commissions immediately when the expected benefit period is one year or less, and capitalizes and amortizes them when the benefit period exceeds one year, reflecting a more nuanced approach tied to contract duration. META consistently expenses sales commissions when incurred, citing that the amortization period is one year or less, aligning with a short-term customer engagement model. These differences suggest that CMCSA and GOOGL have more structured, contract-based customer relationships with longer-term value, while META's model is more transactional and short-term in nature.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Sales Commissions: CMCSA expenses commissions as incurred for non-contract customers and defers them over contract terms (up to 18 months) for international contract customers.",

      "question": "How do Disney (DIS), AT&T (T), and Verizon (VZ) differ in their 2024 contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies for managing long-term employee obligations?",
      "answer": "Disney (DIS) contributed $69 million to pension plans and $26 million to postretirement medical plans in 2024, indicating a modest but consistent funding approach. In contrast, AT&T (T) made only $3 million in pension contributions and no contributions to postretirement benefits, suggesting a more constrained or strategic delay in funding. Verizon (VZ) did not disclose specific contribution figures but emphasized rigorous actuarial review and audit controls over benefit obligations, pointing to a process-driven and potentially conservative approach. Collectively, these differences reflect varied strategies: DIS maintains steady contributions, T appears to minimize near-term outflows, and VZ focuses on precision in obligation measurement and audit rigor.",

New York, New York\n\nFebruary 12, 2025\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the employee benefits obligation valuation process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the employee benefit obligation calculations, the actuarial assumption relating to the discount rates and the data inputs provided to the actuary.\n\nTo test the employee benefit obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used, the actuarial assumption relating to the discount rates and the underlying data used by the Company . We compared the actuarial assumption used by management to historical trends, current economic factors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management's methodology for determining the discount rates that reflect the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and are used to measure the employee benefit obligations. A s part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data.",

This indicates a strategic focus on funding content creation as a core long-term investment.

In contrast, VZ capitalized $1,818 million in interest costs in 2023, showing a significant investment in capital projects, likely tied to its infrastructure and network development.

      "answer": "Meta reports that its operating lease obligations primarily include offices, data centers, and colocations, and while affected by facilities consolidation, these obligations were not materially changed. Netflix discloses operating lease obligations totaling $3.09 billion, with $513.5 million due in the next 12 months and $2.58 billion beyond that. Verizon reports significantly larger operating lease obligations of $28.4 billion, with $4.8 billion due in the next year. These differences reflect Meta's asset-light infrastructure strategy, Netflix's moderate reliance on leased assets, and Verizon's capital-intensive network and infrastructure operations.",

      "question": "How do DIS, META, and VZ each break down their finance lease costs, and what does this reveal about their relative reliance on leased assets and associated interest expenses?",
      "answer": "DIS reports a finance lease cost breakdown of $36 million for amortization of right-of-use assets and $13 million for interest on lease liabilities in 2024. META discloses significantly higher figures, with $387 million in amortization and $23 million in interest for the same period. VZ, meanwhile, reports $329 million in amortization and $98 million in interest on lease liabilities in 2024. The comparative analysis reveals that VZ bears a much larger interest burden relative to DIS and META, suggesting a higher cost of financing leased assets, while META\u2019s significantly higher amortization reflects a larger base of leased assets. DIS maintains the lowest finance lease cost profile overall, indicating a relatively lighter reliance on leased assets.",

      "answer": "DIS reports $549 million in produced and licensed content costs, reflecting its investment in content for Disney+ and other streaming platforms. META discloses that content costs are a component of its cost of revenue, particularly for licensed video and music aimed at increasing platform engagement, though no specific dollar amount is provided. NFLX highlights rising content costs as a competitive risk, noting that increasing competition is driving up programming expenses and impacting its ability to maintain a cost-efficient content mix. Together, these perspectives show that DIS treats content costs as a major line item tied to its streaming ambitions, META integrates content costs into broader platform operations, and NFLX views content costs as a growing external threat to profitability and strategic differentiation.",

      "answer": "CMCSA reports that eliminations are primarily driven by content licensing transactions between its Studios and Media segments within the Content & Experiences business, with changes depending on the timing of content license recognition. DIS discloses a fixed elimination value of $1,595 million in 2024, specifically tied to its Entertainment and Sports segments under regional reporting, indicating a consistent internal transaction pattern. VZ shows a relatively small and stable elimination value of $253 million in 2023, consistent with prior years, suggesting minimal intersegment activity relative to overall revenue. The differences in scale and variability of eliminations reflect distinct internal operational structures and interdependence across business units.",

NFLX highlights its limited experience with advertising and outlines risks such as advertiser retention, member dissatisfaction with ads, and the need for improved measurement tools to demonstrate ad effectiveness.

      "answer": "CMCSA reported an increase in domestic revenue in 2024, primarily driven by growth in domestic distribution and the impact of the Paris Olympics. DIS disclosed that its ESPN segment generated $3,763 million in domestic revenue, reflecting a 10% year-over-year increase. VZ reported $21,253 million in domestic revenue for 2024, showing a significant rise from $15,668 million in 2023. Together, these figures indicate varying degrees of domestic market strength, with DIS showing double-digit growth in a key segment, CMCSA benefiting from event-driven revenue, and VZ demonstrating a substantial rebound in domestic revenue performance.",

We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.\n\n## Leases and Contractual Commitments\n\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include data centers, offices and colocations. Our finance lease obligations include certain network infrastructure. Our facilities  consolidation  restructuring  efforts  did  not  materially  change  our  operating  lease  obligations.  Our  contractual  commitments  are  primarily  related  to  our investments in servers and network infrastructure, and content costs from content providers whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion, which mature  from  2027  through  2064.  Short-term  and  long-term  future  interest  payments  obligations  as  of  December  31,  2024  were  $1.39  billion  and  $28.10  billion, respectively.\n\n## Capital Return Program\n\n## Share Repurchase\n\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 65 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $29.75 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $51.28 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.\n\n## Dividend\n\nWe paid four quarterly cash dividends, including dividend equivalents, totaling $2.00 for each share of Class A and Class B common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. Total dividends and dividend equivalents paid were $5.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. Subject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend and dividend equivalents on our outstanding common stock.\n\n## Taxes\n\nCash paid for income taxes was $10.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had taxes payable of $718 million related to a one-time transition tax  payable incurred as a result of the Tax  Act, which is due within one year.\n\nOur long-term income taxes include $9.99 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.",

      "question": "How do DIS, GOOGL, and META each explain the factors influencing their 2023 effective tax rates, and what does this reveal about their respective global tax strategies?",
      "answer": "DIS reported an effective tax rate of 23.7% for 2023, driven by non-tax deductible impairments (8.8%) and foreign-derived intangible income deductions (-3.6%). GOOGL had a lower effective tax rate of 13.9% in 2023, primarily due to foreign-derived intangible income deductions (-4.6%) and federal research credits (-1.8%). META's effective tax rate was 18% in 2023, with no detailed breakdown of specific components, but a notable 48% year-over-year increase in its tax provision. These differences suggest that while all three companies operate in the same sector, they experience varying tax impacts based on their international operations, R&D investments, and impairment strategies.",

      "answer": "CMCSA generates revenue from subscribers through both advertising and per-subscriber distribution fees for its linear TV networks and streaming services like Peacock. DIS reports unique subscriber counts across its international general entertainment and family channels, indicating a focus on content licensing and distribution deals. T, on the other hand, highlights fiber broadband and wireless subscriber growth in the U.S. and Mexico, emphasizing infrastructure investment rather than content monetization. Together, this reveals that while all three companies rely on subscribers, they do so through distinct business models: CMCSA through content distribution and advertising, DIS through content licensing and channel reach, and T through connectivity services.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and NFLX each describe the impact of declining advertising revenue on their respective business models, and what does this reveal about their strategic positioning in the evolving media landscape?",
      "answer": "CMCSA notes that declines in advertising expenditures, particularly on traditional linear television and Peacock, negatively impact their results of operations. They cite audience fragmentation, time-shifting technologies, and advertiser shifts to digital platforms as key drivers of this decline. DIS highlights that advertising revenue is sensitive to U.S. and global economic conditions, with downturns reducing guest spending at parks and advertising purchases on their platforms. They also note regulatory and content localization costs as challenges. NFLX, while still building out its ad-supported tier, acknowledges uncertainty in growing advertising revenue due to limited operating history, competition for ad spend, and risks related to measurement tools, privacy regulations, and member dissatisfaction with ads. Collectively, these perspectives show CMCSA grappling with structural shifts in media consumption, DIS facing macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds, and NFLX navigating early-stage ad monetization challenges.",

      "question": "How do DIS, T, and VZ each report their finance lease cost components, and what does this reveal about their relative reliance on financed assets and associated interest burdens in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2024, DIS reported a total finance lease cost of $1,530 million, with $36 million attributed to amortization and $13 million to interest. T reported a total finance lease cost of $376 million, with $205 million in amortization and $171 million in interest. VZ reported a total finance lease cost of $6,149 million, with $329 million in amortization and $98 million in interest. This indicates that VZ has the highest overall reliance on financed assets, followed by T and then DIS. However, T bears the highest proportion of interest costs relative to amortization, suggesting a more debt-intensive financing structure compared to DIS and VZ.",

DIS disclosed $0.4 billion in severance charges during fiscal 2023, reflecting ongoing restructuring efforts, particularly in response to strategic content and international business changes. GOOGL explicitly detailed severance charges tied to involuntary employee terminations, with liabilities tracked and reported in millions, and noted that these costs were largely accounted for at the Alphabet corporate level. Together, these disclosures suggest varying degrees of workforce optimization and cost discipline across the three companies in the face of shifting market dynamics.",

      "answer": "CMCSA reduced overall programming and production costs in 2023 due to lower entertainment content costs and the impact of industry work stoppages, though Peacock and international sports programming costs increased. META incurred content costs primarily through licensing video and music from third-party providers, expensing these costs when titles are accepted for viewing or over the license period. NFLX highlighted rising programming costs due to competition and exclusivity demands, noting that increased content provider leverage and licensing challenges are negatively impacting cost efficiency and service differentiation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Content Costs: Programming and production costs decreased in 2023 due to reduced entertainment content costs and the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages, though Peacock and international sports programming costs rose, including shifts in FIFA World Cup-related expenses.",
        "Hop 2: META \u2192 Content Costs: META incurs content costs by licensing video and music from providers, expensing them either when titles are accepted for viewing or over the contractual license period, with most video and music costs expensed immediately.",
        "Hop 3: NFLX \u2192 Content Costs: NFLX reported that rising content costs are driven by competition, exclusivity demands, and challenges in securing favorable licensing terms, with studios increasingly unwilling to license popular content, leading to higher costs and potential service disruptions."

      "question": "How do CMCSA, NFLX, and VZ each manage or report on their direct costs, and what does this reveal about their respective cost structures and operational strategies in the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "CMCSA reports that its Connectivity & Platforms segments use shared infrastructure, and each segment is presented with its direct costs and an allocation of shared costs. This indicates a cost structure that relies on centralized infrastructure with segmented cost attribution. NFLX highlights that payments for content assets decreased significantly from $16,660 million in 2022 to $13,140 million in 2023, showing a strategic shift toward managing content-related direct costs amid increased cash flow. VZ notes a decrease in direct costs by $156 million in 2023, primarily related to professional services that did not reoccur, suggesting a focus on trimming non-essential direct expenses. Together, these approaches reveal distinct operational strategies: CMCSA emphasizes cost allocation across shared platforms, NFLX focuses on optimizing content spending, and VZ prioritizes reducing professional service costs to improve efficiency.",

AT&T (T) uses its Segment Results section to provide detailed analysis of its operating performance and guides future revenue and expense trends for 2024, suggesting a forward-looking and segment-driven financial strategy. Verizon (VZ) attributes its consolidated operating revenue decline to decreases in Wireless equipment revenues and discusses each segment's performance separately, emphasizing transparency in segment-specific performance drivers.

      "answer": "Disney (DIS) emphasizes that content availability is subject to risks such as health concerns, production delays, and competition for content creation and acquisition, which could affect the performance of its content and profitability. Netflix (NFLX) specifically highlights the increasing cost and uncertainty of licensing content from third-party rights holders, noting that studios developing their own streaming services may withhold popular content, directly impacting Netflix\u2019s ability to offer a compelling content mix. AT&T (T) points to regulatory and legal risks, particularly from FCC decisions regarding spectrum use and content licensing, which could affect WarnerMedia\u2019s ability to deliver programming and compete effectively. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face challenges tied to content availability, Disney is more concerned with production and health-related disruptions, Netflix is focused on rising licensing costs and exclusivity battles, and AT&T highlights regulatory constraints and spectrum availability as key risks.",

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance and may include statements concerning, among other things, financial results, business plans (including statements regarding new services and products and future expenditures, costs and investments), future liabilities, impairments and amortization, competition, and the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses and results of operations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as 'may,' 'will,' 'would,' 'should,' 'expects,' 'plans,' 'could,' 'intends,' 'target,' 'projects,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'anticipates,' 'potential' or 'continue' or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions as of the date of this report. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations or results projected or implied by forward-looking statements.\n\nSuch differences may result from actions taken by the Company, including restructuring or strategic initiatives (including capital investments, asset acquisitions or dispositions, new or expanded business lines or cessation of certain operations), our execution of our business plans (including the content we create and IP we invest in, our pricing decisions and our cost structure) or other business decisions, as well as from developments beyond the Company's control, including:\n\n- further deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions;\n- deterioration in or pressures from competitive conditions, including competition to create or acquire content;\n- consumer preferences and acceptance of our content, offerings, pricing model and price increases and the market for advertising sales on our direct-to-consumer services and linear networks;\n- health concerns and their impact on our businesses and productions;\n- international, regulatory, legal, political, or military developments;\n- technological developments;\n- labor markets and activities;\n- adverse weather conditions or natural disasters; and\n- availability of content;\n\neach such risk includes the current and future impacts of, and is amplified by, COVID-19 and related mitigation efforts.\n\nSuch developments may further affect entertainment, travel and leisure businesses generally and may, among other things, affect (or further affect, as applicable):\n\n- our operations, business plans or profitability;\n- demand for our products and services;\n- the performance of the Company's content;\n- our ability to create or obtain desirable content at or under the value we assign the content;\n- the advertising market for programming;\n- income tax expense; and\n- performance of some or all Company businesses either directly or through their impact on those who distribute our products.\n\nAdditional factors include those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the captions 'Risk Factors,' 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' and 'Business,' in our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including under the captions 'Risk Factors' and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nA forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances. You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. Unless required by federal securities laws, we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statements are made.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

Many of these factors are discussed in more detail in the 'Risk Factors' section. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\nThe following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements:\n\n- The severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and containment, mitigation and other measures taken in response, including the potential impacts of these matters on our business and operations.\n- Our inability to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts will continue to impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\n- Adverse economic, political and/or capital access changes in the markets served by us or in countries in which we have significant investments and/or operations, including the impact on customer demand and our ability and our suppliers' ability to access financial markets at favorable rates and terms.\n- Increases in our benefit plans' costs, including increases due to adverse changes in the United States and foreign securities markets, resulting in worse-than-assumed investment returns and discount rates; adverse changes in mortality assumptions; adverse medical cost trends; and unfavorable or delayed implementation or repeal of healthcare legislation, regulations or related court decisions.\n- The final outcome of FCC and other federal, state or foreign government agency proceedings (including judicial review, if any, of such proceedings) and legislative efforts involving issues that are important to our business, including, without limitation, pending Notices of Apparent Liability; the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, including the withdrawal of legacy TDM-based services; universal service; broadband deployment; wireless equipment siting regulations and, in particular, siting for 5G service; E911 services; competition policy; privacy; net neutrality; multichannel video programming distributor services and equipment; content licensing and copyright protection; availability of new spectrum on fair and balanced terms; and wireless and satellite license awards and renewals.\n- Enactment of additional state, local, federal and/or foreign regulatory and tax laws and regulations, or changes to existing standards and actions by tax agencies and judicial authorities including the resolution of disputes with any taxing jurisdictions, pertaining to our subsidiaries and foreign investments, including laws and regulations that reduce our incentive to invest in our networks, resulting in lower revenue growth and/or higher operating costs.\n- Potential changes to the electromagnetic spectrum currently used for broadcast television and satellite distribution being considered by the FCC could negatively impact WarnerMedia's ability to deliver linear network feeds of its domestic cable networks to its affiliates, and in some cases, WarnerMedia's ability to produce high-value news and entertainment programming on location.\n- U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding intellectual property rights protection and privacy, personal data protection and user consent are complex and rapidly evolving and could result in adverse impacts to our business plans, increased costs, or claims against us that may harm our reputation.\n- The ability of our competitors to offer product/service offerings at lower prices due to lower cost structures and regulatory and legislative actions adverse to us, including non-regulation of comparable alternative technologies and/or government-owned or subsidized networks.\n- Disruption in our supply chain for a number of reasons, including, difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, inability to secure component parts, general business disruption, workforce shortage, natural disasters, safety issues, economic and political instability and public health emergencies.\n- The continued development and delivery of attractive and profitable wireless, video content and broadband offerings and devices, and, in particular, the success of our HBO Max platform; the extent to which regulatory and build-out requirements apply to our offerings; our ability to match speeds offered by our competitors and the availability, cost and/or reliability of the various technologies and/or content required to provide such offerings.\n- Our ability to generate subscription and advertising revenue from attractive video content, especially from WarnerMedia, in the face of unpredictable and rapidly evolving public viewing habits and legal restrictions on using personal data for advertising.\n- The availability and cost and our ability to adequately fund additional wireless spectrum and network upgrades; and regulations and conditions relating to spectrum use, licensing, obtaining additional spectrum, technical standards and deployment and usage, including network management rules.\n- Our ability to manage growth in wireless data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms.\n- The outcome of pending, threatened or potential litigation (which includes arbitrations), including, without limitation, patent and product safety claims by or against third parties or claims based on alleged misconduct by employees.",

      "answer": "Disney (DIS) reports that its total accumulated pension benefit obligations were $15.7 billion as of September 28, 2024, with 98% of these benefits being vested. AT&T (T) highlights changes in benefit obligations recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), showing an after-tax impact of pension obligations on OCI.

Netflix, while not currently a major advertising-driven platform, explicitly mentions advertising as a forward-looking area of focus and a potential lever for growth, particularly through its ad-supported subscription plan.

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or publicly release any revision to any such forward-looking statement, except as may otherwise be required by law.\n\n## Item 1. Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix , Inc. ('Netflix ', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approx imately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We aim to offer a range of pricing plans, including our ad-supported subscription plan, to meet a variety of consumer needs. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers' leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\n\n## SEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.",

Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or  permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.\n\nThe tax years 2014 through 2020 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\n\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\n\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However,  the  outcome  of  tax  audits  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are resolved in  a  manner  not  consistent  with  management's  expectations,  we  could  be  required  to  adjust  our  provision  for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  our  unrecognized  tax  benefits  from  certain  U.S.  federal,  state  and  non  U.S.  tax positions  could  decrease  by  approximately  $2.0  billion  in  the  next  12  months.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\n\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\n- Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and inapp purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n- Google Cloud includes Google's infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace collaboration tools and other enterprise services.\n- Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.",

On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2021 the valuation allowance of $318 million was related to the California research and development credits and certain foreign tax attributes that we do not expect to realize.\n\nWe did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2021, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $203 million of which $136 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption 'Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nAt December 31, 2021, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $15.5 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2022 and 2030. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in",

      "answer": "Disney expects advertising revenue growth in sports and entertainment to offset declines from linear network subscribers, despite ongoing viewership reductions. Google, which generates over 75% of its total revenue from online advertising, faces risks from reduced advertiser spending and evolving regulations that could limit its ability to personalize ads. Meta's advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by regulatory changes such as GDPR and iOS updates, which restrict data signals used for targeting and measurement, leading to less effective ad delivery. Together, these perspectives highlight a sector-wide challenge: while digital advertising remains a core revenue driver, companies are navigating distinct yet converging pressures\u2014ranging from content investment strategies to regulatory and platform-level constraints\u2014that shape their monetization approaches.",

There were no dividends paid or share repurchases in fiscal 2023. The Company is targeting a total of $3 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe Company may be required to pay an incremental amount for Hulu depending on a final determination of Hulu's fair value. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the transactions with noncontrolling interest holders.\n\nThe Company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control. We believe that the Company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, contractual obligations, upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital ex penditures related to the ex pansion of ex isting businesses and development of new projects. In addition, the Company could undertake other measures to ensure sufficient liquidity, such as raising additional financing, reducing or not declaring future dividends; reducing or stopping share repurchases; reducing capital spending; reducing film and episodic content investments; or implementing further cost-saving initiatives.\n\nThe Company's borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of September 28, 2024, Moody's Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, S&amp;P Global Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. The Company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, tax es, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On September 28, 2024, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The Company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.\n\n## DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS\n\n## Star India Transaction\n\nThe Company and RIL plan to close a transaction on or about November 14, 2024, which will form a joint venture that combines our Star-branded and other general entertainment and sports television channels and Disney+ Hotstar service in India (Star India) and certain media and entertainment businesses of RIL (see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). The Company will have a 37% interest in the joint venture. The Company has consolidated, and will continue to consolidate, the income statement and cash flow activities of Star India through the closing date, at which time the Company will recognize on its balance sheet the 37% investment at fair value. In addition, the Company will begin recognizing its proportional share of the joint venture's results in 'Equity in the income of investees, net' in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The equity earnings of the joint venture will not be reported in our segments' operating results.\n\n## Trends\n\nTo drive growth at our sports and entertainment businesses, we are, among other things, making strategic investments in our DTC offerings. Although there can be no assurances these investments will be successful, we expect that they will lead to growth in subscription fees and advertising revenues that will more than offset impacts on affiliate fees and advertising revenue from declines in linear network subscribers and the related decrease in average viewership, which we expect will continue.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs\n\nWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\nProduction costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",

For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, including the CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Other U.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing additional rights for users and could result in restrictions  on  our  use  of  signals  from  third-party  apps  and  websites  through  certain  browser-  and  device-based  universal  opt-out  mechanisms.  Judicial  and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings.\n\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and G oogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\n\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021.  If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\n\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\n\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to",

      "answer": "CMCSA reported $3,969 million in advertising revenue in 2023, showing a decline from previous years, suggesting a reduced emphasis on advertising as a core revenue stream. DIS, in contrast, reported $13,048 million in advertising revenue across its Entertainment, Sports, and Other segments, indicating a stronger reliance on advertising as part of its diversified media strategy. NFLX, while not disclosing specific advertising revenue figures, highlighted advertising as a forward-looking area of strategic interest, signaling a potential shift toward incorporating ad-supported models in its streaming platform. Together, these perspectives reveal CMCSA de-emphasizing ads, DIS leveraging them across multiple platforms, and NFLX exploring their integration as part of future growth strategies.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Advertising: CMCSA disclosed $3,969 million in advertising revenue in 2023, down from $4,546 million in 2022, indicating a declining trend and potentially a strategic pivot away from advertising.",

        "Hop 3: NFLX \u2192 Advertising: NFLX did not report specific advertising revenue figures but mentioned advertising in its forward-looking statements, indicating strategic exploration of ad-supported models as part of its evolving business approach."

DIS notes that rising competition to create or acquire content poses a risk to its business plans and content value proposition. NFLX, on the other hand, emphasizes its ongoing strategy to significantly increase investments in global content, particularly original content, and anticipates that cash flows and financing will support these needs.

The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations, channels, or digital platforms. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, online media and other digital sources. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur television and streaming platforms compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other cable, broadcast and premium networks, DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, and local broadcast television stations. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost is significant.\n\nOur  cable  networks  compete  with  other  cable  networks  and  programming  providers  for  carriage  of  their  programming  by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. Our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences for our film and television content with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position  of  our  film  and  television  studios  primarily  depends  on  the  number  of  films  and  shows  and  episodes  produced,  their distribution  and  marketing  success,  and  consumer  response.  Our  film  and  television  studios  also  compete  to  obtain  creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on premium networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nTheme Parks competes with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and  recreational  activities.  To  help  maintain  the  competitiveness  of  our  theme  parks,  we  have  invested  and  continue  to  invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including the new theme parks in Beijing and Orlando.\n\n## Sky Segment\n\nSky is one of Europe's leading entertainment companies operating in six territories, including three of the largest pay television markets in Western Europe: the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. The majority of our revenue is derived from our direct-toconsumer business, which has 23.0 million customer relationships, and primarily involves the distribution of a wide array of video channels  to  both  residential  and  business  customers.  We  also  offer  broadband,  voice  and  wireless  services  individually  and  as bundled services in select countries. We own a diverse portfolio of pay television channels that feature entertainment, news, sports and movies, which are included in our subscription video services and are also licensed through various distribution partnerships to third-party video providers to reach an additional 3 million households. We also generate revenue from the licensing of owned and licensed programming to third-party video providers and from the sale of advertising.\n\n## Direct-to-Consumer\n\n## Video\n\nOur  direct-to-home  ('DTH')  video  services  are  delivered  primarily  through  a  combination  of  both  satellite  transmission  and broadband connections that are marketed under the Sky brand in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Austria.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance and may include statements concerning, among other things, financial results, business plans (including statements regarding new services and products and future expenditures, costs and investments), future liabilities, impairments and amortization, competition, and the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses and results of operations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as 'may,' 'will,' 'would,' 'should,' 'expects,' 'plans,' 'could,' 'intends,' 'target,' 'projects,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'anticipates,' 'potential' or 'continue' or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions as of the date of this report. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations or results projected or implied by forward-looking statements.\n\nSuch differences may result from actions taken by the Company, including restructuring or strategic initiatives (including capital investments, asset acquisitions or dispositions, new or expanded business lines or cessation of certain operations), our execution of our business plans (including the content we create and IP we invest in, our pricing decisions and our cost structure) or other business decisions, as well as from developments beyond the Company's control, including:\n\n- further deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions;\n- deterioration in or pressures from competitive conditions, including competition to create or acquire content;\n- consumer preferences and acceptance of our content, offerings, pricing model and price increases and the market for advertising sales on our direct-to-consumer services and linear networks;\n- health concerns and their impact on our businesses and productions;\n- international, regulatory, legal, political, or military developments;\n- technological developments;\n- labor markets and activities;\n- adverse weather conditions or natural disasters; and\n- availability of content;\n\neach such risk includes the current and future impacts of, and is amplified by, COVID-19 and related mitigation efforts.\n\nSuch developments may further affect entertainment, travel and leisure businesses generally and may, among other things, affect (or further affect, as applicable):\n\n- our operations, business plans or profitability;\n- demand for our products and services;\n- the performance of the Company's content;\n- our ability to create or obtain desirable content at or under the value we assign the content;\n- the advertising market for programming;\n- income tax expense; and\n- performance of some or all Company businesses either directly or through their impact on those who distribute our products.\n\nAdditional factors include those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the captions 'Risk Factors,' 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' and 'Business,' in our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including under the captions 'Risk Factors' and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nA forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances. You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. Unless required by federal securities laws, we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statements are made.",

The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $1,408 million. The amount of principal and interest due beyond the next twelve months is $18,638 million. As of December 31, 2021, no amounts had been borrowed under our $1 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased 1,182,410 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million. As of December 31, 2021, $4.4 billion remains available for repurchases.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content are in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly in original content. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. Expected timing of those payments are as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "CMCSA reported an increase in domestic revenue in 2024, driven by growth in domestic distribution and international networks revenue, with a notable contribution from the Paris Olympics. GOOGL disclosed a significant rise in domestic revenue, reaching $108,076 million in 2024, up from $73,600 million in 2023, indicating strong growth in its core advertising and cloud services. VZ also reported a rise in domestic revenue, increasing to $21,253 million in 2024 from $15,668 million in 2023, signaling recovery or expansion in its U.S. telecom services.

      "answer": "In 2024, DIS reported a total lease cost of $1,530 million, reflecting a steady increase from $1,318 million in 2023. GOOGL experienced a rise in total lease cost to $5,173 million in 2024 from $5,048 million in 2023, despite a decline in finance lease costs. META showed a significant increase in total lease cost to $3,613 million in 2024 from $3,040 million in 2023, driven by higher variable lease costs. These trends suggest differing approaches: DIS maintains controlled growth, GOOGL optimizes finance leases while managing operational costs, and META aggressively expands infrastructure.",

GOOGL shows a negative value of ($5,237 million) for Property and Equipment, net, suggesting that its deferred tax liabilities related to these assets exceed the book value, which may reflect aggressive tax planning or high depreciation allowances tied to large-scale data centers and technology investments. NFLX reports Property and Equipment, net at $1.323 billion, significantly lower than the other two firms, consistent with its primarily digital streaming model that requires less physical infrastructure. Together, these figures highlight differing capital strategies: CMCSA is heavily asset-intensive, GOOGL manages asset value through tax-optimized depreciation, and NFLX minimizes physical asset investment in favor of scalable digital infrastructure.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and VZ each quantify and contextualize their severance charges in 2024, and what do these differences reveal about their respective cost management strategies in the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "CMCSA notes that expenses in 2024 decreased due to higher severance charges in 2023, implying a reduction in restructuring activity compared to the prior year. DIS recorded $0.1 billion in severance charges in 2024, a decrease from $0.4 billion in 2023, indicating a scaling back of workforce-related restructuring costs. VZ reported $1,733 million in severance charges in 2024, a significant increase from $533 million in 2023, suggesting a more aggressive restructuring effort. These variations highlight differing approaches to cost optimization, with VZ undertaking the most substantial workforce adjustments, DIS moderating its restructuring, and CMCSA experiencing a decline in severance-related costs.",

As a result, we evaluated the residual goodwill at our entertainment DTC services and linear networks reporting units for impairment. Star sports was a standalone reporting unit which did not have any goodwill.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test as part of our annual goodwill impairment assessment.\n\nThese evaluations resulted in non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion at our entertainment linear networks reporting unit in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, respectively. Goodwill was not impaired at the entertainment DTC services reporting unit.\n\nIn addition, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment assessment in fiscal 2023, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to our entertainment and international sports linear networks reporting units of $0.7 billion.\n\n## Content\n\nWe recorded charges of $0.2 billion and $2.6 billion, in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively, as a result of our strategic changes in approach to content curation. The fiscal 2024 charges related to the removal of produced content from our entertainment linear networks and DTC services. The fiscal 2023 charges included $2.0 billion related to the removal of produced content from our entertainment DTC services and $0.6 billion related to the termination of certain third-party license agreements for the right to use content primarily on our entertainment DTC services. We paid approximately $0.4 billion of cash to terminate these license agreements.\n\n## Other\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company recorded charges of $0.3 billion for asset impairments at our retail business, $0.2 billion for impairments of equity investments and $0.1 billion of severance. In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded charges of $0.4 billion of severance, $0.1 billion for impairment of an equity investment and $0.1 billion for ex iting our businesses in Russia. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded charges of $0.2 billion, primarily due to asset impairments related to ex iting our businesses in Russia.\n\n## 19 New Accounting Pronouncements and Other Disclosure Rules\n\n## Improvements to Reportable Segments Disclosures\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to enhance reportable segment disclosures by requiring the disclosure of significant ex penses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included in the segment's measure of profit or loss. It also requires an explanation of how the CODM uses the segment's measure of profit or loss to assess segment performance and allocate resources. The guidance is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning in fiscal year 2025 and for interim periods beginning in fiscal year 2026 and requires retrospective adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impacts of the new guidance on its financial statement disclosures.",

      "answer": "CMCSA highlights that weak economic conditions negatively impact its advertising revenue due to reduced customer discretionary spending and the rise of free or lower-cost competitive services like DTC streaming. DIS notes that while declines in linear network subscribers are expected to continue, strategic investments in DTC offerings are intended to grow subscription fees and advertising revenue. META specifically attributes adverse effects on advertising revenue to regulatory developments like GDPR and CCPA, as well as changes by third-party platforms such as Apple\u2019s iOS updates, which limit its ability to target and measure ad effectiveness.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in  the  United  States,  in  Europe  or  globally  could  adversely  affect  demand  for  any  of  our  products  and  services  and  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks.  In  particular,  the  success  of  our  theme  parks  and  theatrical  releases  largely  depends  on  consumer  demand  for  out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also cause governments and regulators to impose additional tax or product affordability regulations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as high interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\n## Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  make  acquisitions  and  investments  and  may  pursue  other  strategic  initiatives,  such  as  the  proposed  Spin-off.  In  connection  with  such acquisitions  and  strategic  initiatives,  we  may  incur  significant  or  unanticipated  ex penses,  fail  to  realize  anticipated  benefits  and  synergies,  have  difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

There were no dividends paid or share repurchases in fiscal 2023. The Company is targeting a total of $3 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe Company may be required to pay an incremental amount for Hulu depending on a final determination of Hulu's fair value. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the transactions with noncontrolling interest holders.\n\nThe Company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control. We believe that the Company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, contractual obligations, upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital ex penditures related to the ex pansion of ex isting businesses and development of new projects. In addition, the Company could undertake other measures to ensure sufficient liquidity, such as raising additional financing, reducing or not declaring future dividends; reducing or stopping share repurchases; reducing capital spending; reducing film and episodic content investments; or implementing further cost-saving initiatives.\n\nThe Company's borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of September 28, 2024, Moody's Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, S&amp;P Global Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. The Company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, tax es, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On September 28, 2024, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The Company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.\n\n## DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS\n\n## Star India Transaction\n\nThe Company and RIL plan to close a transaction on or about November 14, 2024, which will form a joint venture that combines our Star-branded and other general entertainment and sports television channels and Disney+ Hotstar service in India (Star India) and certain media and entertainment businesses of RIL (see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). The Company will have a 37% interest in the joint venture. The Company has consolidated, and will continue to consolidate, the income statement and cash flow activities of Star India through the closing date, at which time the Company will recognize on its balance sheet the 37% investment at fair value. In addition, the Company will begin recognizing its proportional share of the joint venture's results in 'Equity in the income of investees, net' in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The equity earnings of the joint venture will not be reported in our segments' operating results.\n\n## Trends\n\nTo drive growth at our sports and entertainment businesses, we are, among other things, making strategic investments in our DTC offerings. Although there can be no assurances these investments will be successful, we expect that they will lead to growth in subscription fees and advertising revenues that will more than offset impacts on affiliate fees and advertising revenue from declines in linear network subscribers and the related decrease in average viewership, which we expect will continue.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs\n\nWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\nProduction costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",

For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, including the CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Other U.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing additional rights for users and could result in restrictions  on  our  use  of  signals  from  third-party  apps  and  websites  through  certain  browser-  and  device-based  universal  opt-out  mechanisms.  Judicial  and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings.\n\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and G oogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\n\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021.  If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\n\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\n\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to",

      "question": "How do Disney (DIS), Google (GOOGL), and Netflix (NFLX) each describe the risks associated with advertising revenue in their 2023 filings, and what does this reveal about their differing dependencies and challenges in monetizing digital advertising?",
      "answer": "Disney (DIS) highlights that declines in economic conditions and regulatory changes, such as privacy laws like the UK's Age Appropriate Design Code and COPPA, impact advertising revenue by limiting marketing to children and increasing compliance costs. Google (GOOGL) emphasizes that problematic content, web spam, and regulatory uncertainty, including evolving data privacy laws and competition-focused regulations like the EU's Digital Markets Act, could harm advertiser trust and platform usage. Netflix (NFLX) notes that as a relatively new entrant to ad-supported streaming, its advertising revenue is subject to risks including limited experience, fluctuating membership, regulatory developments around data privacy, and the effectiveness of analytics tools to demonstrate ad value to marketers. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies face advertising revenue risks, they differ in maturity, regulatory exposure, and strategic positioning in the digital advertising ecosystem.",

        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 Advertising Revenue: Disney notes that privacy laws such as COPPA and the UK's Age Appropriate Design Code impact advertising on digital platforms and increase compliance costs, while economic downturns reduce advertising spending.",

        "Hop 3: NFLX \u2192 Advertising Revenue: Netflix acknowledges limited experience in advertising, risks around member engagement with ads, and regulatory and measurement challenges that could limit ad revenue growth."

It recorded $383 million in net impairment losses for operating lease ROU assets in 2024, indicating active restructuring and asset revaluation. NFLX discloses that it primarily leases real estate with terms ranging from 1 to 15 years, often including renewal options that are incorporated into the lease term when reasonably certain of renewal, and uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine lease present value. VZ categorizes operating lease costs between Cost of Services and Selling, General & Administrative expenses based on usage, and distinguishes variable lease costs as those dependent on a rate, index, or asset usage. Together, these reveal differing levels of lease complexity, impairment activity, and cost allocation strategies across the communication services sector.",

Land  and  assets  held  within construction in progress (CIP) are not depreciated. CIP assets are related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. We also capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the related assets.\n\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\n\n## Lease Obligations\n\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain data centers, offices, and colocations. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate tax es, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase arrangements, and maintenance and utilities.  Such variable lease costs are ex pensed as incurred on our consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\n\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability  of  ex ercising  such  options,  we  consider  contract-based,  asset-based,  entity-based,  and  market-based  factors.  We  do  not  assume  renewals  in  our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\n\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net impairment losses of $383 million, $2.43 billion, and $2.22 billion, respectively, in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining  lease  periods,  and  discount  rates  that  reflect  the  level  of  risk  associated  with  receiving  future  cash  flows.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original ex pected length of one year or less.\n\nRevenue includes sales and usage-based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass-through agent.\n\n## Advertising Revenue\n\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\n\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers.\n\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\n\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration for the reported periods.\n\n## Reality Labs Revenue\n\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in ex change for the products.\n\n## Other Revenue\n\nFoA other revenue consists of revenue from  WhatsApp Business Platform,  Meta  V erified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\n\n## Cost of Revenue\n\nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also consists of costs  associated  with  partner  arrangements,  including  traffic  acquisition  costs  and  credit  card  and  other  fees  related  to  processing  customer  transactions;  RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, META, and AT&T (T) each reflect changes in capital investment through their 2023 cash used in investing activities, and what do these differences suggest about their strategic priorities in network and infrastructure development?",
      "answer": "CMCSA reported $7.2 billion in cash used in investing activities for 2023, a significant decrease from $14.1 billion in 2022, indicating a reduction in capital investment. META spent $27.05 billion on net purchases of property and equipment in 2023, with plans to increase this to $30\u2013$37 billion in 2024, signaling continued aggressive investment in data centers and digital infrastructure. AT&T used $19,660 million in cash for investing activities in 2023, with $17,853 million allocated to capital expenditures, showing a focus on network enhancements and spectrum-related costs. These differences suggest that while CMCSA is pulling back on investment, META is accelerating its infrastructure buildout, and AT&T is maintaining a steady but strategic level of capital deployment.",

      "answer": "CMCSA reported $7.2 billion in cash used in investing activities for 2023, a significant decrease from the prior year, suggesting a reduction in capital-intensive investments. DIS, while not explicitly stating a total figure for 2023, highlighted increased capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 driven by cruise ship fleet expansion and theme park investments, indicating a growth-oriented capital allocation strategy. META, on the other hand, spent $27.05 billion on net purchases of property and equipment in 2023, primarily for data centers and network infrastructure, reflecting a focus on scaling digital infrastructure. The comparative analysis shows that while CMCSA is conserving capital, DIS is expanding physical assets, and META is heavily investing in digital infrastructure, highlighting divergent strategic priorities within the communication services sector.",

VZ has the highest net deferred tax liability at $46,583 million, largely due to spectrum and other intangible amortization at $29,302 million.

Meta had a significantly higher total lease cost of $3,040 million, indicating a more aggressive expansion or investment in leased facilities. Netflix reported a total lease cost of $638.7 million, which is lower than both Disney and Meta, suggesting a more restrained or digital-focused infrastructure approach.

      "question": "How do Disney, Meta, and Netflix each characterize the challenges to advertising revenue in 2023, particularly in relation to regulatory constraints, user engagement volatility, and nascent ad-supported models, and what does this reveal about their respective exposure to advertising-driven revenue risks?",
      "answer": "Disney highlights that regulatory constraints, particularly around data privacy (e.g., GDPR, COPPA, and the UK's Age Appropriate Design Code), limit the design and marketing of digital products and services, directly impacting advertising on their platforms. These laws require significant compliance investments and reduce advertising flexibility. Meta discusses the volatility in user engagement and the impact of technical infrastructure reliability on its ability to serve ads, noting that disruptions can materially affect advertising revenue. Additionally, Meta reports that its Reality Labs investments reduced 2023 operating profit by approximately $16.12 billion, further straining ad-driven profitability. Netflix acknowledges the uncertainty in its nascent ad-supported subscription model, noting limited experience in advertising and a range of risks including advertiser attraction, member dissatisfaction, and regulatory developments around data privacy. Together, these perspectives show that while all three face advertising revenue challenges, Disney is most affected by regulatory constraints, Meta by platform reliability and strategic investments, and Netflix by the early-stage nature of its ad business and content-driven advertiser appeal.",

Amounts are impacted by foreign currency translation each period.\n\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from anticipated synergies and intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including increased footprint,  assembled  workforce,  noncontractual  relationships  and  other  agreements.  We  assess  the  recoverability  of  our  goodwill  annually,  or  more  frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level.  To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.\n\nIn 2022, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $8.1 billion in our Sky reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. When performing this analysis, we also considered multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions. The decline in fair value primarily resulted from an increased discount rate and reduced estimated future cash flows as a result of macroeconomic conditions in the Sky territories. The impairment is presented in goodwill and long-lived asset impairments in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit ex ceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the ex cess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment (see Note 18).\n\nThe impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model relate to projections of future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. Discount rates for each reporting unit are determined based on the inherent risks of each reporting unit's underlying operations. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ.\n\nTo test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets ex ceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the ex cess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our trademarks and FCC licenses, which are our most significant indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 5 to 40 years. The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe Company expects its aggregate annual amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for fiscal 2025 through 2029 to be as follows:\n\n",

Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We record such losses as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income.\n\nIf we determine that a loss is probable or reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The ex cess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangibles Assets\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. G oodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units, Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL), subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2024, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such  assets  may  not  be  recoverable.  The  evaluation  of  these  intangible  assets  are  performed  at  the  lowest  level  for  which  identifiable  cash  flows  are  largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. The impairment charges of finitelived intangible assets were not material during the reporting periods presented.\n\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets.  If  we  change  the  estimated  useful  life  assumption  for  any  asset,  the  remaining  unamortized  balance  is  amortized  over  the  revised  estimated  useful  life. Intangible assets are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses.

      "question": "How do Disney, Google, and Meta each approach the capitalization of software development costs, and what does this reveal about their investment strategies in internal-use technology platforms?",
      "answer": "Disney capitalizes software development costs only after the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes the project, and it is probable the software will be used as intended. As of 2024, Disney had $1.3 billion in capitalized software costs, which are amortized over up to 5 years. In contrast, Google notes that while it capitalizes some internal-use software costs, these amounts were not material for the periods presented, and similarly, development costs for external-use software that meet capitalization criteria were also not material. Meta follows a similar framework to Google, stating that software development costs for internal-use applications can be capitalized once the preliminary project stage is complete and the project is expected to be completed, but also notes that these capitalized costs were not material to date. This suggests that while Disney is making more substantial internal investments in software platforms that are capitalized and amortized, Google and Meta either invest less in such capitalizable internal software or expense a larger portion of these costs upfront, indicating differing strategic approaches to internal technology development and asset recognition.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, ex cept it ex cludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title's unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the ex tent the title's unamortized costs ex ceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\n\n## Content Production Incentives\n\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as 'Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset's amortization period.\n\n## Internal-Use Software Costs\n\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.\n\n## Parks, Resorts and Other Property\n\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n",

T echnological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, dev elopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\n\nSoftware dev elopment costs also include costs to dev elop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based applications used to deliv er  our  serv ices.  We capitalize dev elopment costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for dev eloping such software applications were not material for the periods presented.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair  market  v alue  of  the  underlying  stock  at  the  grant  date.  We  recognize  RSU  expense  using  the  straight-line  attribution  method  ov er  the  requisite serv ice period and account for forfeitures as they occur. RSUs are awarded div idend equiv alents, which are subject to the same v esting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares.\n\nFor  RSUs,  shares  are  issued  on  the  v esting  dates  net  of  the  applicable  statutory  income  tax  withholding  to  be  paid  by  us  on  behalf  of  our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\n\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized ov er the requisite serv ice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair v alue of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity v aluation of the respectiv e Other Bet company.\n\n## Advertising and Promotional Expenses\n\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $9.2 billion, $8.7 billion, and $8.7 billion, respectiv ely.\n\n## Performance Fees\n\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain inv estments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before inv estment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobserv able inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&amp;E.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nFair v alue is an exit price, representing the amount that would be receiv ed to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair v alue are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair v alue hierarchy based on the observ ability of the inputs av ailable in the market used to measure fair v alue:\n\nLevel 1 - Observ able inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in activ e markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in activ e markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not activ e, and model-based v aluation techniques for which all significant inputs are observ able in the market or can be deriv ed from observ able market data.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Content Costs\n\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform. We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. V ideo content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners based on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Ex pensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\n\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\n## Share-based Compensation\n\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are ex pected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax  rates in the period of the enactment.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.06 billion, $2.02 billion, and $2.65 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and T each treat capitalized interest in their 2023 financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their respective capital investment strategies in the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "CMCSA notes that capitalized interest increased in 2023, partially offsetting higher interest expense due to greater average debt and interest rates. This suggests that CMCSA is capitalizing more interest as part of its ongoing investment in long-term assets. DIS capitalizes interest as part of its film and television content production costs, allocating it alongside direct production and overhead expenses, indicating a strategic approach to funding content creation as a long-term asset. T discloses specific dollar amounts for capitalized interest\u2014$874 million in 2023\u2014showing a declining trend from $1,294 million in 2022, which may signal a reduction in major capital projects or financing for such investments. Together, these perspectives reveal differing capital investment strategies: CMCSA is increasing its capitalized interest to offset rising debt costs, DIS is embedding capitalized interest into its content development pipeline, and T is showing a measurable decline in capitalized interest, potentially reflecting a strategic pivot or reduced investment in new capital assets.",

GOOGL highlights that over 75% of its total revenues come from online advertising, making it highly sensitive to changes in advertiser spending, which can be affected by economic volatility and regulatory shifts. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to economic cycles through advertising, they differ in how they anticipate and plan for these impacts, with DIS focusing on DTC growth, CMCSA emphasizing cost pressures and competitive substitution, and GOOGL highlighting regulatory and technological risks alongside its heavy revenue concentration in ads.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in  the  United  States,  in  Europe  or  globally  could  adversely  affect  demand  for  any  of  our  products  and  services  and  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks.  In  particular,  the  success  of  our  theme  parks  and  theatrical  releases  largely  depends  on  consumer  demand  for  out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also cause governments and regulators to impose additional tax or product affordability regulations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as high interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\n## Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  make  acquisitions  and  investments  and  may  pursue  other  strategic  initiatives,  such  as  the  proposed  Spin-off.  In  connection  with  such acquisitions  and  strategic  initiatives,  we  may  incur  significant  or  unanticipated  ex penses,  fail  to  realize  anticipated  benefits  and  synergies,  have  difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

There were no dividends paid or share repurchases in fiscal 2023. The Company is targeting a total of $3 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe Company may be required to pay an incremental amount for Hulu depending on a final determination of Hulu's fair value. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the transactions with noncontrolling interest holders.\n\nThe Company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control. We believe that the Company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, contractual obligations, upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital ex penditures related to the ex pansion of ex isting businesses and development of new projects. In addition, the Company could undertake other measures to ensure sufficient liquidity, such as raising additional financing, reducing or not declaring future dividends; reducing or stopping share repurchases; reducing capital spending; reducing film and episodic content investments; or implementing further cost-saving initiatives.\n\nThe Company's borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of September 28, 2024, Moody's Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, S&amp;P Global Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. The Company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, tax es, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On September 28, 2024, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The Company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.\n\n## DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS\n\n## Star India Transaction\n\nThe Company and RIL plan to close a transaction on or about November 14, 2024, which will form a joint venture that combines our Star-branded and other general entertainment and sports television channels and Disney+ Hotstar service in India (Star India) and certain media and entertainment businesses of RIL (see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). The Company will have a 37% interest in the joint venture. The Company has consolidated, and will continue to consolidate, the income statement and cash flow activities of Star India through the closing date, at which time the Company will recognize on its balance sheet the 37% investment at fair value. In addition, the Company will begin recognizing its proportional share of the joint venture's results in 'Equity in the income of investees, net' in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The equity earnings of the joint venture will not be reported in our segments' operating results.\n\n## Trends\n\nTo drive growth at our sports and entertainment businesses, we are, among other things, making strategic investments in our DTC offerings. Although there can be no assurances these investments will be successful, we expect that they will lead to growth in subscription fees and advertising revenues that will more than offset impacts on affiliate fees and advertising revenue from declines in linear network subscribers and the related decrease in average viewership, which we expect will continue.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs\n\nWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\nProduction costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs  are  based  on  anticipated  release  patterns  and  distribution  strategies,  public  acceptance  and  historical  results  for  similar productions.  Amortization  for  content  predominantly  monetized  with  other  owned  or  licensed  content  is  recorded  based  on estimated  usage.  In  determining  the  method  of  amortization  and  estimated  life  of  an  acquired  film  or  television  library,  we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do  not  capitalize  costs  related  to  the  distribution  of  a  film  in  movie  theaters  or  the  licensing  or  sale  of  a  film  or  television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe may enter  into  cofinancing  arrangements  with  third  parties  to  jointly  finance  or  distribute  certain  of  our  film  productions. Cofinancing  arrangements  can  take  various  forms,  but  in  most  cases  involve  the  grant  of  an  economic  interest  in  a  film  to  an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor's  interest  in  the  profit  or  loss  of  the  film  is  recorded  as  either  a  charge  or  a  benefit,  respectively,  in  programming  and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and  record  an  impairment  charge  to  the  extent  the  unamortized  costs  exceed  the  fair  value.  Owned  content  is  assessed  either individually  or  in  identified  film  groups,  for  content  predominantly  monetized  on  an  individual  basis  or  with  other  content, respectively.  The  substantial  majority  of  our  owned  content  is  evaluated  for  impairment  on  an  individual  title  basis.  Licensed content that  is  not  part  of  a  film  group  is  generally  assessed  in  packages,  channels  or  dayparts. A  daypart  is  an  aggregation  of programs  broadcast  during  a  particular  time  of  day  or  programs  of  a  similar  type.  Licensed  content  is  tested  for  impairment primarily  on  a  channel,  network  or  platform  basis,  with  the  exception  of  our  broadcast  networks  and  owned  local  broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative  value.  Estimated  relative  value  is  generally  based  on  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  nature  of  and  potential  revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment.  When  cash  payments,  including  advanced  payments,  exceed  the  relative  value  of  the  sports  rights  delivered,  we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented with licensed content.\n\n## Note 5: Income Taxes\n\n## Income Before Income Taxes\n\n",

TV/SVOD distribution revenue is primarily reported in Content Sales/Licensing, except for pay-per-view and Premier Access revenues, which are reported in Direct-to-Consumer.\n- Theatrical distribution - Rentals from licensing our film productions to theaters\n- Home entertainment - Sale of our film and television content to retailers and distributors in home video formats\n- Other content sales/licensing revenue - Revenues from licensing our music, ticket sales from stage play performances and fees from licensing our intellectual properties ('IP') for use in stage plays\n- Other revenue - Fees from sub-licensing of sports programming rights (reported in Linear Networks) and sales of postproduction services (reported with Content Sales/Licensing)\n\n## The significant expenses of DMED are as follows:\n\n- Operating expenses consist primarily of programming and production costs, technical support costs, operating labor, distribution costs and costs of sales. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. Programming and production costs also include fees paid to Linear Networks from other DMED businesses for the right to air our linear networks and related services. These costs are largely incurred across four content creation/licensing groups, as follows:\n- Studios - Primarily capitalized production costs related to films produced under the Walt Disney Pictures, Twentieth Century Studios, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Searchlight Pictures banners\n- General Entertainment - Primarily internal production of and acquisition of rights to episodic television programs and news content. Internal content is generally produced by the following television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Television Animation, FX Productions and various studios for which we commission productions for our branded channels and DTC streaming services.\n- Sports - Primarily acquisition of professional and college sports programming rights and related production costs\n- International - Primarily internal production of and acquisition of rights to local content outside the U.S. and Canada.\n- Selling, general and administrative costs, including marketing costs\n- Depreciation and amortization\n\n## Disney Parks, Experiences and Products\n\nThe operations of DPEP's significant lines of business are as follows:\n\n- Parks &amp; Experiences:\n- Theme parks and resorts, which include: Walt Disney World Resort in Florida; Disneyland Resort in California; Disneyland Paris; Hong Kong Disneyland Resort (48% ownership interest); and Shanghai Disney Resort (43% ownership interest), all of which are consolidated in our results.

          "chunk_text": "## Macro-economic Factors:\n\n## Adverse changes in the U.S. securities markets, interest rates and medical costs could materially increase our benefit plan costs and future funding requirements.\n\nOur costs to provide current benefits and funding for future benefits are subject to increases, primarily due to continuing increases in medical and prescription drug costs, and can be affected by lower returns on assets held by our pension and other benefit plans, which are reflected in our financial statements for that year. In calculating the recognized benefit costs, we have made certain assumptions regarding future investment returns, interest rates and medical costs. These assumptions could change significantly over time and could be materially different than originally projected. Lower than assumed investment returns, a decline in interest rates with a corresponding increase in our benefit obligations, and higher than assumed medical and prescription drug costs will increase expenses.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board requires companies to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in their statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur. We have elected to reflect the annual adjustments to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income. Therefore, an increase in our costs or adverse market conditions will have a negative effect on our operating results.\n\nSignificant adverse changes in capital markets could result in the deterioration of our defined benefit plans' funded status and result in increased contribution requirements for such plans, which could be material.\n\n## Inflationary pressures on costs, such as inputs for devices we sell and network components, labor and distribution costs may impact our network construction, our financial condition or results of operations.\n\nAs a provider of telecommunications and technology services, we sell handsets, wireless data cards, wireless computing devices and customer premises equipment manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services and depend on suppliers to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with items such as network equipment, customer premises equipment, and wireless-related equipment such as mobile hotspots, handsets, wirelessly enabled computers, wireless data cards and other connected devices for our customers. In 2021 and the early part of 2022, the costs of these inputs and the costs of labor necessary to develop and maintain our networks and our products and services have rapidly increased. In addition, many of these inputs are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, demand for raw materials used in the production of these devices and network components, weather, climate change, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, governmental actions, import and export requirements (including tariffs), and other factors beyond our control. Although we are unable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2022. We also expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2022.\n\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products and services, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchases altogether, during an economic downturn. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset any cost increases through productivity and cost-saving initiatives.\n\n## Adverse changes in global financial markets could limit our ability and our larger customers' ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operations.\n\nDuring 2021, uncertainty surrounding global growth rates and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to produce volatility in the credit, currency and equity markets. V olatility may affect companies' access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs, or, in some cases, the inability to fund ongoing operations. In addition, we contract with large financial institutions to support our own treasury operations, including contracts to hedge our exposure on interest rates and foreign exchange and the funding of credit lines and other short-term debt obligations, including commercial paper. These financial institutions face stricter capital-related and other regulations in the United States and Europe, as well as ongoing legal and financial issues concerning their loan portfolios, which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit.",

In addition, with the recent change in leadership, there may be additional adjustments to our business strategies. Our new organization and strategies are, among other things, subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits, such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value. For example, notwithstanding our announced plans to rationalize costs, the costs of our DTC strategy, and associated losses, may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which may impact our distribution strategy across businesses/distribution platforms, the types of content we distribute through various businesses/distribution platforms, and the timing and sequencing of content windows. Our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies. In addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer purchasing patterns, acceptance of content offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we have incurred and may continue to incur costs to change our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to write-down the value of assets. For example, current conditions, including COVID-19 and our business decisions, have reduced the value of some of our assets. We have impaired goodwill and intangible assets at our International Channels businesses and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets. We may write-down other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the current business environment. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. In recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks, expansion of our fleet of cruise ships, the acquisition of TFCF and investments related to DTC offerings. Some of these investments have returns that are negative or low, the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments are uncertain, these investments may impact the profitability of our other businesses, and these risks are exacerbated by COVID-19. In any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be negative or lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. Even if our strategies are effective in the long term, our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term, growth of our new offerings is unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not expand into new markets as or when anticipated. Our ability to forecast for new businesses may be impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses, speed with which the competitive landscape changes, volatility beyond our control (such as the events beyond our control noted above) and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based. Accordingly, we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes.\n\n## Increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operators, television networks, SVOD providers and other new sources of broadband delivered content.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with other television and SVOD services, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations. In addition, we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC businesses compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nCompetition in each of these areas may further increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. Increased competition may increase the cost of programming and other products and divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services, deprive us of talent necessary to produce high quality creative material or increase the cost of compensation for our employees. Such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.",

      "answer": "CMCSA recorded an $8.1 billion goodwill impairment in its Sky reporting unit in 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions affecting cash flow projections and increased discount rates. GOOGL allocates goodwill to reporting units based on expected benefits from business combinations and conducts annual impairment tests, with no material impairments recorded in 2024.

Amounts are impacted by foreign currency translation each period.\n\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from anticipated synergies and intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including increased footprint,  assembled  workforce,  noncontractual  relationships  and  other  agreements.  We  assess  the  recoverability  of  our  goodwill  annually,  or  more  frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level.  To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units used to test for impairment periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense.\n\nIn 2022, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $8.1 billion in our Sky reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. When performing this analysis, we also considered multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions. The decline in fair value primarily resulted from an increased discount rate and reduced estimated future cash flows as a result of macroeconomic conditions in the Sky territories. The impairment is presented in goodwill and long-lived asset impairments in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we hav e the power to direct activ ities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and hav e the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits.  If we are not the primary beneficiary in a  VIE, we account for the inv estment or other v ariable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\n\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment is comprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets currently in serv ice, and assets not yet in serv ice.  T echnical  infrastructure  includes  data  center  land,  buildings  and  leasehold  improv ements,  and  serv ers  and  network  equipment.  Office  space includes office land, buildings and leasehold improv ements. Assets not yet in serv ice are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data center buildings and serv ers in the process of construction or assembly.\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets are ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method ov er the estimated useful liv es of the assets, which we regularly ev aluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and utilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings ov er periods of sev en  to 40 years.  We depreciate serv ers  and  network  equipment generally ov er a period of six years.  We depreciate corporate and other assets ov er periods of two  to 25  years.  We depreciate leasehold improv ements ov er the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful liv es of the assets. Land is not depreciated.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We ev aluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relativ e fair v alue allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components.  Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\n\nCertain lease agreements contain v ariable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\n\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present v alue of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present v alue of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily  determinable.  Our  incremental  borrowing  rate  is  estimated  to  approximate  the  interest  rate  on  a  collateralized  basis  with  similar  terms  and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentiv es.\n\nLease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.\n\nOperating lease expense (excluding v ariable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the lease term.  Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recov erable.

Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We record such losses as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income.\n\nIf we determine that a loss is probable or reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The ex cess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangibles Assets\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. G oodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units, Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL), subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2024, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such  assets  may  not  be  recoverable.  The  evaluation  of  these  intangible  assets  are  performed  at  the  lowest  level  for  which  identifiable  cash  flows  are  largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. The impairment charges of finitelived intangible assets were not material during the reporting periods presented.\n\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets.  If  we  change  the  estimated  useful  life  assumption  for  any  asset,  the  remaining  unamortized  balance  is  amortized  over  the  revised  estimated  useful  life. Intangible assets are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses.

      "answer": "In 2023, severance charges played a notable role in each company's cost management strategy. Disney reported $0.4 billion in severance charges, reflecting strategic workforce reductions tied to its broader restructuring efforts, including exiting businesses like Russia and shifting content strategies. Verizon recorded a significantly higher $533 million in severance charges, indicating more extensive involuntary separations under existing plans, which likely align with its broader operational efficiency initiatives. Meanwhile, Comcast noted that lower severance charges in 2023 partially offset overall expense increases, suggesting a more measured or reduced emphasis on workforce restructuring compared to prior years.

Meta saw a significant jump in its 2024 domestic revenue, rising to $66,342 million, a substantial increase from $43,499 million in 2023. In contrast, Verizon's 2024 domestic revenue was $21,253 million, showing growth from $15,668 million in 2023 but remaining below its 2022 level of $26,822 million.

      "answer": "Comcast (CMCSA) quantified approximately $850 million of goodwill and the remainder primarily attributed to software and customer relationship intangible assets from its acquisition of Masergy, highlighting its focus on enterprise customer relationships and technology assets. Disney (DIS) categorizes its intangible assets to include character/franchise intangibles, copyrights, trademarks, MVPD agreements, and FCC licenses, reflecting the importance of brand equity and media distribution rights in its entertainment business. AT&T (T) summarizes its other intangible assets, indicating a general recognition of intangibles but without specifying categories, which suggests a more generalized approach to intangible asset reporting.

The  acquisition  accelerates  our  growth  in  serving  large  and  mid-sized  companies, particularly  U.S.-based  organizations  with  multi-site  global  enterprises.  Masergy's  results  of  operations  are  included  in  our consolidated  results  of  operations  since  the  acquisition  date  and  are  reported  in  our  Cable  Communications  segment.  We  have recorded a preliminary estimate of Masergy's assets and liabilities with approximately $850 million recorded to goodwill and the remainder primarily attributed to software and customer relationship intangible assets. These estimates are not yet final and are subject to change. The acquisition was not material to our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## Note 8: Investments\n\n",

Google showed a decline from $1,092 million in 2022 to $902 million in 2023, indicating a strategic decrease in deferred liabilities possibly linked to tax credits or asset utilization. Netflix, in contrast, saw a small increase from $9,430 thousand in 2022 to $10,000 thousand in 2023, pointing to potential new liabilities or reclassification in deferred tax items.

      "answer": "DIS attributes a 26% increase in advertising revenue to higher impressions driven by Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar subscriber growth and increased cricket programming. GOOGL tracks impressions as a core monetization metric for its Google Network properties, where revenue is tied to cost-per-impression and influenced by advertiser competition, device mix, and market maturity. META recognizes revenue from impression-based ads upon delivery and highlights impressions as a primary revenue driver alongside action-based metrics like clicks. Comparing these perspectives reveals that DIS leverages impressions through content expansion and international sports programming, GOOGL focuses on network scale and advertiser dynamics across devices and geographies, and META monetizes impressions through both direct delivery and user engagement actions.",

        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 Impressions: DIS reports a 26% increase in advertising revenue driven by higher impressions, specifically citing Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar subscriber growth and increased cricket programming, including two ICC tournaments in the current year.",

Factors influencing impressions include advertiser competition, device mix, and traffic growth in emerging vs. mature markets.",
        "Hop 3: META \u2192 Impressions: META recognizes advertising revenue based on delivered impressions and user actions. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is shown to users, and revenue is recognized in the period when impressions or actions occur."

T reported a significant reversal in its foreign currency translation adjustment, moving from a negative $3,926 million in 2020 to a positive $1,962 million in 2021, indicating a major shift in its foreign exchange exposure.

      "answer": "GOOGL reports $19.4 billion in state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, set to begin expiring in 2033, and maintains a valuation allowance indicating it believes a majority will not be realized. META has $2.36 billion in state NOL carryforwards, expiring in 2031, and also holds a large valuation allowance primarily tied to state tax credits. NFLX has $943 million in state NOL carryforwards, which begin expiring as early as 2026, and has recorded a $540 million valuation allowance largely due to uncertainty around realizing these credits. The differences in carryforward amounts, expiration timelines, and valuation allowances suggest varying levels of confidence in future profitability and differing tax planning strategies across the three firms.",

We have federal tax credit carryforwards of $595 million, which will begin to ex pire in 2029, if not utilized, and state tax  credit carryforwards of $5.47 billion, most of which do not ex pire.\n\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three-year period.\n\nThe following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\n\n",

As of December 31, 2024, the valuation allowance of $540 million was primarily related to California R&amp;D tax credits, state net operating loss carryforwards, and foreign tax  credits that the Company does not expect to realize.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we have not provided for applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on an immaterial amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest. For the balance of undistributed earnings for which we are not indefinitely reinvested, we have provided the appropriate taxes.\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as 'Other non-current liabilities' and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as \"Other non-current assets\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

      "answer": "GOOGL reports Property and Equipment, net as a deferred tax liability of $8,189 million in 2023, indicating a tax impact from asset depreciation. META shows a significantly higher net value of Property and Equipment at $96,587 million in 2023, reflecting substantial investment in infrastructure and long-term assets. NFLX reports Property and Equipment, net at $1,491,444 thousand in 2023, with detailed breakdowns showing heavy investment in leasehold improvements and technology. These differences suggest that while META is aggressively expanding its physical and technological infrastructure, NFLX focuses on facility and IT assets aligned with content production, and GOOGL reflects these assets primarily through their tax implications rather than direct valuation.",

      "answer": "In 2024, GOOGL's provision for income taxes rose sharply to $19.697 billion, driven by a significant increase in current federal and state taxes. META's provision was $8.303 billion, showing a decline in deferred tax benefits compared to prior years. NFLX reported a provision of $1.254 billion, with a consistent 13% effective tax rate, influenced by foreign-derived deductions and stock-based compensation benefits. These differences reflect distinct global tax planning strategies and profitability structures across the three communication services firms.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Provision for income taxes: GOOGL's provision for income taxes increased to $19,697 million in 2024, primarily due to a jump in current federal and state taxes from $17,125 million (2023) to $22,485 million (2024), despite declining deferred tax expenses.",
        "Hop 2: META \u2192 Provision for income taxes: META's 2024 provision for income taxes was $8,303 million, with a notable drop in deferred tax benefits (from $131 million in 2023 to $(4,737) million in 2024), indicating a shift in tax asset utilization or valuation allowances.",
        "Hop 3: NFLX \u2192 Provision for income taxes: NFLX's 2024 provision for income taxes was $1,254.0 million, with a stable 13% effective tax rate, largely shaped by foreign-derived intangible income deductions ($502.968 million) and excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation ($435.909 million)."

We expect these trends to continue. Revenue declines also were impacted by the absence of revenues from our cybersecurity business that was contributed to LevelBlue and higher intellectual property sales in the prior year.\n\nEquipment revenues increased in 2024, driven by higher customer premises equipment sales, which can vary from year to year based on the nature of services purchased.\n\nOperations and support expenses decreased in 2024, primarily driven by lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives, lower network access and customer support expenses and the contribution of our cybersecurity business. Partially offsetting the decreases were higher vendor credits in 2023 and higher equipment costs in 2024. As part of our transformation activities, we expect operations and support expense improvements to continue in 2025 as we further right size our operations in alignment with the strategic direction of the business.\n\nDepreciation expense increased in 2024, primarily due to ongoing capital investment for strategic initiatives such as fiber, which we ex pect to further increase in 2025.\n\nOperating income decreased in 2024 and 2023.

      "answer": "Disney reported a 38% year-over-year increase in total operating costs in 2022, with infrastructure costs rising 20% to $2.766 billion, reflecting significant operational expansion. Google highlighted increasing infrastructure costs tied to investments in Google Cloud, hardware development, and global data centers, which are straining operating margins due to the capital-intensive nature of these ventures. AT&T cited infrastructure cost pressures from regulatory requirements, climate-related risks, and 5G deployment challenges, particularly around FAA-related 5G C-band launch delays. Together, these companies demonstrate distinct approaches: Disney's cost increases align with content and operational scaling, Google's reflect strategic bets on cloud and hardware ecosystems, and AT&T's infrastructure costs are shaped by regulatory compliance and climate resilience needs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The investments  that  we  are  making  across  Google  Services,  Google  Cloud,  and  Other  Bets  reflect  our  ongoing  efforts  to innovate  and  provide  products  and  services  that  are  useful  to  users,  advertisers,  publishers,  customers,  and  content providers. Our investments in Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital  and,  in  pursuing  new  strategies,  we  may  incur  unanticipated  liabilities. These  endeavors  may  involve  significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  diversion  of  resources  and  management  attention  from  current  operations  and,  with respect  to  Other  Bets,  the  use  of  alternative  investment,  governance,  or  compensation  structures  that  may  fail  to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\n\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in  product  price  and  performance  characteristics,  and  price  and  feature  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  consumers  and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\n\nWithin  Google  Cloud,  we  devote  significant  resources  to  develop  and  deploy  our  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.\n\nWithin  Other  Bets,  we  are  investing  significantly  in  the  areas  of  health,  life  sciences,  and  transportation,  among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\n\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI and machine learning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\n\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition. Changes  in  device  mix,  geographic  mix,  ongoing  product  and  policy  changes,  product  mix,  and  property  mix  and  an increasing  competition  for  advertising  may  also  affect  our  advertising  revenue  growth  rate.  We  may  also  experience  a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services, among other factors.\n\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such  as  the  continued  expansion  of  our  business  into  new  fields,  including  products  and  services  such  as  hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increased costs for many aspects of our business. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible  we  may  not  be  able  to  protect  some  of  these  innovations.  Moreover,  we  may  not  have  adequate  patent  or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.",

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning other strains of the virus and the actions to contain its impact. Due to the speed with which the situation continues to develop and change, we are not able at this time to estimate the additional impact of COVID-19 on our financial or operational results, but the impact could be material.\n\n## Changes to federal, state and foreign government regulations and decisions in regulatory proceedings, as well as private litigation, could further increase our operating costs and/or alter customer perceptions of our operations, which could materially adversely affect us.\n\nOur subsidiaries providing wired services are subject to significant federal and state regulation while many of our competitors are not. In addition, our subsidiaries and affiliates operating outside the United States are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided. Our wireless and various video subsidiaries are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC and in some instances, by state and local agencies. Adverse regulations and rulings by the FCC relating to broadband and wireless deployment could impede our ability to manage our networks and recover costs and lessen incentives to invest in our networks. The continuing growth of IP-based services, especially when accessed by wireless devices, has created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the FCC and various state and local authorities, which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcomes unfavorable to us. In addition, in response to the FAA questioning whether our 5G C-band launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplanes, we voluntarily committed to a series of temporary, precautionary measures, in addition to deferring turning on a limited number of towers around certain airports to allow the FAA more time to evaluate. The FAA's continued evaluation may impact our planned 5G C-band launch in certain areas. In addition, increased public focus on a variety of issues related to our operations, such as privacy issues, government requests or orders for customer data, and concerns about global climate changes, have led to proposals or new legislation at state, federal and foreign government levels to change or increase regulation on our operations. Enactment of new privacy laws and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to collect and offer targeted advertisements or result in additional costs of compliance or litigation. Should customers decide that our competitors offer a more customer-friendly environment, our competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Effects of climate change may impose risk of damage to our infrastructure, our ability to provide services, and may cause changes in federal, state and foreign government regulation, all of which may result in potential adverse impact to our financial results.\n\nExtreme weather events precipitated by long-term climate change have the potential to directly damage network facilities or disrupt our ability to build and maintain portions of our network and could potentially disrupt suppliers' ability to provide products and services required to provide reliable network coverage. Any such disruption could delay network deployment plans, interrupt service for our customers, increase our costs and have a negative effect on our operating results. The potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires, freezing conditions, sea-level rise, and other climate-related events, could adversely affect our operations, infrastructure, and financial results. Operational impacts resulting from the potential physical effects of climate change, such as damage to our network infrastructure, could result in increased costs and loss of revenue. We could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate such physical effects of climate change. We are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change.\n\nFurther, customers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, and other sustainability concerns. Concern over climate change or other environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment and reduce the impact of our business on climate change. Further, climate change regulations may require us to alter our proposed business plans or increase our operating costs due to increased regulation or environmental considerations, and could adversely affect our business and reputation.",

      "question": "How do Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Netflix (NFLX) each reflect the strategic importance of property and equipment investments in their 2024 financial disclosures, and what do their respective spending trends indicate about their capital allocation priorities in the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Google reported a significant increase in purchases of property and equipment, rising from $32,251 million in 2023 to $52,535 million, indicating a strong emphasis on infrastructure expansion and data center development. Meta also increased its purchases of property and equipment in 2024 to $37,256 million, up from $27,045 million in 2023, reflecting its continued investment in AI infrastructure and metaverse-related facilities. Netflix, while not disclosing exact figures for property and equipment purchases, noted a $91 million increase in this category year-over-year, which is relatively modest compared to its larger investments in content and debt financing activities. Collectively, these trends suggest that Google and Meta are prioritizing physical infrastructure and long-term technological capabilities, while Netflix remains more focused on content creation and financial flexibility.",

The payments for content assets increased $3,862 million, from $13,140 million to $17,003 million, or 29%.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $2,724 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to there being no maturities of investments in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to maturities of investments of $1,395 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, coupled with an increase in purchases of investments of $1,237 million and an increase in purchases of property and equipment of $91 million.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $1,876 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,794 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 and a $663 million increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repayment upon maturity of the $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.750% Senior Notes in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to no repayments of debt in the corresponding period in 2023, coupled with a $218 million increase in the repurchases of common stock.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Google reported a provision for income taxes of $11,922 million, a slight increase from $11,356 million in 2022, indicating relative stability in its tax obligations. Meta experienced a significant 48% increase in its provision for income taxes, reaching $8,330 million in 2023 from $5,619 million in 2022, suggesting stronger taxable income or changes in tax exposure. Verizon saw a decrease in its provision for income taxes, reporting $4,892 million in 2023 compared to $6,523 million in 2022, which may reflect lower profitability or tax planning strategies. These differences highlight varying financial trajectories and tax management approaches across the communication services sector, with Meta showing the most pronounced growth in tax provision, Google maintaining stability, and Verizon reducing its tax outflow.",

      "answer": "Google's domestic revenue grew significantly from $61.3 billion in 2022 to $108.1 billion in 2024, indicating strong expansion in its core U.S. market. Meta also saw a rise in domestic revenue, increasing from $25.0 billion in 2022 to $66.3 billion in 2024, suggesting a strategic shift or rebound in its U.S. operations. In contrast, Verizon's domestic revenue declined from $26.8 billion in 2022 to $21.3 billion in 2024, signaling potential challenges or market saturation in its traditional U.S. telecom business. Together, this highlights differing regional growth dynamics: Google and Meta are capitalizing on domestic opportunities, while Verizon faces headwinds in the same market.",

      "question": "How do DIS, T, and VZ each disclose or experience changes in service revenues, and what do these differences reveal about their respective business models and market dynamics in the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "DIS discloses that a significant portion of its service revenues comes from subscription fees to its DTC streaming services, affiliate fees, advertising revenues, and admissions to theme parks. These diverse service revenue streams reflect DIS's integrated entertainment and media business model. T reports that service revenues increased in 2024, driven by growth in subscribers and ARPU, despite unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, indicating a telecom-focused growth strategy. VZ discloses service revenues and other of $111.571 billion in 2024, showing relative stability compared to 2023 and 2022 figures, which suggests a mature and stable telecom services market position. Together, these perspectives highlight how DIS leverages content-driven services, T pursues subscriber and ARPU growth in a dynamic market, and VZ maintains a large, stable service revenue base.",

The fiscal 2023 presentation has been adjusted to conform with the fiscal 2024 presentation. (1)\n\n## 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The Walt Disney Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements.\n\n## Reporting Period\n\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were fifty-two week years.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2024 presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues and Costs from Services and Products\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\nSignificant service revenues include:\n\n- Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising revenues\n- Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n- Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n- Royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games",

      "question": "How do Disney, AT&T, and Verizon differ in their credit loss reserve trends over the past three years, and what does this reveal about their approaches to customer credit risk management in the evolving media and telecom landscape?",
      "answer": "Disney's credit loss reserves decreased from $2.9 billion in 2022 to $3.0 billion in 2024, showing relative stability. AT&T's reserves declined significantly from $1,011 million in 2022 to $756 million in 2023, indicating either improved credit quality or a more aggressive risk posture. In contrast, Verizon increased its reserves from $1,151 million in 2021 to $1,609 million in 2023, suggesting a more conservative approach or higher perceived credit risk in its customer base. These divergent trends suggest differing risk management philosophies and potentially different exposures to consumer credit challenges in the communication services sector.",

      "question": "How do Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Verizon (VZ) each disclose their exposure to operating lease assets in their 2024 financial statements, and what does this reveal about their capital structure strategies and operational flexibility?",
      "answer": "Google disclosed $2.5 billion in additional operating lease assets recognized in 2024, with $17.0 billion in total future lease payments under operating leases, indicating a growing reliance on leased assets to support infrastructure expansion. Meta reported $14.922 billion in operating lease right-of-use assets on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, showing a significant but more mature leasing strategy aligned with its office and data center footprint. Verizon disclosed $24.472 billion in operating lease right-of-use assets as of the same date, suggesting a heavy reliance on leased infrastructure, particularly in its wireless and retail operations. The comparative analysis reveals that while all three companies use operating leases, Verizon has the highest exposure, likely due to its capital-intensive telecom infrastructure, whereas Google is increasing its leasing activity in line with AI and data center investments, and Meta maintains a moderate and stable leasing posture.",

      "answer": "Disney used $1.5 billion in cash for other investing activities in 2024, primarily for an investment in Epic Games, Inc., signaling a strategic move into gaming and digital ecosystems. Meta used $27.05 billion in cash for investing activities in 2023, mainly for data centers, servers, and network infrastructure, reflecting its continued investment in AI and digital infrastructure. AT&T used $19,660 million in cash for investing activities in 2023, primarily for capital expenditures on network infrastructure and spectrum development, indicating a focus on enhancing its telecommunications capabilities. The differences in scale and focus of these investments highlight distinct capital allocation strategies: Disney is investing in digital entertainment expansion, Meta is doubling down on infrastructure to support AI and metaverse initiatives, and AT&T is prioritizing network modernization and operational resilience.",

      "answer": "CMCSA reports redeemable noncontrolling interests of $241 million as of December 31, 2023, showing a decrease from $411 million in 2022, indicating a reduction in minority stake obligations. DIS, on the other hand, reports no redeemable noncontrolling interests as of September 30, 2023, down from $9,055 million in the prior year, suggesting a significant deconsolidation or buyout of minority interests. GOOGL discloses a stable redeemable noncontrolling interest of $1.1 billion in both 2022 and 2023, signaling a consistent minority stake position it continues to manage without major changes. Together, these figures reflect varying strategies: CMCSA is modestly reducing its exposure, DIS is eliminating it entirely, while GOOGL maintains a steady position.",

      "question": "How do GOOGL, NFLX, and VZ each experience the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments on their total comprehensive income or loss, and what does this reveal about their exposure to global currency fluctuations in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GOOGL reported a foreign currency translation adjustment of $735 million, contributing positively to its total comprehensive income of $3,201 million. NFLX, on the other hand, experienced a negative foreign currency translation adjustment of $176,811 thousand in 2022, which improved to $113,384 thousand in 2023, contributing to its total comprehensive loss of $6,639 thousand. VZ reported a foreign currency translation adjustment of $62 million in 2023, which was a relatively small contributor to its total comprehensive income of $485 million. These differences highlight varying degrees of exposure to global currency fluctuations, with NFLX showing the most significant volatility in foreign currency translation adjustments year-over-year, while GOOGL and VZ demonstrated more stability.",

      "answer": "GOOGL reports 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities' at $2,887 million in 2024, reflecting a slight increase from 2023 and positioned alongside operating and finance lease liabilities. META discloses 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities' at $2,223 million in 2024, showing growth from $2,168 million in 2023, and is listed within a broader context of deferred tax assets and lease liabilities. NFLX, while not directly listing a standalone 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities' figure, indirectly references it through derivative liabilities, with $140,089 thousand tied to foreign exchange contracts as of December 31, 2023. Together, these disclosures suggest differing approaches: GOOGL and META maintain traditional liability reporting, while NFLX emphasizes derivative-related obligations, indicating a more hedging-focused strategy.",

      "question": "How do META, NFLX, and VZ compare in their management of total current assets, and what does this reveal about their liquidity strategies in the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "META reported total current assets of $100,045 million in 2024, showing a significant increase from $85,365 million in 2023, driven by growth in marketable securities and cash equivalents. NFLX reported much higher total current assets of $13,100,379 thousand in 2024 compared to $9,918,133 thousand in 2023, largely due to a surge in short-term investments. VZ, on the other hand, had total current assets of $40,523 million in 2024, up from $36,814 million in 2023, primarily driven by increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. These differences suggest that META is focusing on building cash reserves and marketable securities, NFLX is leveraging short-term investments for liquidity, and VZ is maintaining a more conservative approach with steady growth in receivables and prepayments.",

      "question": "How do Google (GOOGL), AT&T (T), and Verizon (VZ) each characterize the impact of competitive pressures and strategic investments on their 2023 revenue growth rates, and what does this reveal about their respective business models and market positioning in the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "Google (GOOGL) highlights that its revenue growth rate could decline due to competitive pressures, diversification into lower-margin businesses like devices and cloud, and significant investments in AI and Other Bets. AT&T (T) notes revenue growth in Mobility and Consumer Wireline, offset by declines in Business Wireline, and cites transformation efforts and foreign exchange impacts. Verizon (VZ) emphasizes the risk of competitive pressures reducing sales volumes or long-term growth rates, particularly in its Business reporting unit, which was assessed for goodwill impairment. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three face competitive headwinds, they respond through distinct strategic investments and operational adjustments that align with their core business models.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Revenue Growth Rate: Google explicitly states that its revenue growth rate could decline due to competition, diversification into lower-margin businesses, and ongoing investments in AI, cloud, and Other Bets, which may not yield adequate returns.",
        "Hop 2: T \u2192 Revenue Growth Rate: AT&T reports revenue growth in 2023 driven by Mobility and Consumer Wireline, but notes continued declines in Business Wireline. It attributes part of the growth to favorable foreign exchange and transformation efforts that reduced costs.",
        "Hop 3: VZ \u2192 Revenue Growth Rate: Verizon highlights the risk of competitive pressures reducing sales volumes or long-term growth rates and notes that adverse macroeconomic factors like interest rates could negatively impact goodwill valuations, particularly in its Business reporting unit."

      "answer": "Disney reported total lease costs of $1,530 million in 2024, up from $1,213 million in 2022, showing a steady increase in leasing activity. Google had significantly higher total lease costs, rising from $4,246 million in 2022 to $5,173 million in 2024, driven largely by increases in variable lease costs. Netflix had total lease costs of $665.973 million in 2024, up from $608.428 million in 2022, indicating more modest growth compared to Google but a consistent upward trend. These differences suggest varying approaches to facility and infrastructure investment, with Google showing the most aggressive expansion, Disney maintaining a moderate growth path, and Netflix adopting a more controlled leasing strategy.",

      "question": "How do the contrasting trends in DIS, T, and VZ's 'Balance at Beginning of Period' reflect different financial strategies or risk exposures in the communication services sector, particularly considering DIS reported $3.2 billion in 2024, T reported $756 million, and VZ reported $1,609 million for this metric?",
      "answer": "The divergent trends in the 'Balance at Beginning of Period' among DIS, T, and VZ suggest varying financial strategies and risk exposures within the communication services sector. DIS shows a relatively stable but slightly increasing trend, rising from $2.8 billion in 2022 to $3.2 billion in 2024, indicating a consistent financial posture possibly aligned with steady investment or operational performance. In contrast, T exhibits a significant decline in this balance, falling from $1,163 million in 2022 to $756 million in 2024, which may signal higher deductions or aggressive financial commitments, as seen in its $2,172 million in deductions for 2024. VZ, however, demonstrates a more moderate upward trajectory, growing from $1,151 million in 2022 to $1,609 million in 2024, with notable additions charged to expenses ($2,269 million in 2024), suggesting a more active reinvestment or provisioning strategy. Collectively, these differences highlight how each company manages liquidity and risk, with implications for investor confidence and market positioning.",

Netflix recorded a provision for income taxes of $1,254,026 thousand with a consistent effective tax rate of 13%, indicating stable international tax planning strategies. Verizon disclosed a provision for income taxes of $5,030 million, which contributed to its overall net income of $17,949 million, suggesting a relatively lower tax burden in its sector. These differences highlight distinct tax planning and operational profitability strategies across the communication services industry.",

In our opinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated January 29, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nSan Jose, California January 29, 2025",

      "question": "How do Comcast, Netflix, and AT&T each guide on subscriber growth assumptions in their financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to market saturation and customer retention in the evolving communication services sector?",
      "answer": "Comcast (CMCSA) guides on subscriber growth by emphasizing strategic bundling and broadband-driven customer acquisition, reflecting a focus on integrated services to mitigate churn. Netflix (NFLX) centers its guidance on international expansion and content investment as key levers for subscriber growth, indicating a global-first strategy to tap into underpenetrated markets. AT&T (T), in contrast, guides on subscriber growth through a discounted cash flow model that assumes rising subscriber and revenue growth aligned with long-term inflation trends, with churn rates expected to align with industry-leading benchmarks. AT&T\u2019s approach reflects a more infrastructure-heavy, domestically rooted perspective with a focus on stable, long-term growth. When synthesized, these differing approaches highlight distinct business models: Comcast leans on bundling for retention, Netflix prioritizes global content scalability, and AT&T anchors its strategy in domestic network assets and stable churn assumptions.",

The Greenfield Approach assumes a company initially owns only the wireless licenses and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. These licenses are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis, consistent with their use on a national scope for the United States. For impairment testing, we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected levels, with a long-term growth rate reflecting ex pected long-term inflation trends. We assume churn rates will initially ex ceed our current ex perience but decline to rates that are in line with industry-leading churn. We used a discount rate of 8.75%, based on the optimal long-term capital structure of a market participant and its associated cost of debt and equity for the licenses, to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows. If either the projected rate of long-term growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 0.5%, or if the discount rate increased by 0.5%, the fair values of these wireless licenses would still be higher than the book value. The fair value of these wireless licenses exceeded their book values by more than 10%.\n\nIncome Taxes Our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in Note 13 and reflect our assessment of actual future tax es to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the final review of our tax returns by federal, state or foreign tax  authorities.\n\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We regularly review our uncertain tax  positions and adjust our unrecognized tax  benefits (UTBs) in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our UTBs may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\nSee Note 1 for discussion of recently issued or adopted accounting standards.\n\n## OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS\n\nEnvironmental We are subject from time to time to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various governmental authorities under federal, state or local environmental laws. We reference in our Forms 10-Q and 10-K certain environmental proceedings that could result in monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) of three hundred thousand dollars or more. However, we do not believe that any of those currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, Comcast faced declining advertising revenue due to platform shifts, including the rise of DTC streaming and OTT services, audience fragmentation, and reduced linear television viewership. These trends directly impacted advertisers' willingness to purchase ad time and the rates they paid. Disney's advertising revenue was negatively affected by macroeconomic conditions, such as inflationary pressures and reduced consumer spending, which impacted advertiser budgets and guest spending at its parks and resorts. Meta faced challenges maintaining stable advertising revenue due to volatility in its user base, engagement levels, and technical infrastructure disruptions, which affected its ability to serve ads reliably. Additionally, Meta's Reality Labs investments reduced its operating profit by approximately $16.12 billion in 2023, indirectly impacting its advertising-focused financial performance.",

      "question": "How do the profitability trends of Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and AT&T (T) in 2023 reflect their differing business models and exposure to tax-related risks, particularly in light of GOOGL's 15% year-over-year net income growth, META's uncertainty around global tax policy changes, and T's relatively stable but lower net income of $2.4 billion?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Alphabet (GOOGL) reported a net income of $73.795 billion, showing a 15% increase from the prior year, indicating strong profitability likely driven by its dominant advertising business and disciplined cost management. Meta (META), while not disclosing its exact 2023 net income, highlighted significant exposure to tax-related risks stemming from global tax policy shifts, including the OECD's 15% minimum tax framework and digital services taxes in multiple jurisdictions\u2014these uncertainties could materially impact its future net profit. AT&T (T), on the other hand, reported a much smaller net income of $2.393 billion in 2023, reflecting a more mature and capital-intensive business model with stable but lower-margin operations. The contrast between GOOGL's robust growth, META's regulatory and tax exposure, and T's subdued profitability illustrates how each company's business model interacts differently with macroeconomic and fiscal policy environments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Net Profit: GOOGL's 2023 net income was $73.795 billion, up 15% year-over-year, indicating strong profitability and operational performance.",
        "Hop 2: META \u2192 Net Profit: META highlights that global tax policy changes\u2014including the OECD's 15% minimum tax and digital services taxes\u2014could materially impact its financial position and net profit, signaling significant risk to future net income.",
        "Hop 3: T \u2192 Net Profit: T reported a net income of $2.393 billion in 2023, significantly lower than both GOOGL and likely META, reflecting a different scale and margin profile typical of a traditional telecom operator."

      "answer": "Disney (DIS) reports a slight decrease in 'Other Deferred Tax Liabilities' from $78 million in 2023 to $78 million in 2024, indicating relative stability in this component of their deferred tax liabilities. Google (GOOGL) shows a more significant decline in 'Other Deferred Tax Liabilities' from $902 million in 2023 to $1,008 million in 2024, suggesting potential tax adjustments or liabilities recognition during the year. Netflix (NFLX) does not explicitly disclose a line item for 'Other Deferred Tax Liabilities,' but its 'Other' category under deferred tax liabilities decreased from $15,354 thousand in 2023 to $9,430 thousand in 2024, which may reflect a reduction in certain tax obligations or strategic tax management.
