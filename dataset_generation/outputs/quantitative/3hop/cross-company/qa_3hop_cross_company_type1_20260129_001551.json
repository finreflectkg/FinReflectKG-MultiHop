      "answer": "GM's total net sales and revenue increased by $13.067 billion (10.2%) in 2023, with $3.2 billion of that growth attributed to higher pricing, including average selling price improvements. In contrast, Tesla reported a lower average selling price in 2023 due to year-over-year price reductions and sales mix shifts, which partially offset the revenue growth from an increase of 473,382 combined Model 3 and Model Y deliveries. This indicates that while GM benefited significantly from pricing power, Tesla faced downward pressure on revenue from lower ASP despite higher volume.",

      "answer": "HD's goodwill balance increased by $4,870 million in fiscal 2020 and $323 million in fiscal 2021, while SBUX's International Segment experienced a decrease of $391.6 million in goodwill balance in fiscal 2021 after a prior increase of $78.6 million in fiscal 2020.

      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: HD \u2192 Goodwill Balance: HD's goodwill balance had a major increase of $4,870 million in fiscal 2020 and a smaller increase of $323 million in fiscal 2021, indicating significant acquisition activity in 2020.",

        "Hop 3: International Segment \u2190 SBUX: SBUX operates in multiple international markets through both company-operated and licensed stores, and the goodwill changes in the International Segment reflect strategic decisions or market performance impacts in those regions."

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of GM's allowance for loan losses to forecast recovery rate changes compare to Amazon's exposure to expected credit losses in their investment portfolio, given the role of expected credit losses in both companies' financial risk management?",
      "answer": "GM's allowance for loan losses is sensitive to forecast recovery rates, with a 5% relative decrease increasing the allowance by $0.1 billion. This allowance reflects expected credit losses over the life of the receivables. Similarly, Amazon records expected credit losses on its marketable debt securities, which are evaluated for impairment based on whether declines in fair value are due to credit losses. Both companies rely on estimates of expected credit losses to manage financial risk, though GM's exposure is more directly tied to economic forecasts, while Amazon's is tied to market conditions and the credit quality of its investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 Allowance for Loan Losses: GM discloses that a 5% relative decrease in forecast recovery rates would increase its allowance for loan losses by $0.1 billion, indicating sensitivity to economic conditions.",
        "Hop 2: Allowance for Loan Losses \u2192 Expected Credit Losses: The allowance for loan losses reflects net credit losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is based on past events, current conditions, and forecast economic performance.",
        "Hop 3: Expected Credit Losses \u2190 AMZN: Amazon records expected credit losses on its available-for-sale debt securities, evaluating whether declines in fair value below cost are due to credit losses, which are then recognized through an allowance."

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein.\n\nOur sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy. Adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales. Many U.S. and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance. These include, but are not limited to, periods of slow economic growth or recession, home price appreciation or decreasing housing turnover, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to Lowe's and its customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending, inflation and its impacts on discretionary spending and on our costs, shortages, and other disruptions in the labor supply, consumer debt levels, changes in tax rates and policy, outbreak of pandemics, fluctuations in fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, armed conflicts, and acts of both domestic and international terrorism. Sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects. Adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services.\n\nOur business could be affected by uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, including natural disasters and changes in climate, as well as other catastrophic events, which could impact our operations.\n\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions, such as major or extended winter storms or droughts, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; pandemics and public health concerns; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; civil unrest; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. These types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities. They can also disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. In addition, these events may affect our information systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores. Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures, could render a portion of our inventory damaged or unsellable. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\n\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to the long-term effects of global climate change.\n\nOur business and operations are subject to inherent climate-related risks. These include both physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts, and rising sea levels may impact the areas in which the Company's operations and facilities are located, and they could also affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. Such events could result in an increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue, cash flows and financial performance. Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulations affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. In addition, we also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns.\n\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.\n\nOur business is subject to a wide array of federal, state and local laws and regulations. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies.

      "question": "How did Tesla's price reductions in 2022, which risked profitability, compare in strategic intent to Amazon's price reductions that drove a 22% sales increase in international markets, and how might this reflect differing impacts on unit sales growth between the two companies?",
      "answer": "Tesla's price reductions in 2022 were a competitive response to market pressures and aimed at maintaining demand amid supply chain and production risks, but they negatively impacted profitability. In contrast, Amazon's price reductions were part of a broader strategy to drive unit sales growth, contributing to a 22% increase in international sales in 2021. While Tesla's approach risked margin compression without guaranteed unit volume gains, Amazon directly tied its price reductions to increased unit sales, suggesting a more demand-responsive pricing strategy. This contrast highlights how pricing tactics can differ in intent and outcome depending on the company's market positioning and operational structure.",

          "chunk_text": "of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more costeffective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nIn addition, the cost of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Moreover, any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\n## We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\n\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. For example, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. Many of our competitors have significantly greater or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing long-term leases and PPAs.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Operations\n\n## We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\n\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we produce several vehicle components, such as battery modules and packs and drive units at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, and we also manufacture energy storage products at Gigafactory Nevada. In the past, some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity, and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai production, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\n\n## We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign",

Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2021. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.\n\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed  securities.  Our  investment  guidelines,  which  we  may  change  from  time  to  time,  prescribe  certain  minimum  credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.\n\nWe use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the total size of our credit facilities was $18.5 billion, which consisted principally of four revolving credit facilities. In April 2021, we increased the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $10.5 billion facility to $11.2 billion and extended the termination date for a $9.9 billion portion of the five-year facility by three years, now set to mature on April 18, 2026. The termination date of April 18, 2023 for the remaining portion of the five-year facility remains unchanged. We also renewed and increased the total borrowing capacity of our three-year, $4.0 billion facility to $4.3 billion, which now matures on April 7, 2024, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use by GM Financial, which now matures on April 6, 2022. We also terminated a separate 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into in May 2020. Additionally, the prior restrictions on share repurchases and dividends on our common shares were removed upon entrance into the renewed three-year, $4.3 billion facility. In December 2021, we terminated our three-year, $2.0 billion transformation credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the total size of our credit facilities was $15.5 billion, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities.\n\nIf available capacity permits, GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nSeveral of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2021 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.\n\nGM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $3.5 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.4 billion on its common stock in  2021,  2020,  and  2019.  Current  dividend  levels  are  reflective  of  GM  Financial  earnings  supported  by  strong  residual  values, favorable  credit  performance  and  improved  economic  conditions.  Future  dividends  from  GM  Financial  will  depend  on  several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.",

Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(59.6) billion and $(58.2) billion in 2020 and 2021, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $35.0 billion, and $55.4 billion in 2020 and 2021, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion in 2020 and 2021.\n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.1) billion and $6.3 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $17.3 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $18.4 billion and $20.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $11.6 billion and $7.1 billion in 2020 and 2021, reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS.\n\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility, $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs, and $803 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility (the 'Credit Facility') as of December 31, 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $7.6 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nTax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2019 and a partial election for 2020 and 2021. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion for 2020 and 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which will delay the deductibility of these expenses and potentially increase the amount of cash taxes we pay.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $257 million and $260 million. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' and 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\n\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We expect to fund the acquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash on hand.\n\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.",

      "answer": "Tesla's total finite-lived intangible assets decreased slightly from $456 million in 2020 to $450 million in 2021, while General Motors' gross carrying amount for intangible assets remained relatively stable, decreasing marginally from $6,043 million in 2020 to $6,026 million in 2021. This suggests Tesla may have been reducing or optimizing its investment in finite-lived intangibles during this period, whereas GM maintained a more consistent approach to its intangible asset base.",

In contrast, SBUX's International segment had a goodwill balance of $2,788.5 million in fiscal 2024.

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of GM's $2.3 billion allowance for loan losses to economic forecast scenarios compare with Tesla's approach to provisioning for expected credit losses on its financing receivables, given the role of expected credit losses in both companies' loan loss estimation processes?",
      "answer": "GM Financial's allowance for loan losses of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2023, is based on expected credit losses over the remaining life of its retail finance receivables, with sensitivity to forecast scenarios such that a shift to the weakest economic scenario would increase the allowance by $0.1 billion. Tesla also provisions for expected credit losses on its financing receivables, considering historical loss levels, current economic trends, and reasonable forecasts affecting future cash flow collectability. Both companies rely on expected credit losses as a key input in determining their allowance for loan losses, though Tesla does not quantify its forecast sensitivity explicitly as GM does.",

        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 Allowance for Loan Losses: GM discloses a $2.3 billion allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables, with sensitivity to economic forecast scenarios (e.g., weakest scenario increases allowance by $0.1 billion).",
        "Hop 2: Allowance for Loan Losses \u2192 Expected Credit Losses: The allowance for loan losses is based on expected credit losses over the remaining life of the receivables portfolio, as seen in both GM and general financial accounting practices.",
        "Hop 3: Expected Credit Losses \u2190 TSLA: Tesla discloses that it determines its allowance for loan losses based on expected credit losses, incorporating historical losses, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts, though it does not quantify scenario sensitivity."

      "question": "How might BKNG's exposure to prepayment-related financial losses from travel service provider bankruptcies impact GM's vehicle sales strategy, given GM Financial's role in dealer financing and the sensitivity of its operations to capital availability?",
      "answer": "BKNG faces financial risk from prepayments made to travel service providers, particularly if those providers declare bankruptcy and prepayments cannot be recovered, which could negatively impact BKNG\u2019s profit margins. This risk is amplified in situations where travel service providers cease operations, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased chargebacks and unrecoverable prepayments. GM relies on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to dealers, which is critical for supporting vehicle sales and market penetration. However, GM Financial\u2019s ability to offer these services is sensitive to the performance of its loan and lease portfolios, including charge-offs and delinquencies, which could be exacerbated by broader economic disruptions affecting consumer and dealer liquidity. If BKNG\u2019s financial strain from prepayment losses contributes to a broader economic downturn or credit tightening, it could indirectly affect GM\u2019s sales strategy by reducing consumer and dealer access to financing through GM Financial, which depends on stable capital markets and low delinquency rates to maintain competitive financing offers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BKNG \u2192 Prepayments: BKNG is exposed to financial losses when travel service providers go bankrupt and prepayments cannot be recovered, especially during events like the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased chargebacks and unrecoverable prepayments.",
        "Hop 2: Prepayments \u2192 GM Financial: GM Financial\u2019s operations are sensitive to charge-offs and delinquencies in its loan and lease portfolios, which could be affected by broader economic disruptions impacting consumer and dealer liquidity.",
        "Hop 3: GM Financial \u2190 GM: GM depends on GM Financial to provide financing and leasing services to customers and commercial loans to dealers, which are essential for supporting vehicle sales and expanding market penetration."

          "chunk_text": "Regulators may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to laws that govern payments activities, such as money transmission and online payments processing, which could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in certain jurisdictions or result in modification of our business plans. Regulations relating to operational resilience, banking, privacy, and security of our processes could also apply to us. Further, our payments systems are susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services, and transactions by or with sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and failure to maintain compliance could lead to fines or require us to modify or interrupt our business practices, plans, or operations, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and profit margins.\n\nWe are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with the card schemes and our payment card processors, and indirectly to the rules of payment systems in respect of credit (i.e. account to account) transfers. The rules of the card schemes and payment systems are updated in cycles, and we may need to adjust our systems and/or processes to comply with any updated obligations. Card association rules include the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (the \"Standard\"). Under the Standard and these association rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties, and in some cases, we could be restricted in our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances in our agreements with the card schemes and in relation to the Standard, we are also subject to periodic audits, self-assessments, and other assessments of our compliance with the rules and obligations of the payment card associations and the Standard, which could result in additional expenses and administrative burdens. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no consumer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. Additionally, compliance with the Standard may not prevent all security incidents. If we are fined or required to pay additional processing fees or if our ability to accept payment cards is restricted in any way as a result of our failure to comply with these payment card industry rules, or otherwise, it could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and profit margins.\n\nWe rely on banks, card schemes, and other payment processors to execute certain components of the payments process. For inbound payments, we pay these third parties interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees to help facilitate payments from consumers to travel service providers. As a result, if we are unable to maintain our relationships with these third parties on favorable terms or if these fees are increased for any reason, our profit margin, business, and results of operations could be harmed. Additionally, if these third parties experience service disruptions or if they cease operations (whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise), consumers and travel service providers could have difficulty making or receiving payments, which could adversely impact our reputation, business, and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, in the event that one of our major travel service providers voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy or otherwise ceases or limits operations, we could experience an increase in chargebacks from customers with travel reservations with such travel service provider and we could experience financial loss from certain prepayments made to such travel service provider if we are not able to recover the prepayment. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing effects on travel, many customers canceled flights in exchange for credits for future travel. If customers are not able to use these credits before they expire and we are ultimately responsible for chargebacks directly or through the travel service providers, including situations where we are unable to recover from the travel service providers, it could result in a corresponding negative impact on our results.\n\nIncreased focus on our environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") responsibilities have and will likely continue to result in additional costs and risks, and may adversely impact our reputation, employee retention, and willingness of customers and partners to do business with us.\n\nInvestors, proxy advisory services, regulatory authorities, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG practices of companies. We are moving towards setting ESG goals and enhancing related disclosure of goals, progress, and other matters relating to ESG. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately disclose ESG-related goals and objectives present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, reputation, and stock price.\n\nOur ability to achieve ESG goals and initiatives is subject to numerous risks including: (1) the availability and cost of limiting or eliminating our use of carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (2) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, (3) our ability to work with partners and providers that can meet our sustainability, diversity, and other standards, (4) our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent, (5) the impact of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations on our ESG goals, and (6) customers' actual demand for ESG-oriented product offerings, which may be more expensive and less available than other options.",

Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure.

      "answer": "Tesla's 2024 10-K filing indicates that the company has historically achieved sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs, and continues to monitor its public narrative and brand through investments in customer education and advertising 'as necessary.' In contrast, General Motors explicitly lists advertising as a core component of its Automotive Segment expenses in the 2024 filing, alongside other operational costs like manufacturing, logistics, and engineering. GM\u2019s Automotive Segment reporting includes advertising as a key factor in its broader automotive cost structure, which directly affects its profitability metrics like EBIT-adjusted. This contrast highlights Tesla\u2019s lean marketing model versus GM\u2019s more traditional, advertising-supported automotive strategy, with Tesla potentially reallocating marketing savings toward product development or cost optimization in its direct sales model.",

By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\n\n## Solar Energy Systems\n\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall.\n\n## Design and Engineering\n\n## Automotive\n\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our team has significant ex perience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\n\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, diemaking and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We continue to monitor our public narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in customer education and advertising as necessary.\n\n## Automotive\n\n## Direct Sales\n\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more affordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\n\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

This program is integrated with the Starbucks Mobile App and is available in many international markets, including China, Japan, and other parts of the International segment. In contrast, General Motors invests in software-enabled subscriptions such as OnStar, Super Cruise, and future offerings like Ultra Cruise and Ultifi, which provide recurring revenue streams through automotive technology services.

Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission's decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission's decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission's state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter.\n\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.\n\n## Note 10 - SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and content,' 'Marketing,' and 'General and administrative' based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company's business performance and manages its operations.\n\n## North America\n\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.\n\n## International\n\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.\n\n## AWS\n\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.",

Business\n\nGeneral  Motors  Company  (sometimes  referred  to  as  we,  our,  us,  ourselves,  the  Company,  General  Motors,  or  GM)  was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries,  primarily  in  China,  with  vehicles  developed,  manufactured  and/or  marketed  under  the Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet  and  Wuling  brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  and commercialization  of  autonomous  vehicle  technology.  We  provide  automotive  financing  services  through  our  General  Motors Financial  Company,  Inc.  (GM  Financial)  segment.  Refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7.  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our  segments.  Except  for  per  share  amounts  or  as  otherwise  specified,  amounts  presented  within  tables  are  stated  in  millions. Forward-looking  statements  in  this  Business  section  are  not  guarantees  of  future  performance  and  may  involve  risks  and uncertainties  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  projected.  Refer  to  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  and  the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business  opportunities,  while  strengthening  our  market  position  in  profitable  internal  combustion  engine  (ICE)  vehicles,  such  as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). We have committed to an all-electric future with a core focus on zero emission battery EVs as  part  of  our  long-term  strategy  to  reduce  petroleum  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions. As  a  result,  we  have committed to making total EV and AV investments of more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025.\n\nWe have an opportunity to grow our vehicle and financing revenue by continuing to capitalize on the strength of our franchises and scaling our EV production and customer base over the next decade. We also have the potential of growing our revenue through our software-enabled services and subscriptions, including OnStar, our advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), Super Cruise, and  future  offerings,  such  as  our  next-generation  ADAS,  Ultra  Cruise,  and  Ultifi.  Additionally,  we  are  incubating  several  new businesses with a start-up mindset that we believe will enable us to attract new customers and generate revenues in new areas.\n\nElectric Vehicles We plan to launch more than 30 EVs globally by 2025. A key element in our EV strategy is Ultium, our all-new dedicated battery electric platform. Our first Ultium-based products launched with the GMC HUMMER EV and BrightDrop EV600 in  2021,  to  be  followed  by  the  Cadillac  LYRIQ  in  2022. This  all-new  platform  is  flexible  and  will  be  leveraged  across  multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, allowing for quick response to customer preferences and a shorter design and development lead time compared to our ICE vehicles.\n\nIn September 2021, we announced three new drive assist motors as part of Ultium Drive, calibrated in-house to ensure the highest level of performance in Ultium-based EVs. We designed the motors as a scalable family, sharing design principles as well as similar tooling and manufacturing strategies.\n\nIn November 2021, we began production at GM's Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center (Factory ZERO), which was re-tooled into a fully dedicated EV facility to produce the GMC HUMMER EV and the upcoming Cruise Origin and Chevrolet Silverado EV, which we revealed in January 2022 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. In January 2022, we announced that we will convert our assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan for production of the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the  electric  GMC  Sierra. Additionally,  we  have  announced  plans  to  mass-produce  battery  cells  for  these  and  other  future  EVs through Ultium Cells LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in Lordstown, Ohio, Spring Hill, Tennessee and Lansing, Michigan. A fourth U.S.-based battery cell plant is also planned by mid-decade.\n\nTo  support  mass  market  adoption  of  EVs,  we  are  working  to  ensure  that  our  customers  will  have  access  to  comprehensive charging solutions. For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging needs at home, the workplace and in public locations.  For  fleet  vehicles,  this  means  turnkey  charging  solutions  and  fleet  and  facility  energy  management  services. We  have announced collaborative work with several charge network operators to filter real-time data on their respective",

      "question": "How might Tesla's approach to maintaining loan loss provisions based on customer creditworthiness impact its financial risk profile compared to GM Financial's use of static pool modeling, given GM's $13.3 billion exposure in dealer financing?",
      "answer": "Tesla maintains its loan loss provisions by emphasizing strong creditworthiness at loan origination, focusing on applicants' ability to pay and credit history. This contrasts with GM Financial's approach, which uses static pool modeling supplemented by management judgment and incorporates economic forecasts such as unemployment rates and GDP growth to estimate expected losses over the life of receivables. Given GM's significant $13.3 billion dealer financing exposure, this modeling-based approach allows GM Financial to dynamically adjust for macroeconomic risks, whereas Tesla's strategy appears more reliant on upfront credit quality, potentially exposing it to greater variability in loss estimates under changing economic conditions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla reported $1,465 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue, which represented approximately 3.1% of its total automotive revenues of $47,232 million. Meanwhile, GM's automotive segment generated $108,669 million in net sales and revenue. This stark contrast highlights Tesla's strategic reliance on regulatory credits as a complementary revenue source to support its electric vehicle (EV) market leadership, while GM's broader automotive segment revenue reflects its diversified approach that includes both traditional and electrified vehicle platforms. Tesla\u2019s declining regulatory credit revenue (-7% YoY) suggests a maturing EV market, whereas GM\u2019s larger automotive revenue base indicates a transitional phase balancing legacy internal combustion engine vehicles with emerging EV platforms.",

      "answer": "MCD faces exposure to rent escalations that are tied to inflation indices and fair-value market adjustments, which can significantly increase its leasing costs over time. These escalations are often triggered by 'other charges' such as increased real estate tax assessments, as noted in the MS_10k_2023 document. GM\u2019s 2023 financial results demonstrated the material impact of unexpected charges\u2014like the $1.1 billion EBIT-adjusted loss from the UAW strike\u2014highlighting how sudden cost increases can severely disrupt earnings. If MCD experiences a widespread rise in real estate taxes or other mandatory lease-based charges, especially in markets where escalation clauses are indexed to inflation, it could face a similar strain on operating margins, particularly given its large real estate footprint and fixed-cost structure.",

      "answer": "MCD values its performance-based RSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model that depends on the market price of its stock, which introduces volatility in compensation expenses tied to stock performance. This market price also indirectly influences commodity selling prices, as demonstrated by the fact that selling prices are partially adjusted based on market price fluctuations. HD, on the other hand, actively monitors commodity price changes and may adjust its selling prices accordingly\u2014such as during fiscal 2023 when HD managed inflation and deflation in commodity products\u2014but notes that competitive pressures limit its ability to fully recover cost increases through pricing. Therefore, while MCD's equity compensation is directly tied to stock market volatility, HD faces operational pricing constraints due to external market forces.",

      "question": "How do Tesla's expected credit losses on financing receivables compare to GM's allowance for loan losses, given the role of expected credit losses in determining allowance levels?",
      "answer": "Tesla evaluates expected credit losses on its financing receivables by considering historical credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable forecasts affecting future cash flow collectability. These expected losses directly inform the provision for loan losses, which is maintained to ensure the allowance for loan losses is adequate. At the same time, GM Financial explicitly states that its allowance for loan losses of $2.3 billion reflects expected credit losses over the remaining life of its retail finance receivables, which have a weighted-average remaining life of approximately two years. The allowance is sensitive to forecast changes\u2014e.g., a 5% relative decrease in forecast recovery rates would increase the allowance by $0.1 billion. Therefore, Tesla\u2019s expected credit losses influence its allowance for loan losses in a similar conceptual framework as GM\u2019s, though Tesla does not disclose a specific dollar amount for its allowance, while GM\u2019s allowance is directly tied to forecasted economic performance and recovery rates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TSLA \u2192 Expected Credit Losses: Tesla considers historical credit losses, current economic trends, and forecasts to determine expected credit losses on financing receivables, which directly affect the provision and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.",
        "Hop 2: Expected Credit Losses \u2192 Allowance for Loan Losses: Expected credit losses are a key input in determining the allowance for loan losses, as evidenced by the fact that the carrying value of loans includes the allowance, which represents expected credit losses over the loan's remaining life.",
        "Hop 3: Allowance for Loan Losses \u2190 GM: GM Financial maintains an allowance for loan losses of $2.3 billion, which reflects expected credit losses over the remaining life of its retail finance receivables, and notes that a 5% relative decrease in forecast recovery rates would increase the allowance by $0.1 billion."

      "answer": "In 2024, McDonald's financial performance was impacted by restructuring charges tied to the sale of its business in South Korea, which contributed to a 1% decrease in diluted earnings per share and an 8% drop in free cash flow. Meanwhile, General Motors recorded $631 million in charges related to delays in Cruise's Origin robotaxi development, and a further $522 million in charges in December 2024 after deciding to stop funding Cruise's robotaxi work, which led to a combined $142 million in impairment charges at GM related to Cruise\u2019s technology and intellectual property write-offs.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

In contrast, NKE experienced a 6% decrease in combined unit sales in fiscal 2022, despite a 7% currency-neutral revenue increase in Converse, driven by declines in Asia and global supply chain issues. This contrast suggests that while international sales can drive unit volume growth (as seen in LOW and AMZN), NKE may be facing specific regional or operational challenges\u2014particularly in Asia and through global supply chain disruptions\u2014that are limiting its ability to convert international demand into unit sales.

Wholesale revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China as well as global supply chain constraints.

Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points as higher margins in direct to consumer, growth in licensee revenues, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, were partially offset by higher product costs due to increased freight, duty and logistics costs.

Most of the secured debt was issued by VIEs and is repayable only from proceeds related to the underlying pledged assets. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on GM Financial's involvement with VIEs. GM Financial is required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional collateral for borrowings under certain secured credit facilities. The weighted-average interest rate on secured debt was 1.27% at December 31, 2021. The revolving credit facilities have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2027 and securitization notes payable have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2034.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

In contrast, GM includes equity income as part of its automotive segment expenses, which offsets certain costs related to manufacturing, materials, and logistics.

          "chunk_text": "## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, ex pected term and ex pected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and ex pected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax  assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax  assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, ex cess tax  benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of ex isting temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future tax able income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.",

Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more costeffective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nIn addition, the cost of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Moreover, any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\n## We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\n\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. For example, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. Many of our competitors have significantly greater or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing long-term leases and PPAs.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Operations\n\n## We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\n\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we produce several vehicle components, such as battery modules and packs and drive units at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, and we also manufacture energy storage products at Gigafactory Nevada. In the past, some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity, and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai production, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\n\n## We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign",

      "answer": "A slowdown in U.S. disposable personal income growth could negatively impact both Lowe's sales growth and GM Financial's auto financing performance. For Lowe's, the company specifically notes that slower growth in real disposable personal income could reduce consumer spending on home improvement projects, which directly affects their sales growth. GM Financial incorporates disposable personal income forecasts into its credit loss modeling for retail finance receivables, indicating that declining income levels could lead to higher delinquencies and charge-offs. This dual impact suggests that a sustained slowdown in disposable income growth would likely constrain Lowe's sales growth while simultaneously increasing credit risk in GM Financial's loan portfolio, creating parallel pressures on both companies' financial performance.",

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein.\n\nOur sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy. Adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales. Many U.S. and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance. These include, but are not limited to, periods of slow economic growth or recession, home price appreciation or decreasing housing turnover, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to Lowe's and its customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending, inflation and its impacts on discretionary spending and on our costs, shortages, and other disruptions in the labor supply, consumer debt levels, changes in tax rates and policy, outbreak of pandemics, fluctuations in fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, armed conflicts, and acts of both domestic and international terrorism. Sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects. Adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services.\n\nOur business could be affected by uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, including natural disasters and changes in climate, as well as other catastrophic events, which could impact our operations.\n\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions, such as major or extended winter storms or droughts, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; pandemics and public health concerns; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; civil unrest; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. These types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities. They can also disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. In addition, these events may affect our information systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores. Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures, could render a portion of our inventory damaged or unsellable. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\n\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to the long-term effects of global climate change.\n\nOur business and operations are subject to inherent climate-related risks. These include both physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts, and rising sea levels may impact the areas in which the Company's operations and facilities are located, and they could also affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. Such events could result in an increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue, cash flows and financial performance. Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulations affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. In addition, we also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns.\n\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.\n\nOur business is subject to a wide array of federal, state and local laws and regulations. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies.

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more costeffective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nIn addition, the cost of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Moreover, any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\n## We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\n\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. For example, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. Many of our competitors have significantly greater or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing long-term leases and PPAs.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Operations\n\n## We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\n\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we produce several vehicle components, such as battery modules and packs and drive units at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, and we also manufacture energy storage products at Gigafactory Nevada. In the past, some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity, and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai production, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\n\n## We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign",

      "answer": "HD reported net earnings of $16,433 million in fiscal 2022, which is a GAAP-based metric representing earnings after all expenses including interest and taxes. Net earnings serve as the closest GAAP equivalent to EBIT, which is a non-GAAP metric that excludes interest and tax expenses to assess operational efficiency. GM, on the other hand, uses EBIT-adjusted to evaluate its core operational performance by excluding items such as impairment charges, recall-related costs, and currency devaluations, allowing for a more consistent comparison across periods and strategic decisions. Thus, while HD's net earnings reflect the final profitability figure under GAAP, GM's EBIT-adjusted is tailored to isolate and measure ongoing operational performance by removing one-time or unusual items.",

For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  consolidated diluted  EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares  outstanding-diluted.  Examples  of  income  tax  adjustments  include  the  establishment  or  reversal  of  significant  deferred  tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our  core  operations  on  a  consistent  basis.  ETR-adjusted  is  calculated  as  Income  tax  expense  less  the  income  tax  related  to  the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before  income  taxes  less  adjustments. When  we  provide  an  expected  adjusted  effective  tax  rate,  we  do  not  provide  an  expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  investment  and  capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review  the  liquidity  of  our  automotive  operations  and  to  measure  and  monitor  our  performance  against  our  capital  allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted  automotive  free  cash  flow  as  automotive  operating  cash  flow  from  operations  less  capital  expenditures  adjusted  for management actions.  Management  actions  can  include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "LOW's net earnings are sensitive to changes in inventory reserve estimates, with a 10% change in the obsolete inventory reserve impacting net earnings by approximately $13 million for 2021, and a 10% change in the inventory shrink reserve impacting net earnings by $31 million. This highlights the direct effect of inventory valuation assumptions on reported profitability. In contrast, NKE evaluates operating segment performance using EBIT, which excludes interest, taxes, and certain centrally managed foreign exchange impacts. NKE's approach focuses on operational efficiency at the segment level, whereas LOW's sensitivity analysis underscores how accounting estimates directly affect bottom-line results.

Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $13 million for 2021. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $31 million for 2021.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.  However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective long-term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year.  Adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.\n\n## Long-Lived Asset Impairment\n\n## Description\n\nWe review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  When evaluating locations for impairment, our asset group is at an individual location level, as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable.  Cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead.\n\nWe evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long-lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location's assets may not be recoverable. For operating locations, our primary indicator that assets may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a twelve month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results. Management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment, including individual locations' execution of their operating plans and local market conditions, including incursion, which is the opening of either other Lowe's locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market. We also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n\nA potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location's assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets. The carrying value of a location's asset group includes inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and operating liabilities including inventory payables, salaries payable and operating lease liabilities. Financial and nonoperating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location, management makes assumptions, incorporating local market conditions, about key store variables including sales growth rates, gross margin and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and operating expense, as well as asset residual values or lease rates. Operating lease payments are included in the projected future cash flows. Financing lease payments are excluded from the projected future cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\n\nWe use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations, which requires discounting projected future cash flows. This involves making assumptions regarding both a location's future cash flows, as described above, and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows. We discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows. The selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours.\n\nWe use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure. This involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated. The information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets.",

Global Brand Divisions costs represent demand creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Company's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, Corporate included a non-recurring impairment charge, recognized as a result of the Company's decision to transition certain NIKE Brand businesses within APLA to a third-party distributor. This charge primarily reflected the anticipated release of associated non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses. For more information regarding this charge, refer to Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures.\n\nThe primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nAs part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency.

      "answer": "Starbucks' International Segment goodwill balance decreased from $2,756.7 million in fiscal 2022 to $2,691.1 million in fiscal 2023, a decline of $65.6 million, before increasing to $2,788.5 million in fiscal 2024. In contrast, Booking Holdings reported no goodwill impairment as of September 30, 2023, with its goodwill balance net of $2 billion in cumulative impairment charges. This indicates that while Starbucks experienced a direct reduction in goodwill during 2023, Booking Holdings maintained stable goodwill without new impairments despite its history of significant write-downs.",

This increase would negatively impact GM's residual value estimates for leased vehicles, since those estimates are partially based on assumptions about future fuel prices and are sensitive to market conditions. At the same time, HD acknowledges that its supply chain and operational costs are affected by fuel and other energy source prices. Therefore, rising fuel costs due to higher natural gas prices could reduce profitability for both companies by lowering asset recovery values at GM and increasing operating expenses at HD.",

Realization  of  the  residual  values  is  dependent  on  the  future  ability  to market the vehicles under future prevailing market conditions.\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the lease  residual  estimation  process,  including  controls  over  management's  review  of  residual  value estimates obtained from the Company's third-party provider and other significant assumptions.\n\nOur  procedures  also  included,  among  others,  independently  recalculating  depreciation  related  to equipment on operating leases and performing sensitivity analyses related to significant assumptions.

      "answer": "Tesla's price reduction strategy in 2022 was aimed at mitigating the impact of rising battery material costs and strong competition, which could have otherwise led to lower vehicle unit sales and loss of market share. Meanwhile, Amazon explicitly stated that its efforts to reduce prices for customers contributed to a 22% increase in international sales and an 18% increase in North America sales in 2021, primarily driven by higher unit sales. However, Tesla's automotive business model\u2014where unit sales are constrained by manufacturing capacity and supply chain bottlenecks\u2014differs significantly from Amazon's e-commerce model, where unit sales can scale more rapidly with pricing incentives and fulfillment network expansion.

          "chunk_text": "of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more costeffective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nIn addition, the cost of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Moreover, any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\n## We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\n\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. For example, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. Many of our competitors have significantly greater or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing long-term leases and PPAs.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Operations\n\n## We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\n\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we produce several vehicle components, such as battery modules and packs and drive units at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, and we also manufacture energy storage products at Gigafactory Nevada. In the past, some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity, and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai production, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\n\n## We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign",

      "answer": "GM's allowance for loan losses in 2023 was $2.3 billion, with a sensitivity showing that a 5% relative decrease in forecast recovery rates would increase the allowance by $0.1 billion. This reflects a structured approach to quantifying credit risk in its automotive financing operations. In contrast, Booking Holdings discloses provisions for expected credit losses primarily related to accommodation commission receivables and prepayments, indicating a different type of credit exposure tied to its travel booking platform. Both companies quantify expected credit losses, but GM\u2019s detailed sensitivity analysis highlights a more formalized modeling of economic forecast impacts, whereas Booking Holdings focuses on transactional and counterparty risks in its merchant services.",

      "answer": "SBUX's Corporate and Other segment's goodwill balance remained constant at $1.0 million from fiscal 2023 to 2024, indicating no changes in acquisition activity within that segment. In contrast, HD's consolidated goodwill balance increased significantly from $8,455 million at the start of fiscal 2024 to $19,475 million by the end of the year, driven by $11,048 million in acquisitions. This stark contrast highlights that while SBUX's Corporate and Other segment was not actively acquiring during this period, HD pursued a robust acquisition strategy, particularly in its 'Other' category, which accounted for $11,025 million in goodwill by year-end.",

        "Hop 2: Corporate and Other Segment \u2192 Goodwill Balance: The Corporate and Other segment's goodwill contribution is explicitly listed as $1.0 million in both fiscal years, showing no change.",

In contrast, General Motors reported a $0.3 billion increase in advertising, selling, and administrative costs in 2024, indicating a more aggressive investment in brand positioning and dealer transition strategies.

      "answer": "Rising unemployment rates could reduce consumer spending power and confidence, as noted by HD, which may lead to higher delinquencies and defaults on automotive loans. GM Financial uses unemployment rates as a key economic indicator in forecasting expected credit losses on its finance receivables. As a result, GM Financial may need to increase its allowance for loan losses, which would be charged to operations and could negatively impact GM\u2019s ability to support vehicle sales through financing, as GM relies on GM Financial to provide competitive leasing and loan options to customers and dealers.",

We seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers and service providers. If we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a provider of high-quality products and services, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty. In addition, we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing, which is an increasing focus of government regulators as well. All of our suppliers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environment, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. We have a responsible sourcing audit process, but we are also dependent on our suppliers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards and applicable law. Actual, potential or perceived supplier non-compliance could expose us to litigation or governmental enforcement actions, and could result in costly product recalls and other liabilities.\n\n## Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, intellectual property, supplier relations, and reputational risks.\n\nIn addition to other product-related risks discussed in this section, as we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers' products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses.\n\nWe act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM customers through professional third-party licensed and insured installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting, and handling of environmental risks, as well as quality of work performed by our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and manage customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. However, as we experienced in part with our recent EPA investigation and resulting consent decree in April 2021, if we fail to manage these processes effectively, collect the appropriate documentation, perform regular job site inspections, or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines, lawsuits, or governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as claims for property damage or personal injury. In addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business.\n\n## Legal, Financial, Regulatory, Global and Other External Risks\n\nUncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political and social climate, public health issues, and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance.\n\nOur financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political or social climate could adversely impact our customers' confidence or financial condition, causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. Other factors beyond our control - including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft; interest rate fluctuations; inflation or deflation; fuel and other energy costs; raw material or other shortages; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; changes in tax rates and policy; weather; natural disasters; climate change; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by government regulators or others; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; and civil unrest,",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "The goodwill balance allocated to the International Segment, which includes Starbucks' China reporting unit, increased from $2,691.1 million in fiscal 2023 to $2,788.5 million in fiscal 2024 \u2014 a rise of $97.4 million. This growth in goodwill suggests that Starbucks' international operations, particularly in China, maintained or increased their intangible value during this period.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2024, NIKE Brand saw a slight increase in gross margin (10 basis points) due to lower product costs, driven by reduced ocean freight and logistics costs, despite higher input costs. Starbucks, on the other hand, experienced volatility in product costs as seen in their cash flow hedges, with a $100.8 million gain in coffee hedges and a $1.3 million gain in dairy hedges for FY2024, indicating exposure to commodity price fluctuations that can affect gross margin stability.

      "answer": "LOW's advertising spend increased from 0.90% of sales in 2023 to 0.96% in 2024, indicating a growing emphasis on marketing in its retail operations. In contrast, GM's 2024 filing explicitly states that advertising is a core component of Automotive Segment expenses, listed alongside material and logistics, manufacturing, and people-related costs. GM also notes that advertising is part of the segment\u2019s selling, general, and administrative expenses that are essential to its operational strategy. This suggests that while LOW is modestly increasing its advertising investment, GM views advertising as a structurally integral and strategically prioritized cost within its automotive business model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LOW \u2192 Advertising: LOW's advertising expense increased from $869 million (0.90% of sales) in 2023 to $831 million (0.96% of sales) in 2024, showing a rising proportional investment in advertising.",
        "Hop 2: Advertising \u2192 Automotive Segment: GM's 2024 filing identifies advertising as a key component of Automotive Segment expenses, specifically stating that it is part of the segment's selling, general and administrative costs which include people-related costs and policy, campaign, and warranty expenses.",
        "Hop 3: Automotive Segment \u2190 GM: GM's inclusion of advertising in its core Automotive Segment expenses highlights its strategic importance to GM's business, in contrast to LOW's retail-focused advertising which is a smaller and more variable cost."

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "question": "How might Tesla's exposure to price reduction pressures, as a result of competitive dynamics in electric vehicles, contrast with Nike's strategy of increasing average selling prices amid declining unit sales, and what does Amazon's experience suggest about the relationship between unit sales and pricing strategies?",
      "answer": "Tesla warns that competitive pressures could lead to price reductions, which may harm profitability and market share, as seen in their 2022 10-K. In contrast, Nike managed a 12% increase in average selling price (ASP) in fiscal 2022 despite a 6% decline in combined unit sales, leveraging growth in direct-to-consumer and licensing. Amazon's 2022 10-K suggests that reducing prices can drive unit sales growth, as was the case in 2021 where price reductions contributed to increased unit sales across both North America and International segments. This implies a complex trade-off: while Nike successfully raised prices despite lower unit volumes, Tesla faces risks that price cuts by competitors could undermine its position, and Amazon shows that price reductions can stimulate demand, suggesting that the relationship between pricing and unit sales is context-dependent and influenced by market dynamics.",

We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan.\n\n## FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2022 due to revenue growth in North America, Western Europe and licensee markets, partially offset by declines in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 22%, led by strong digital demand. Wholesale revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China as well as global supply chain constraints. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels decreased 6%, while ASP increased 12%, driven by growth in direct to consumer.\n\nReported EBIT increased 23%, driven by gross margin expansion and higher revenues, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points as higher margins in direct to consumer, growth in licensee revenues, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, were partially offset by higher product costs due to increased freight, duty and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense, while operating overhead increased primarily due to higher professional services costs.",

          "chunk_text": "of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more costeffective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nIn addition, the cost of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Moreover, any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\n## We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\n\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. For example, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. Many of our competitors have significantly greater or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing long-term leases and PPAs.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Operations\n\n## We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\n\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we produce several vehicle components, such as battery modules and packs and drive units at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, and we also manufacture energy storage products at Gigafactory Nevada. In the past, some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity, and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai production, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\n\n## We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign",

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country.\n\nWe defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months.\n\nWhen a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue.\n\n## Other Revenues\n\nOther revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms.\n\nOther revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestl\u00e9 related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestl\u00e9 are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales.\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods and packaging costs as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $416.7 million, $305.1 million and $258.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

          "chunk_text": "## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, ex pected term and ex pected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and ex pected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax  assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax  assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, ex cess tax  benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of ex isting temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future tax able income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.",

Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

This growth in unit sales directly reflects the positive impact of international demand on sales volume. In contrast, NKE experienced a 12% decline in combined unit sales (wholesale and direct to consumer), primarily due to drops in North America and Western Europe. While AMZN capitalized on global unit sales growth, especially internationally, NKE faced challenges in these same regions, leading to a divergence in performance.

Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are ex pensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three to five years.\n\nSoftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are ex pected to become significant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customers.\n\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we have recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\n\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of ex change rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $57 million, gain of $122 million and loss of $89 million, respectively.\n\n## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Starbucks has allocated $2,788.5 million in goodwill to its international segment as of September 29, 2024, with a significant portion tied to the China reporting unit. This indicates a strong strategic emphasis on Asia, particularly China, as a core growth market. In contrast, Amazon's international segment assets primarily consist of property and equipment, operating leases, inventory, and accounts receivable, suggesting a more operational and infrastructure-focused approach rather than intangible investments like goodwill. This contrast implies that Starbucks is placing high value on brand recognition and market position in international markets, especially China, whereas Amazon's international strategy appears more logistics and fulfillment oriented.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SBUX \u2192 Goodwill Balance: Starbucks reports a total goodwill balance of $3,315.7 million, with $2,788.5 million specifically allocated to the international segment as of September 29, 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Goodwill Balance \u2192 International Segment: The international segment, particularly the China reporting unit, represents the majority of Starbucks' goodwill, indicating a strategic emphasis on its international footprint.",
        "Hop 3: International Segment \u2190 AMZN: Amazon's international segment assets include property and equipment, operating leases, inventory, and accounts receivable, with no specific goodwill allocation disclosed, suggesting a different strategic focus."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

In contrast, Tesla manages similar expenses through a combination of cost controls and stock-based compensation, where $1,245 million of its selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2024 were attributed to stock-based compensation, which is recognized over the vesting period and impacts financial statements differently.

We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, ex pected term and ex pected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and ex pected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax  assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax  assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, ex cess tax  benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of ex isting temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future tax able income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.",

      "question": "How did the growth in Amazon's international unit sales in 2021 influence its international sales performance relative to Lowe's international sales growth, factoring in foreign exchange rate impacts?",
      "answer": "Amazon's international unit sales growth in 2021 contributed to a 22% increase in international sales, despite fulfillment inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. However, foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced this growth by $3.0 billion in 2021. In contrast, Lowe's international sales grew from $5,294 million in 2021 to $5,902 million in 2022, a 11.5% increase. This suggests that while Amazon's international sales growth outpaced Lowe's in 2021, the impact of foreign exchange and operational challenges limited the realized growth compared to the underlying unit sales momentum.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

This ties executive compensation directly to operating profit performance. In contrast, GM's recall-related charges, such as the $2.6 billion accrued for the Chevrolet Bolt battery recall, directly reduce operating profit and could materially affect the achievement of such performance metrics. While HD uses operating profit as a forward-looking incentive mechanism, GM experiences it as a backward-looking cost exposure that can significantly impact financial results and, by extension, the payout of profit-linked incentives.",

After further investigation into the manufacturing processes at our battery supplier, LG  Energy Solution (LGES), and disassembling battery packs, we determined that the risk of battery cell defects was not confined to the initial recall population. As a result, in August 2021, we expanded the recall to include all 2017-2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt EV  and Chevrolet Bolt Electric Utility V ehicles (EUVs). LG Electronics, Inc. (LGE) and LGES (collectively, LG ), have agreed to reimburse GM for certain costs and expenses associated with the recall. The commercial negotiations with LG  also resolved other commercial matters associated with our Ultium Cells Holdings LLC joint venture with LGES. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, we had accrued a total of $2.6 billion and recognized receivables totaling $1.6 billion in connection with these matters. At December 31, 2024, our remaining accrual for these matters was $0.3 billion.  These charges reflect our current best estimate for the cost of the recall remedy, which includes non-traditional recall remedies provided by GM to enhance customer satisfaction. The actual costs of the recall could be materially higher or lower.\n\nIn addition, putative class actions have been filed against GM in the U.S. and Canada alleging that the batteries contained in the Bolt EV s and EUV s included in the recall population are defective. G M has agreed to settle the U.S. class actions for an immaterial amount and the settlement agreement is pending final court approval.\n\nOpel/Vauxhall Sale In  2017,  we  sold  the  Opel/V aux hall  Business  to  PSA  G roup  (now  Stellantis)  under  a  Master Agreement  (the Agreement).  We also sold the European financing subsidiaries and branches to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. Although the sale reduced our new vehicle presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators related to vehicles sold before the sale. General Motors Holdings LLC agreed, on behalf of our wholly owned subsidiary (the Seller), to indemnify Stellantis for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the Agreement and for certain other liabilities, including costs related to certain emissions claims, product liabilities and recalls. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions either directly or through an indemnification claim from Stellantis. Certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments.\n\nCurrently, various consumer lawsuits have been filed against the Seller and Stellantis in G ermany, the UK, Austria and the Netherlands alleging that Opel and Vauxhall vehicles sold by the Seller violated applicable emissions standards. In addition, we indemnified Stellantis for an immaterial amount for certain recalls that Stellantis has conducted or will conduct, including recalls in certain geographic locations that Stellantis intends to conduct related to Takata inflators in legacy Opel vehicles. We may in the future be required to further indemnify Stellantis relating to its Takata recalls, but we believe such further indemnification to be remote at this time.\n\nEuropean Commission and UK Competition and Markets Authority Matter In March 2022, the European Commission and UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) conducted inspections at the premises of, and sent out formal requests for information to, several companies and associations active in the automotive sector. The investigations concern conduct related to coordination regarding the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life cars and vans, which are considered waste. GM was not the subject of the inspections but has since received requests for information related to activities conducted by Opel, a former subsidiary business we sold to  Stellantis in 2017.  G M has replied to the  European  Commission's and  CMA's requests for information.  The inspections and requests for information are preliminary investigatory steps and do not prejudge the outcome of the investigations, and as of December 31, 2024, we had accrued an immaterial amount related to this matter. If an infringement is established as to Opel's conduct, there are a range of possible outcomes, including fines, which could be material.\n\nPrivacy and Consumer Protection Matters There are putative class actions pending against GM in federal courts in the U.S. alleging violations of state and federal privacy and consumer protection laws related to the collection and use of certain consumer data obtained through our former OnStar Smart Driver product. In June 2024, those class actions were consolidated into a multi-district litigation proceeding in the Northern District of G eorgia. In addition, a number of federal and state agencies and attorneys general have opened investigations or made inquiries of us relating to these alleged consumer protection and privacy issues. The Company is fully cooperating with these agencies and attorneys general. At this stage, we are not able to estimate any reasonably possible or probable material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions.\n\nProduct Liability and Breach of Warranty We record liabilities related to product liability claims in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities for the ex pected cost of all known product liability claims, plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured.

This investment is likely reflected in the $19,286 million in identifiable assets reported under the Technologies segment, which remained relatively stable compared to 2023 ($19,534 million), indicating ongoing but controlled capitalization of technological capabilities. In contrast, Starbucks allocates identifiable assets\u2014such as ROU assets, net property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets\u2014across its operating segments to evaluate performance, though it does not disclose specific figures per segment. This implies Tesla is consolidating AI capabilities into identifiable asset values, while Starbucks focuses on broader operational asset deployment.",

      "answer": "Tesla does not incur traditional advertising expenses due to its direct-to-consumer sales model, which minimizes marketing spend and results in lower selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses. In contrast, GM includes advertising as a core component of its automotive segment expenses, reflecting its reliance on dealership networks and brand promotion. This structural difference leads to higher SG&A costs for GM compared to Tesla, where customer acquisition is driven through online channels and word-of-mouth rather than traditional advertising campaigns.",

          "chunk_text": "## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, ex pected term and ex pected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and ex pected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax  assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax  assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, ex cess tax  benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of ex isting temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future tax able income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.",

      "answer": "GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment due to declining market conditions in China. This charge reduces GM Financial's available capital, which could constrain its ability to meet primary cash outflows such as interest costs. GM Financial's primary uses of cash include interest costs, and any reduction in capital could affect liquidity. In contrast, HD capitalizes interest costs related to construction in progress and software development, which delays the immediate cash impact. Furthermore, HD evaluates long-lived assets quarterly for impairment, and while it recorded no material impairment charges in fiscal 2024, its approach to asset impairment and interest capitalization differs from GM Financial's exposure to equity investment risks.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

Enhancements to our digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who research products online and check available inventory before going into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate and then make their purchase in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our investments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical retail presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in our digital channels is on a mobile device. Mobile customers expect more simplicity and relevancy in their digital interactions. As a result, we have made significant investments to our digital properties to improve the overall presentation and ease of navigation for the user. We have also enhanced the 'shopability' of an online product by including more information on the product's landing page, including related products and/or parts of a collection, and a multitude of fulfillment options. Our focus on improving search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation, product content, speed to checkout, and enhanced fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic, better conversion and continued sales growth. It has also been critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers have gravitated even more to the digital environment.\n\nFurther, we do not view the interconnected shopping experience as a specific transaction; rather, we believe it encompasses an entire journey from inspiration and know-how, to purchase and fulfillment, to post-purchase care and support. Customers expect more personalized messaging, so we are focusing on connecting marketing activities with the online and in-store experiences to create a seamless series of engagements across channels. From the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product know-how, we are continuing to invest in the infrastructure and capabilities needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important for them today.\n\nStore Experience. Our stores remain the hub of our business, and we are investing to improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and increasing the convenience and speed of checkout. For several years, our associates have used web-enabled handheld devices we call 'GET phones' to help expedite the online order checkout process, locate products in the aisles and online, and check inventory on hand. To improve the customer's experience in our stores, we have also empowered our customers with additional self-help tools, including mobile app-enabled store navigation. Our app provides store-specific maps, which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we leveraged the investments made in our stores over the past several years to operate effectively in the dynamic environment we faced throughout the year. These investments include our wayfinding sign and store refresh package in all of our U.S. stores; our self-service lockers, online order storage areas at front entrances, and curbside pickup, which offer convenient pickup options for online orders; electronic shelf label capabilities; and the re-design of the front-end area, including reconfigured service desks, improved layouts in all checkout areas, and expanded and enhanced self-checkout options. We believe these investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, and we will continue to invest to improve the customer experience going forward.\n\nInvesting in Associate Productivity. We continually strive to improve our store operations for our associates. Our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. To this end, we have continued to focus our efforts in such areas as optimizing product flow to decrease the amount of time a store associate spends locating product and to improve on-shelf product availability; creating a simpler order management system; expanding in-aisle, real-time mobile learning tools for our associates' own development and to assist with customer questions; and using labor model tools to better align associate activity with customer needs.\n\nInvesting in Safety. We are committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates. We empower trained EH&amp;S associates to evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EH&amp;S policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate's role and responsibilities; and awareness,",

      "question": "How does Starbucks' allocation of goodwill to its International segment compare with Amazon's asset distribution in its International segment, and what does this suggest about their different approaches to international expansion?",
      "answer": "Starbucks allocates a significant portion of its total goodwill to the International segment, with $2,788.5 million (or approximately 84% of total goodwill) attributed to it as of September 29, 2024. This reflects a strong emphasis on international markets, particularly the China reporting unit, as a core growth driver. In contrast, Amazon's International segment holds assets primarily in property and equipment, operating leases, inventory, and digital content, indicating a more capital-intensive and operationally distributed approach to international markets. Unlike Starbucks, which capitalizes goodwill from acquisitions and market-specific brand development, Amazon's asset composition suggests a focus on infrastructure and direct-to-consumer capabilities abroad. This highlights a fundamental difference: Starbucks relies heavily on goodwill from localized brand strength and acquisitions, while Amazon invests in tangible and digital infrastructure to scale its international operations.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

In contrast, GM includes engineering expenses as part of its Automotive segment expenses, categorized under operational expenditures such as material and logistics, manufacturing, and professional services, and recognized in segment expenses rather than as a separate liability.

          "chunk_text": "## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, ex pected term and ex pected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and ex pected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax  assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax  assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, ex cess tax  benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of ex isting temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future tax able income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.",

      "question": "How does SBUX's absence of intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2023 affect its operating profit growth potential relative to BKNG's 2023 operating profit performance, given PEP's experience showing prior-year impairments can positively impact year-over-year profit growth?",
      "answer": "SBUX recorded no intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2023, which removes a potential drag on its operating profit and supports stronger year-over-year growth comparisons. In contrast, BKNG reported expectations for higher operating profit in 2023, but without specific impairment reversals or reductions mentioned, its growth likely reflects operational improvements and foreign exchange hedging strategies. PEP\u2019s 2023 results showed a 5-percentage-point favorable impact on operating profit from prior-year impairment charges, demonstrating how the absence of such charges can enhance profit growth. Therefore, SBUX\u2019s clean impairment history provides a comparative advantage in profit growth visibility versus BKNG, which must offset new investments and talent costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SBUX \u2192 Intangible Asset Impairment: SBUX recorded no intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2023, indicating no negative impact on operating profit from this source.",
        "Hop 2: Intangible Asset Impairment \u2192 Operating Profit: PEP's 2023 results showed a 5-percentage-point favorable impact on operating profit from prior-year impairment charges, highlighting how the absence of such charges can improve year-over-year profit growth.",
        "Hop 3: Operating Profit \u2190 BKNG: BKNG guided for higher operating profit in 2023, but faces pressures from foreign exchange and increased personnel costs, making SBUX's impairment-free position more favorable for stable profit growth."

Similarly, for GM, the weakening Egyptian pound was cited as part of the 'unfavorable Other' factor contributing to a decline in total net sales and revenue. However, while NKE experienced a net increase in adjusted earnings of $18 million due to offsetting factors like market growth in Egypt and other regions, GM's overall net sales and revenue declined, with foreign currency effects being a primary driver of the decrease.",

We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper programs, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to invest in the business through capital expenditures, fund dividend payments, fund any share repurchases, make any required debt payments, and satisfy other contractual obligations through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.\n\nOur material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. See below for additional details regarding these material cash requirements.\n\nIn addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. For fiscal 2022, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis, compared to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2021. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, we paid cash dividends of $7.0 billion to shareholders. In February 2022, we also announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.65 to $1.90 per share. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.",

Amounts due to suppliers that participate in the SCF program may be reflected in cash flows from operating activities or cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business.

Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets.

Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. We may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the use of plastic, or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability. Additionally, if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods, or our competitors respond more effectively, this could have a negative effect on our business. We believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products; successfully develop and introduce new products; price our products appropriately; deliver a satisfactory customer experience; manage our investments in store development, technology, digital engagement, and delivery; and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving certain metrics while adversely affecting others, which could have the overall effect of harming our business. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to E nvironmental, Social, and Governance Matters\n\n## Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nWe recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted above, the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather and water supply quality and availability. These factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change. Climate change may also result in decreased availability, less favorable pricing, or other adverse consequences for non-coffee inputs in our products. In addition to impacts in producing countries, climate change may affect the availability of water in the markets in which we operate and expect to operate and elsewhere in our supply chain, which could have adverse impacts on our business. We operate in 87 markets globally. Our properties and operations may be vulnerable to the various adverse effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause store closures, disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers, and impact our customers and partners, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and incur additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\n\n## Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\n\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of regulators and organizations, including the SEC, the European Union, the Nasdaq Stock Market, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress and state legislatures, which in certain cases may be inconsistent with one another, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, regulators, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social, and governance (commonly referred to as 'ESG') matters and related disclosures and operational regulations. These changing rules, regulations, and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative ex penses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult, and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC's climate-related reporting requirements and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD'), with different implementation dates depending on company size and geographic location, has established extensive ESG-related disclosure requirements based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, including certain assurance obligations. The standards used to identify and collect the information and data required pursuant to the CSRD are still developing and uncertain, and this lack of certainty could result in increased costs related to complying with our reporting obligations under the CSRD and could increase the risk of failing to comply with the CSRD.\n\nWe may also communicate certain initiatives and goals related to environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing, social investments, and other ESG-related matters in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and ex pensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost",

      "answer": "GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques supplemented by management judgment to determine loan loss provisions for retail finance receivables, incorporating economic forecasts like unemployment rates and GDP growth. For its $476 million in other financing at 2023 year-end, this approach would apply given the commercial nature of these receivables. In contrast, Tesla manages credit risk in its financing receivables by reviewing credit applications, contract terms, and credit bureau information at origination, focusing on applicants' ability to pay and creditworthiness. While Tesla doesn't disclose specific provisioning amounts, it maintains allowances based on historical credit losses, current economic trends, and forecasts affecting cash flow collectability.",

      "answer": "Amazon's long-term debt proceeds increased from $27.0 billion in 2021 compared to $17.3 billion in 2020, indicating a more aggressive capital-raising strategy to fund growth initiatives like AWS infrastructure and fulfillment capacity. In contrast, GM Financial, while maintaining access to credit facilities, prioritized capital return through a significant $3.5 billion dividend in 2021, suggesting a more mature capital deployment phase. This highlights a divergence in capital strategy: Amazon is reinvesting heavily through debt issuance, while GM Financial is returning capital to its parent company, GM, which manages global liquidity with over 90% of cash held in North America.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nprimarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(59.6) billion and $(58.2) billion in 2020 and 2021, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $35.0 billion, and $55.4 billion in 2020 and 2021, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion in 2020 and 2021.\n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.1) billion and $6.3 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $17.3 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $18.4 billion and $20.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $11.6 billion and $7.1 billion in 2020 and 2021, reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS.\n\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility, $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs, and $803 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility (the 'Credit Facility') as of December 31, 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $7.6 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nTax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2019 and a partial election for 2020 and 2021. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion for 2020 and 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which will delay the deductibility of these expenses and potentially increase the amount of cash taxes we pay.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $257 million and $260 million. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' and 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\n\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We expect to fund the acquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash on hand.\n\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.",

Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2021. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.\n\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed  securities.  Our  investment  guidelines,  which  we  may  change  from  time  to  time,  prescribe  certain  minimum  credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.\n\nWe use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the total size of our credit facilities was $18.5 billion, which consisted principally of four revolving credit facilities. In April 2021, we increased the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $10.5 billion facility to $11.2 billion and extended the termination date for a $9.9 billion portion of the five-year facility by three years, now set to mature on April 18, 2026. The termination date of April 18, 2023 for the remaining portion of the five-year facility remains unchanged. We also renewed and increased the total borrowing capacity of our three-year, $4.0 billion facility to $4.3 billion, which now matures on April 7, 2024, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use by GM Financial, which now matures on April 6, 2022. We also terminated a separate 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into in May 2020. Additionally, the prior restrictions on share repurchases and dividends on our common shares were removed upon entrance into the renewed three-year, $4.3 billion facility. In December 2021, we terminated our three-year, $2.0 billion transformation credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the total size of our credit facilities was $15.5 billion, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities.\n\nIf available capacity permits, GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nSeveral of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2021 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.\n\nGM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $3.5 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.4 billion on its common stock in  2021,  2020,  and  2019.  Current  dividend  levels  are  reflective  of  GM  Financial  earnings  supported  by  strong  residual  values, favorable  credit  performance  and  improved  economic  conditions.  Future  dividends  from  GM  Financial  will  depend  on  several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

GM Financial's primary uses of cash include interest costs, which are a critical component of its liquidity planning. In contrast, HD capitalizes interest costs related to construction in progress and software development, amortizing these costs over the software's useful life (3\u20137 years), which suggests a more controlled and long-term treatment of interest expenses compared to GM Financial\u2019s direct exposure to market-driven interest cost volatility.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Costs associated with the acquisition and development of software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to seven years. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.\n\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the asset's fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Impairment losses on property and equipment are recorded as a component of SG&amp;A. Impairment charges for long-lived assets were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, or fiscal 2019.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe enter into contractual arrangements for the utilization of certain non-owned assets which are evaluated as finance or operating leases upon commencement, and are accounted for accordingly. Specifically, a contract is or contains a lease when (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract.\n\nWe lease certain retail locations, warehouse and distribution space, office space, equipment, and vehicles. A substantial majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of one to 20 years, typically with the option to extend the leases for five-year terms. Some of our leases may include the option to terminate in less than five years. The",

Since lease receivables are typically collateralized by the leased equipment\u2014as seen in Cisco\u2019s practice\u2014Tesla would recover value through asset repossession in case of default, while Amazon must service its lease liabilities and manage the long-term carrying costs of these assets on its balance sheet.",

Loan receivables have terms of one year to three years on average. Lease receivables represent sales-type leases resulting from the sale of Cisco's and complementary third-party products and are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average.\n\nA summary of our financing receivables is presented as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Home Depot reported a $323 million goodwill increase from acquisitions in fiscal 2022, while Starbucks' Corporate and Other segment had a goodwill balance of just $1.0 million at the end of fiscal 2022, with minimal changes over recent years (e.g., $0.1 million increase in 2021 and a $0.1 million decrease in 2022). This stark contrast suggests that Home Depot has been more actively acquiring businesses that contribute meaningfully to its goodwill, whereas Starbucks has not been making significant acquisitions that impact its Corporate and Other segment, indicating different strategic priorities in their M&A and asset management approaches.",

      "answer": "GM's Chevrolet Bolt recall resulted in a $2.6 billion accrual, which directly reduced its operating profit due to the significant costs associated with the recall remedy and customer satisfaction initiatives. This highlights how product recall liabilities can materially affect financial performance. In contrast, HD strategically ties executive compensation to operating profit targets, as evidenced by performance share awards that depend on achieving average operating profit over a three-year cycle. This demonstrates that while operating profit is a key incentive metric for HD\u2019s leadership, it is also a financial indicator highly susceptible to unexpected costs like those GM incurred, which can jeopardize both profitability and executive alignment mechanisms.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nChevrolet Bolt Recall In July 2021, we initiated a voluntary recall for certain 2017-2019 model year Chevrolet Bolt EV s due to the risk that two manufacturing defects present in the same battery cell could cause a high voltage battery fire in certain of these vehicles. After further investigation into the manufacturing processes at our battery supplier, LG  Energy Solution (LGES), and disassembling battery packs, we determined that the risk of battery cell defects was not confined to the initial recall population. As a result, in August 2021, we expanded the recall to include all 2017-2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt EV  and Chevrolet Bolt Electric Utility V ehicles (EUVs). LG Electronics, Inc. (LGE) and LGES (collectively, LG ), have agreed to reimburse GM for certain costs and expenses associated with the recall. The commercial negotiations with LG  also resolved other commercial matters associated with our Ultium Cells Holdings LLC joint venture with LGES. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, we had accrued a total of $2.6 billion and recognized receivables totaling $1.6 billion in connection with these matters. At December 31, 2024, our remaining accrual for these matters was $0.3 billion.  These charges reflect our current best estimate for the cost of the recall remedy, which includes non-traditional recall remedies provided by GM to enhance customer satisfaction. The actual costs of the recall could be materially higher or lower.\n\nIn addition, putative class actions have been filed against GM in the U.S. and Canada alleging that the batteries contained in the Bolt EV s and EUV s included in the recall population are defective. G M has agreed to settle the U.S. class actions for an immaterial amount and the settlement agreement is pending final court approval.\n\nOpel/Vauxhall Sale In  2017,  we  sold  the  Opel/V aux hall  Business  to  PSA  G roup  (now  Stellantis)  under  a  Master Agreement  (the Agreement).  We also sold the European financing subsidiaries and branches to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. Although the sale reduced our new vehicle presence in Europe, we may still be impacted by actions taken by regulators related to vehicles sold before the sale. General Motors Holdings LLC agreed, on behalf of our wholly owned subsidiary (the Seller), to indemnify Stellantis for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the Agreement and for certain other liabilities, including costs related to certain emissions claims, product liabilities and recalls. We are unable to estimate any reasonably possible material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions either directly or through an indemnification claim from Stellantis. Certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments.\n\nCurrently, various consumer lawsuits have been filed against the Seller and Stellantis in G ermany, the UK, Austria and the Netherlands alleging that Opel and Vauxhall vehicles sold by the Seller violated applicable emissions standards. In addition, we indemnified Stellantis for an immaterial amount for certain recalls that Stellantis has conducted or will conduct, including recalls in certain geographic locations that Stellantis intends to conduct related to Takata inflators in legacy Opel vehicles. We may in the future be required to further indemnify Stellantis relating to its Takata recalls, but we believe such further indemnification to be remote at this time.\n\nEuropean Commission and UK Competition and Markets Authority Matter In March 2022, the European Commission and UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) conducted inspections at the premises of, and sent out formal requests for information to, several companies and associations active in the automotive sector. The investigations concern conduct related to coordination regarding the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life cars and vans, which are considered waste. GM was not the subject of the inspections but has since received requests for information related to activities conducted by Opel, a former subsidiary business we sold to  Stellantis in 2017.  G M has replied to the  European  Commission's and  CMA's requests for information.  The inspections and requests for information are preliminary investigatory steps and do not prejudge the outcome of the investigations, and as of December 31, 2024, we had accrued an immaterial amount related to this matter. If an infringement is established as to Opel's conduct, there are a range of possible outcomes, including fines, which could be material.\n\nPrivacy and Consumer Protection Matters There are putative class actions pending against GM in federal courts in the U.S. alleging violations of state and federal privacy and consumer protection laws related to the collection and use of certain consumer data obtained through our former OnStar Smart Driver product. In June 2024, those class actions were consolidated into a multi-district litigation proceeding in the Northern District of G eorgia. In addition, a number of federal and state agencies and attorneys general have opened investigations or made inquiries of us relating to these alleged consumer protection and privacy issues. The Company is fully cooperating with these agencies and attorneys general. At this stage, we are not able to estimate any reasonably possible or probable material loss or range of loss that may result from these actions.\n\nProduct Liability and Breach of Warranty We record liabilities related to product liability claims in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities for the ex pected cost of all known product liability claims, plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured.

Increasing  attention  to  climate  change,  increasing  societal  expectations  on  companies  to  address climate  change  and  changes  in  consumer  preferences  may  result  in  increased  costs,  reduced  demand  for  our  products,  reduced profits, risks associated with new regulatory requirements and the potential for increased litigation and governmental investigations. Climate  change  regulations  at  the  federal,  state  or  local  level  or  in  international  jurisdictions  could  require  us  to  further  limit emissions associated with customer use of products we sell, change our manufacturing processes or product portfolio or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material. These requirements may increase the cost of, and/or  diminish  demand  for,  our  ICE  vehicles.  See  'Our  operations  and  products  are  subject  to  extensive  laws,  regulations  and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.'\n\nPart  of  our  strategy  to  address  these  risks  includes  our  transition  to  EVs,  which  presents  additional  risks,  including  reduced demand for, and therefore profits from, our ICE vehicles, which we plan to use to fund our growth strategy; higher costs related to EV technologies impacting profitability compared to ICE vehicles; and risks related to the success of our EV strategy. See 'Our long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of EVs' and 'Our near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks.'\n\nFinally, increased intensity, frequency or duration of storms, droughts or other severe weather events as a result of climate change may disrupt our production and the production, logistics, cost and procurement of products from our suppliers and timely delivery of vehicles to customers, and could negatively impact working conditions at our plants and those of our suppliers. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Risks related to our operations\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high proportion  of  relatively  fixed  structural  costs,  small  changes  in  sales  volume  can  have  a  disproportionately  large  effect  on  our profitability. A  number  of  economic  and  market  conditions  drive  changes  in  new  vehicle  sales,  including  disruptions  in  the  new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability of affordable financing,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  fuel,  consumer  confidence  and  demand  for  vehicles,  political  unrest  or  uncertainty,  the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, including COVID-19, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A. Any significant decrease in new vehicle sales could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nHigh prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices for commodities, raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, nonferrous  metals,  critical  minerals  or  other  similar  raw  materials,  or  increases  in  logistics  and  related  costs,  may  lead  to  higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, any increase in the cost of critical materials for our EV propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EVs and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. Geopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic and political factors may continue  to  create  pricing  pressure  for  commodities,  raw  materials  and  other  inputs.  These  inflationary  pressures  could,  in  turn, negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\nOur  business  in  China  subjects  us  to  unique  operational,  competitive  and  regulatory  risks. Pursuing  opportunities  in  the Chinese market is an important component of our global growth strategy. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as non-traditional market participants, such as domestic technology companies. In addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EVs, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions or weakening economic conditions in China, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.\n\nCertain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates the scope of our investments and business conducted within China. In order to maintain access to the Chinese market, we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the Chinese market, at times with challenging lead times. These actions may increase the cost of doing business in China or",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.",

      "answer": "Amazon explicitly states that it is 'not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate' due to fixed expenses and unpredictable demand, which creates challenges in aligning spending with sales estimates. In contrast, Booking Holdings reported a 17.1% increase in room nights from 896 million in 2022 to 1,049 million in 2023, showing a quantifiable upward trend in a core metric. This measurable growth in room nights provides Booking with a more tangible indicator of business performance compared to Amazon's acknowledged forecasting difficulties.

      "answer": "Amazon's International segment faces material foreign exchange risk, where a 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change in exchange rates could lead to losses of $320 million, $640 million, and $1.3 billion, respectively, on intercompany balances. These fluctuations can distort reported earnings and financial metrics across borders. Starbucks holds a substantial goodwill balance in its International segment, which stood at $2,691.1 million as of October 1, 2023, and is subject to impairment reviews that consider economic conditions and currency effects. Therefore, persistent foreign exchange volatility could weaken the financial performance of Starbucks' International segment, increasing the likelihood of goodwill impairment as the recoverable amount of the segment's assets may fall below carrying value.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 International Segment: Amazon's International segment is significantly exposed to foreign exchange risk, with intercompany balance losses of up to $1.3 billion under a 20% adverse rate movement.",
        "Hop 2: International Segment \u2192 Goodwill Balance: The International segment's financial performance is tied to goodwill, which is subject to impairment if economic conditions deteriorate or currency effects weigh on results.",
        "Hop 3: Goodwill Balance \u2190 SBUX: Starbucks reports a $2,691.1 million goodwill balance in its International segment as of October 1, 2023, making it vulnerable to impairment from external financial shocks like foreign exchange volatility."

This implies a significant tax risk if the company chooses to bring those funds back for domestic liquidity needs. In contrast, Home Depot held $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents at its foreign subsidiaries as of January 30, 2022, and while it also faces potential foreign withholding taxes on repatriation, its disclosures suggest a more confident stance on liquidity sufficiency without explicitly highlighting material tax risk. Both companies are subject to foreign withholding taxes, but Starbucks emphasizes the materiality of the potential tax impact, whereas Home Depot does not frame it as a major constraint on repatriation decisions.",

We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper programs, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to invest in the business through capital expenditures, fund dividend payments, fund any share repurchases, make any required debt payments, and satisfy other contractual obligations through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.\n\nOur material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. See below for additional details regarding these material cash requirements.\n\nIn addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. For fiscal 2022, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis, compared to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2021. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, we paid cash dividends of $7.0 billion to shareholders. In February 2022, we also announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.65 to $1.90 per share.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncompetition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies, in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. We may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the use of plastic, or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability. Additionally, if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods, or our competitors respond more effectively, this could have a negative effect on our business. We believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products; successfully develop and introduce new products; price our products appropriately; deliver a satisfactory customer experience; manage our investments in store development, technology, digital engagement, and delivery; and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving certain metrics while adversely affecting others, which could have the overall effect of harming our business. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to E nvironmental, Social, and Governance Matters\n\n## Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nWe recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted above, the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather and water supply quality and availability. These factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change. Climate change may also result in decreased availability, less favorable pricing, or other adverse consequences for non-coffee inputs in our products. In addition to impacts in producing countries, climate change may affect the availability of water in the markets in which we operate and expect to operate and elsewhere in our supply chain, which could have adverse impacts on our business. We operate in 87 markets globally. Our properties and operations may be vulnerable to the various adverse effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause store closures, disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers, and impact our customers and partners, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and incur additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\n\n## Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\n\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of regulators and organizations, including the SEC, the European Union, the Nasdaq Stock Market, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress and state legislatures, which in certain cases may be inconsistent with one another, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, regulators, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social, and governance (commonly referred to as 'ESG') matters and related disclosures and operational regulations. These changing rules, regulations, and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative ex penses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult, and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC's climate-related reporting requirements and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD'), with different implementation dates depending on company size and geographic location, has established extensive ESG-related disclosure requirements based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, including certain assurance obligations. The standards used to identify and collect the information and data required pursuant to the CSRD are still developing and uncertain, and this lack of certainty could result in increased costs related to complying with our reporting obligations under the CSRD and could increase the risk of failing to comply with the CSRD.\n\nWe may also communicate certain initiatives and goals related to environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing, social investments, and other ESG-related matters in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and ex pensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost",

Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business.\n\nCorporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2022, or 7%, compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2021. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($84 million), increased support costs to address labor market conditions ($36 million) and increased partner wages and benefits ($31 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($62 million).\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## Cash and Investment Overview\n\nOur cash and investments were $3.5 billion and $6.9 billion as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of October 2, 2022, approximately $2.7 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Borrowing capacity\n\n## Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper\n\nOur total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $2.8 billion as of the end of fiscal 2022.\n\n## Revolving Lines of Credit\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the '2021 credit facility'), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The 'Base Rate' of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America's prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1.000%. As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings under the 2021 credit facility.\n\n## Commercial Paper\n\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the",

Most of the secured debt was issued by VIEs and is repayable only from proceeds related to the underlying pledged assets. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on GM Financial's involvement with VIEs. GM Financial is required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional collateral for borrowings under certain secured credit facilities. The weighted-average interest rate on secured debt was 1.27% at December 31, 2021. The revolving credit facilities have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2027 and securitization notes payable have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2034. At the end of the revolving period, if not renewed, the debt of revolving credit facilities  will  amortize  over  a  defined  period.  In  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  GM  Financial  renewed  revolving  credit facilities with total borrowing capacity of $25.8 billion and issued $23.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of securitization notes payable with an initial weighted average interest rate of 0.79% and maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2034.\n\nUnsecured debt consists of senior notes, credit facilities and other unsecured debt. Senior notes outstanding at December 31, 2021 have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2031 and have a weighted-average interest rate of 2.77%. In the year ended December 31, 2021, GM Financial issued $12.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an initial weighted average interest rate of 1.62% and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2031.\n\nIn September 2021, GM Financial redeemed $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.2% senior notes due in 2023. The redemption  resulted  in  a  $105  million  loss  on  the  early  extinguishment  of  debt.  The  loss  is  included  in  GM  Financial  interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nIn January 2022, GM Financial issued $2.6 billion in senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.57% and maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2032.\n\nUnsecured credit facilities and other unsecured debt have original maturities of up to four years. The weighted-average interest rate on these credit facilities and other unsecured debt was 2.69% at December 31, 2021.\n\n",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "NKE's international operations generated a $132 million favorable impact on pre-tax income in fiscal 2022 due to foreign currency effects.

Meanwhile, HD reported a $323 million increase in goodwill during fiscal 2021, primarily from acquisitions, indicating a different international growth strategy focused on expansion rather than organic performance.

      "question": "How does Tesla's approach to provisioning its $207 million long-term government rebates receivable compare to Amazon's handling of expected credit losses on its $17.4 billion video and music content portfolio, given the relationship between allowance for loan losses and expected credit losses?",
      "answer": "Tesla maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover expected credit losses on its financing receivables, which include automotive and energy product loans to customers. Tesla specifically notes that provisions are made based on historical losses, economic trends, and forecasts affecting collectability, though it does not specify a direct percentage or figure for its allowance relative to the $207 million long-term government rebates receivable. The allowance reflects expected credit losses over the life of the loans. In contrast, Amazon explicitly records expected credit losses as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' and applies this to its $17.4 billion video and music content portfolio, where impairments are evaluated based on fair value and expected usage/viewing patterns. Both companies rely on the concept of expected credit losses, but Tesla focuses on customer financing while Amazon applies it to investment-grade debt securities and content monetization strategies.",

        "Hop 2: Allowance for Loan Losses \u2192 Expected Credit Losses: The allowance for loan losses is directly tied to expected credit losses, which are estimated using lifetime forecasts and are used to carry the loan at net realizable value.",

          "chunk_text": "## Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\n\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including beginning construction of our Megafactory in Lathrop, California, but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest, and we are emphasizing crossselling with our residential solar energy products. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof by on-boarding and training new installers, as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\n\n## Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products in the new Model S and Model X, Megapack and Solar Roof, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years.\n\nOur business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as our stock price has significantly increased, we have seen higher levels of early conversions of 'in-themoney' convertible senior notes, which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\n## Operating Expense Trends\n\nAs long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded approximately $101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ('GAAP'). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.",

      "answer": "MCD reported total charges of $273.7 million in 2023, a significant decrease from $770.7 million in 2022, indicating a reduction in one-time costs and potentially a more stable operational environment. In contrast, GM's Cruise segment recorded $529 million in charges in 2023, including $212 million in supplier-related charges and $67 million in employee separation costs, primarily due to the voluntary pause in its autonomous vehicle operations. These figures suggest that while MCD was largely managing a declining level of exceptional costs, Cruise was actively restructuring and incurring significant charges related to strategic operational adjustments. This divergence highlights MCD\u2019s focus on cost containment and operational efficiency versus Cruise\u2019s need to reallocate resources in response to strategic and operational challenges in its AV program.",

        "Hop 1: MCD \u2192 Charges: MCD disclosed $273.7 million in charges for 2023, down from $770.7 million in 2022, showing a substantial reduction in one-time financial burdens.",

      "answer": "GM reports that engineering is a significant component of its automotive segment expenses, which include material and logistics, manufacturing, equity income, people-related costs, advertising, information technology, professional services, and warranty. Tesla, in contrast, discloses that its warranty reserve is a major accrued liability tied to its automotive segment, with costs estimated based on historical claims and projected future claims. While GM allocates engineering costs upfront in product development, Tesla's warranty exposure reflects longer-term post-sale financial commitments. This suggests GM bears more immediate R&D and development risk, whereas Tesla faces extended liability tied to vehicle reliability and service performance over time.",

          "chunk_text": "## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, ex pected term and ex pected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and ex pected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax  assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax  assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, ex cess tax  benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of ex isting temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future tax able income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.",

      "question": "How might Tesla's reliance on volume growth rather than pricing power for its 17% automotive sales revenue increase in 2023 align with broader industry challenges in leveraging price increases for growth, as seen in another company's 1.0% core pricing contribution, and what uncertainties does this create for companies like Lowe's that guide based on projected sales growth?",
      "answer": "Tesla's 17% automotive sales revenue growth in 2023 was driven primarily by a 473,382-unit increase in Model 3 and Model Y deliveries, despite lower average selling prices due to price reductions and foreign exchange impacts. This reflects a volume-dependent growth strategy. This aligns with broader industry dynamics where pricing power appears constrained, as evidenced by another company\u2019s disclosure that price increases contributed only 1.0% to its 2023 sales growth. For companies like Lowe's, which explicitly guides based on projected sales growth in its forward-looking statements, this limited pricing power introduces uncertainty, particularly if they rely on price increases to meet growth targets in a competitive or macroeconomically volatile environment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TSLA \u2192 Average Selling Price: Tesla's 2023 automotive sales revenue growth of 17% was partially offset by lower average selling prices due to price reductions and FX impacts, highlighting a volume-driven growth strategy.",
        "Hop 2: Average Selling Price \u2192 Sales Growth: Another company reported that price increases contributed just 1.0% to its sales growth, indicating limited pricing power across the industry.",
        "Hop 3: Sales Growth \u2190 LOW: Lowe's includes sales growth as a key forward-looking metric in its guidance, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, especially in environments where pricing power is constrained."

However, despite this sales growth, Amazon\u2019s North America operating income decreased in 2021 due to higher shipping and fulfillment costs, which were exacerbated by increased wage rates, incentives, and carrier rates, even though these were partially offset by the growth in third-party seller and advertising revenues.",

Revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven by higher revenues in EMEA, North America and APLA, partially offset by lower revenues in Greater China. Higher revenues in EMEA and North America each contributed approximately 3 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, and APLA contributed approximately 2 percentage points, while lower revenues in Greater China reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 4% for fiscal 2022, driven by growth in NIKE Direct, partially offset by a decline in our wholesale business. Unit sales of footwear decreased 3%, while higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct ASP, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven primarily by growth in Men's. Unit sales of apparel remained flat, and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nOn a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 42% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022 compared to 39% for fiscal 2021. NIKE Brand Digital sales were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to $9.1 billion for fiscal 2021. On a currencyneutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2022, driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 18%, comparable store sales growth of 10%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2022 NIKE Brand revenue growth of 6% was primarily driven by increases in Men's and the Jordan Brand, which grew 3% and 7%, respectively.",

      "question": "How does Tesla's exposure to residual value risk in its vehicle leasing program compare to GM's reliance on GM Financial's residual value estimates, given GM Financial's $29.1 billion estimated residual value of leased vehicles as of December 31, 2021?",
      "answer": "Tesla manages residual value risk in its leasing program by depreciating leased vehicles to residual value over the lease term using a straight-line method, with a total gross cost of $5.28 billion in operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2021. GM Financial, on the other hand, estimates residual values at lease inception based on third-party data and market conditions, with an estimated residual value of $29.1 billion for its leased vehicles as of December 31, 2021. A decline in used vehicle prices could lead to higher depreciation or impairment charges for GM Financial, which would in turn impact GM's ability to provide competitive financing and leasing options to customers. Both companies are exposed to residual value risk, but Tesla's exposure is internal and tied to its own leasing portfolio, while GM's exposure is indirect through GM Financial and more sensitive to broader market fluctuations.",

          "chunk_text": "## MyPower Customer Notes Receivable\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $299 million and $334 million, respectively, of which $11 million and $9 million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for expected credit losses was $41 million and $45 million, respectively.\n\n## Concentration of Risk\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.\n\n## Supply Risk\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Operating Lease Vehicles\n\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $5.28 billion and $3.54 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $773 million and $446 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Digital Assets, Net\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased an aggregate of $1.50 billion in bitcoin (a \"digital asset\") and briefly accepted bitcoin as a payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions, subject to applicable laws. We account for such non-cash consideration at the time we enter into transactions with our customers in accordance with the non-cash consideration guidance included in the Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC') 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , based on the then current quoted market prices of the digital assets.",

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "HD generally includes fixed real estate tax obligations in the measurement of lease liabilities when they are determinable, while MCD faces variable rent escalations often tied to real estate tax increases, which are not fixed at lease inception. This reveals that HD seeks to stabilize long-term lease costs by locking in known tax expenses upfront, whereas MCD accepts more variable exposure in exchange for potentially lower initial rent. The link between real estate taxes and rent escalations, as seen in the filings, shows that property tax increases directly drive higher lease costs for MCD but do not affect HD if those taxes were already fixed at lease commencement.",

The divergence can be attributed to AMZN's broader international footprint, diversified product base, and pricing strategies, which allowed it to offset supply chain disruptions through scale and third-party seller growth, while NKE's more brand-specific and regionally imbalanced demand (e.g., declines in Asia) limited its ability to grow unit sales.",

This was partially offset by an increase in federal research and development credits, which included approximately $600 million of tax benefit recorded in 2023 related to a change in the estimated qualifying ex penditures associated with our 2022 U.S. federal R&amp;D credit.\n\nOur provision for income taxes in 2024 was higher than in 2023 primarily due to an increase in pretax income, partially offset by an increase in ex cess tax  benefits from stock-based compensation and an increase in our foreign income deduction.",

      "question": "How does GM Financial's $476 million in other financing in 2023 compare with Tesla's financing receivables strategy in terms of their respective approaches to managing credit risk through allowance for loan losses?",
      "answer": "GM Financial manages credit risk on its $476 million in other financing (as of 2023) by using static pool modeling techniques supplemented by management judgment, incorporating forecasts of economic conditions like unemployment rates and GDP growth. Tesla, on the other hand, evaluates its financing receivables by considering historical credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable forecasts affecting cash flow collectability. While both companies maintain allowances for loan losses, GM Financial emphasizes economic forecasting tailored to regional factors, whereas Tesla focuses on a combination of historical performance and broader economic trends.",

        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 GM Financial: GM depends on GM Financial, which reported $476 million in other financing at the end of 2023.",

      "question": "How did the year-over-year decline in Tesla's average selling price impact EBIT-adjusted performance at General Motors, given the relationship between pricing and earnings metrics in the automotive industry?",
      "answer": "Tesla's average selling price declined year-over-year due to overall price reductions, sales mix, and foreign currency impacts, which indirectly intensified pricing pressure across the automotive industry. At GM, EBIT-adjusted was negatively impacted by $682 million in 2023 compared to 2022, with price changes contributing a $3.2 billion unfavorable variance. Despite GM\u2019s EBIT-adjusted margin being 8.7% in 2023, down from 10.1% in 2022, the broader pricing environment influenced by Tesla likely contributed to margin compression through competitive dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TSLA \u2192 Average Selling Price: Tesla's average selling price declined year-over-year due to price reductions, sales mix, and a stronger US dollar, negatively impacting automotive sales revenue.",
        "Hop 2: Average Selling Price \u2192 EBIT-adjusted: At GM, price changes contributed a $3.2 billion unfavorable variance to net sales, which flowed through to EBIT-adjusted, a key profitability metric.",
        "Hop 3: EBIT-adjusted \u2190 GM: GM reported EBIT-adjusted of $12,306 million in 2023, down $682 million from 2022, with margin declining from 10.1% to 8.7%, indicating pressure on earnings linked in part to pricing trends."

In contrast, NKE experienced a 12% decrease in combined wholesale and direct-to-consumer unit sales, with North America being a key contributor to the decline. The drop was primarily due to reduced wholesale activity and lower consumer traffic, despite increased promotional efforts to drive demand. These opposing trends suggest that while AMZN's value and convenience proposition is resonating with North American consumers, NKE is facing headwinds in the same region, potentially due to shifting consumer preferences or competitive pressures.",

      "question": "How does Home Depot's use of NOPAT in calculating ROIC relate to Lowe's sensitivity of net earnings to inventory reserve estimates, considering the reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings in Home Depot's financial disclosures?",
      "answer": "Home Depot defines NOPAT as a component of its ROIC calculation, which is reconciled to net earnings in its financial disclosures. This reconciliation indicates that NOPAT is a non-GAAP measure closely tied to GAAP net earnings. Lowe's highlights that a 10% change in inventory reserve estimates could affect net earnings by $13 million (obsolete inventory) and $31 million (shrinkage reserve), showing a material sensitivity. Since NOPAT is reconciled to net earnings, any adjustments impacting Lowe's net earnings\u2014such as inventory reserve changes\u2014would also influence metrics derived from NOPAT, like ROIC, if applied similarly. Thus, both companies rely on net earnings as a foundational metric, but Home Depot uses it indirectly through NOPAT for performance analysis, while Lowe's directly ties it to operational assumptions affecting profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $13 million for 2021. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $31 million for 2021.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.  However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective long-term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year.  Adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.\n\n## Long-Lived Asset Impairment\n\n## Description\n\nWe review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  When evaluating locations for impairment, our asset group is at an individual location level, as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable.  Cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead.\n\nWe evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long-lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location's assets may not be recoverable. For operating locations, our primary indicator that assets may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a twelve month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results. Management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment, including individual locations' execution of their operating plans and local market conditions, including incursion, which is the opening of either other Lowe's locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market. We also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n\nA potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location's assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets. The carrying value of a location's asset group includes inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and operating liabilities including inventory payables, salaries payable and operating lease liabilities. Financial and nonoperating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location, management makes assumptions, incorporating local market conditions, about key store variables including sales growth rates, gross margin and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and operating expense, as well as asset residual values or lease rates. Operating lease payments are included in the projected future cash flows. Financing lease payments are excluded from the projected future cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\n\nWe use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations, which requires discounting projected future cash flows. This involves making assumptions regarding both a location's future cash flows, as described above, and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows. We discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows. The selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours.\n\nWe use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure. This involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated. The information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets.",

      "answer": "Nike's Global Brand Divisions saw an increase in advertising and marketing expense as part of a broader strategy to boost demand creation, which contributed to a 2% decrease in its pre-tax loss despite lower wage-related expenses and technology spend. This reflects Nike's focus on strengthening brand visibility and digital engagement globally, particularly in high-growth markets like Greater China and North America, where it reported $7,547 million and $18,353 million in regional revenues, respectively. In contrast, Home Depot maintained a more stable advertising approach, with net advertising expense held relatively flat at $1.2 billion in fiscal 2024, indicating a strategy of sustaining core market presence rather than aggressive brand expansion. The divergence suggests that Nike is prioritizing demand generation through marketing to fuel growth, while Home Depot is focusing on operational efficiency and leveraging its existing brand strength in the home improvement sector.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and serv ices performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from v endors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network. Vendor allowances that are not reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are also included within cost of sales.\n\n## Vendor Allowances\n\nVendor allowances primarily consist of v olume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase lev els and co-op adv ertising allowances for the promotion of v endors' products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase lev els. These v endor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances receiv ed as a result of attaining certain purchase lev els accrued over the incentiv e period, which generally concludes at the end of the calendar year, based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain co-op adv ertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inv entory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inv entory is sold.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrativ e expenses include compensation and benefits for retail and store support center associates, occupancy and operating costs of retail locations and store support centers, insurance-related expenses, adv ertising costs, credit and debit card processing fees, and other administrativ e costs.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs, including digital, telev ision, radio and print, are expensed when the adv ertisement first appears. Certain co-op adv ertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to promote v endors' products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. Net adv ertising expense included in SG&amp;A was $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe are currently authorized to issue incentiv e and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, stock appreciation rights, and deferred shares to certain of our associates and non-employee directors under certain stock incentiv e plans. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to associates and non-employee directors based on estimated fair v alues. The v alue of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to v est is recognized as stock-based compensation expense, on a straight-line basis, ov er the requisite serv ice period or as restrictions lapse. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating stockbased compensation expense. Additional information on our stock-based payment awards is included in Note 9.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We prov ide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes v ersus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respectiv e tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recov ered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely ev aluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a v aluation allowance if, based on all av ailable ev idence, we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.\n\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.\n\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and SG&amp;A, respectiv ely, on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Fiscal 2024 Form  10-K",

      "answer": "Starbucks' International segment goodwill declined from $3,148.3 million in 2021 to $2,756.7 million in 2022, a decrease of $391.6 million, indicating potential impairments or strategic exits in international markets. In contrast, Lowe's 2022 goodwill balance remained flat at $311 million, showing no acquisitions and stable asset valuations.

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

      "answer": "Starbucks experienced a $97.4 million increase in its international goodwill balance from fiscal year 2023 ($2,691.1 million) to fiscal year 2024 ($2,788.5 million). This significant goodwill concentration in the international segment heightens exposure to potential impairment risks if future performance expectations are not met. McDonald's international segment disclosures highlight several risks\u2014including franchising disputes, supplier conflicts, employment-related litigation, and regulatory challenges\u2014that could negatively impact international operations. If Starbucks faces similar risks in its international markets, it could lead to financial underperformance in those regions, increasing the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Therefore, the growth in international goodwill coincides with exposure to operational and legal risks that could trigger impairment charges if international performance deteriorates.",

      "question": "How does The Home Depot's use of NOPAT in calculating ROIC reflect on its net earnings performance, and how might this financial dynamic differently impact Starbucks' cash flow from operations given its sensitivity to net earnings fluctuations?",
      "answer": "The Home Depot defines ROIC as NOPAT divided by average debt and equity, with NOPAT being a non-GAAP measure derived from net earnings. In fiscal 2022, Starbucks reported that lower net earnings directly reduced cash flow from operations, which fell to $4.4 billion from $6.0 billion in fiscal 2021. This indicates that while HD uses NOPAT as a lens to assess capital efficiency tied to net earnings, SBUX experiences a more direct financial impact where net earnings volatility\u2014such as from commodity price risk\u2014immediately affects operational cash flow.",

However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\n\nReturn on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.\n\nThe following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure):\n\n",

(1)\n\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 99% of total purchase obligations. (2)\n\nOther obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term income taxes payable, asset retirement obligations and equity investment capital commitments. (3)\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.4 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $6.0 billion for fiscal 2021. The change was primarily due to lower net earnings and an increase in inventory purchases and timing of income tax payments.\n\nCash used in investing activities totaled $2.1 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $0.3 billion for fiscal 2021. The change was primarily driven by lapping the net proceeds from the divestiture of our ownership interest in our South Korea joint venture and an increase in spend on capital expenditures.\n\nCash used in financing activities for fiscal 2022 totaled $5.6 billion, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $3.7 billion for fiscal 2021. The change was primarily due to resuming our share repurchase program, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt.\n\n## COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS\n\nCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and speculative trading activities are prohibited. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in Japan. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.",

      "answer": "Tesla's automotive regulatory credits in 2021 were $1,465 million, contributing approximately 3.1% to its total automotive revenue of $47,232 million. In comparison, GM's automotive segment revenue in 2020 was $108,669 million. This indicates that while Tesla's regulatory credits were a small but notable part of its automotive revenue, GM's automotive segment revenue was significantly larger in scale.",

      "question": "How did the $105 million loss from early debt extinguishment at GM Financial in 2021 impact GM's automotive financing strategy, and how does this compare to BKNG's experience with early debt redemption in the same year in terms of effects on liquidity and capital structure?",
      "answer": "GM's reliance on GM Financial for automotive financing was directly impacted by the $105 million loss from early extinguishment of 5.2% senior notes in 2021, which increased interest and other expenses for GM Financial and constrained its capital availability for customer leasing and dealer financing. This affected GM's broader strategy to support vehicle sales through competitive financing offers. Similarly, BKNG incurred a loss from the early redemption of its Senior Notes due in April 2025 and April 2027 in 2021, which also affected its capital structure. While both companies experienced liquidity pressures from these early redemptions, GM's impact was more directly tied to its automotive financing arm's operational capacity, whereas BKNG's loss reflected strategic refinancing decisions amid shifting market conditions.",

        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 GM Financial: GM depends on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and dealers, making GM Financial's financial health and cost of capital critical to GM's sales strategy.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "question": "How does the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on NIKE's product costs compare to Tesla's exposure through costs and expenses, considering both companies' operational structures and risk management strategies?",
      "answer": "NIKE faces foreign currency exposure primarily through product costs due to U.S. Dollar-denominated purchases from third-party factories and the NTC, which increases inventory costs when the U.S. Dollar strengthens. In contrast, Tesla notes that a portion of its costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, and if not fully offset by revenues in those currencies, a weaker U.S. Dollar would increase these costs as a percentage of revenue. Both companies acknowledge foreign currency as a risk to costs, but NIKE actively manages this exposure using a foreign currency adjustment program with factories and currency derivatives, while Tesla focuses on hedging strategies to mitigate exposure related to localized subsidiary debt and operational costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE \u2192 Foreign Currency Impact: NIKE's product costs are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, particularly through U.S. Dollar-denominated purchases, which increase inventory costs when the U.S. Dollar strengthens.",
        "Hop 2: Foreign Currency Impact \u2192 Costs and Expenses: Foreign currency movements can increase costs and expenses, as seen in CMCSA's Sky operations in Germany, where a stronger U.S. Dollar led to higher reported costs.",
        "Hop 3: Costs and Expenses \u2190 TSLA: Tesla notes that a portion of its costs and expenses are in foreign currencies, and without offsetting revenues, a weaker U.S. Dollar would increase these costs as a percentage of revenue, impacting margins."

      "answer": "Lowe\u2019s advertising expense was 1.10% of net sales in FY2025, up from 0.96% in FY2024, indicating a growing but still relatively modest investment in advertising. In contrast, advertising is explicitly listed as a key component of Automotive Segment expenses for General Motors, grouped alongside major cost categories like material and logistics, manufacturing, and engineering. This suggests that advertising plays a more structurally significant role in GM\u2019s Automotive Segment compared to LOW\u2019s overall business, reflecting the differing marketing intensity required in automotive sales versus home improvement retail.",

        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 Automotive Segment: GM\u2019s Automotive Segment includes advertising as a core expense category alongside major operational costs like manufacturing and logistics, signaling its strategic importance in automotive operations.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "Starbucks' Other Revenues grew by 64.1% between 2020 and 2021, while General Motors' fleet sales accounted for 11.3% of total vehicle sales in 2021. This suggests Starbucks was experiencing significant momentum in its diversified revenue streams, such as packaged coffee and licensing, during the recovery, whereas GM was managing a strategic shift toward retail sales as fleet sales declined as a percentage of total sales.",

        "Hop 1: SBUX \u2192 Other Revenues: Starbucks' Other Revenues increased from $2,433 million in 2020 to $3,992 million in 2021, representing a 64.1% growth rate, driven by sales of packaged coffee, tea, and ready-to-drink products as well as licensing revenue from Nestl\u00e9.",
        "Hop 2: Other Revenues \u2192 2021: The 64.1% increase in Other Revenues was a key growth driver for Starbucks in 2021, particularly as the company navigated recovery from pandemic-related disruptions.",
        "Hop 3: 2021 \u2190 GM: In 2021, GM reported that fleet sales accounted for 11.3% of total vehicle sales, down from 12.4% in 2020 and 16.1% in 2019, indicating a strategic shift toward retail customers during the same recovery period."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Loyalty Program\n\nCustomers in the U.S., Canada and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program, which is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points ('Stars') in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit cards. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country.\n\nWe defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months.\n\nWhen a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue.\n\n## Other Revenues\n\nOther revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms.\n\nOther revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestl\u00e9 related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestl\u00e9 are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales.\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods and packaging costs as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $416.7 million, $305.1 million and $258.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

      "answer": "NKE experienced a 6% decrease in combined unit sales in fiscal 2022 despite a 12% increase in ASP (average selling price), indicating reduced demand elasticity at higher price points. AMZN noted that its unit sales growth was driven by 'continued efforts to reduce prices,' suggesting that consumers respond positively to lower prices. BKNG, which has called out price sensitivity in consumer travel behavior, specifically notes that 'consumers traveling from a country whose currency has weakened... may book lower ADR accommodations,' which could imply that price reductions may increase booking volume. However, BKNG also states that 'fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates' and 'announcements... of price reductions' are among the factors affecting its stock price volatility. Therefore, while price cuts might boost demand, they could also heighten BKNG's stock volatility, especially if such moves signal strategic shifts or margin pressures.",

GM Financial, on the other hand, reported an estimated residual value of $29.1 billion for its leased vehicles as of December 31, 2021. Both companies are sensitive to changes in residual value assumptions, with Tesla adjusting depreciation over the lease term based on residual estimates and GM Financial noting that a 1% change in residual value estimates could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of its portfolio.

          "chunk_text": "## MyPower Customer Notes Receivable\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $299 million and $334 million, respectively, of which $11 million and $9 million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for expected credit losses was $41 million and $45 million, respectively.\n\n## Concentration of Risk\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.\n\n## Supply Risk\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Operating Lease Vehicles\n\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $5.28 billion and $3.54 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $773 million and $446 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Digital Assets, Net\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased an aggregate of $1.50 billion in bitcoin (a \"digital asset\") and briefly accepted bitcoin as a payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions, subject to applicable laws. We account for such non-cash consideration at the time we enter into transactions with our customers in accordance with the non-cash consideration guidance included in the Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC') 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , based on the then current quoted market prices of the digital assets.",

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

In contrast, GM funds its postretirement medical benefits primarily from corporate assets and plan trusts, with $351 million contributed to U.S. OPEB plans in 2021, indicating a reliance on both dedicated trust funds and general corporate resources for long-term employee obligations. The UPS evidence clarifies that such benefit payments are typically funded through a combination of plan trusts and corporate assets, aligning with GM's observed funding structure.

Certain  other  non-U.S. subsidiaries  have  postretirement  benefit  plans,  although  most  non-U.S.  employees  are  covered  by  government  sponsored  or administered programs. We made contributions to the U.S. OPEB plans of $351 million, $343 million and $326 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Plan participants' contributions were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans We have defined contribution  plans  for  eligible  U.S.  salaried  and  hourly  employees  that  provide discretionary  matching  contributions.  Contributions  are  also  made  to  certain  non-U.S.  defined  contribution  plans.  We  made contributions to our defined contribution plans of $606 million, $573 million and $537 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Significant Plan Amendments, Benefit Modifications and Related Events\n\nOther  Remeasurements The  SOA  issued  mortality  improvement  tables  in  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021  and December  31,  2020.  We  reviewed  our  recent  mortality  experience  and  we  determined  our  current  mortality  assumptions  are appropriate to measure our U.S. pension and OPEB plans obligations as of December 31, 2021. In 2020, we incorporated the SOA mortality improvement tables into our December 31, 2020 measurement of U.S. pension and OPEB plans' benefit obligations. The change in these assumptions decreased U.S. pension and OPEB plans' obligations by $686 million as of December 31, 2020.",

      "answer": "Starbucks' Channel Development segment has maintained a consistent goodwill balance of $34.7 million from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, indicating a stable strategic position within the company's broader portfolio. In contrast, Home Depot has seen significant goodwill increases, with $11,025 million attributed to acquisitions in fiscal 2025 alone, reflecting a more aggressive expansion and diversification strategy. This contrast suggests that while Starbucks is maintaining a steady approach within its Channel Development segment, Home Depot is actively reshaping its business through acquisitions, which are directly contributing to substantial changes in its goodwill balance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncompetition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies, in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. We may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the use of plastic, or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability. Additionally, if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods, or our competitors respond more effectively, this could have a negative effect on our business. We believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products; successfully develop and introduce new products; price our products appropriately; deliver a satisfactory customer experience; manage our investments in store development, technology, digital engagement, and delivery; and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving certain metrics while adversely affecting others, which could have the overall effect of harming our business. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to E nvironmental, Social, and Governance Matters\n\n## Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nWe recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted above, the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather and water supply quality and availability. These factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change. Climate change may also result in decreased availability, less favorable pricing, or other adverse consequences for non-coffee inputs in our products. In addition to impacts in producing countries, climate change may affect the availability of water in the markets in which we operate and expect to operate and elsewhere in our supply chain, which could have adverse impacts on our business. We operate in 87 markets globally. Our properties and operations may be vulnerable to the various adverse effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause store closures, disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers, and impact our customers and partners, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and incur additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\n\n## Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\n\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of regulators and organizations, including the SEC, the European Union, the Nasdaq Stock Market, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress and state legislatures, which in certain cases may be inconsistent with one another, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, regulators, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social, and governance (commonly referred to as 'ESG') matters and related disclosures and operational regulations. These changing rules, regulations, and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative ex penses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult, and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC's climate-related reporting requirements and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD'), with different implementation dates depending on company size and geographic location, has established extensive ESG-related disclosure requirements based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, including certain assurance obligations. The standards used to identify and collect the information and data required pursuant to the CSRD are still developing and uncertain, and this lack of certainty could result in increased costs related to complying with our reporting obligations under the CSRD and could increase the risk of failing to comply with the CSRD.\n\nWe may also communicate certain initiatives and goals related to environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing, social investments, and other ESG-related matters in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and ex pensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost",

      "answer": "GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment due to declining fair value driven by market conditions in China. This impairment reflects the use of Level 3 fair value inputs such as discounted cash flows and long-term growth assumptions. GM Financial also disclosed that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges are recorded directly in earnings. This parallels McDonald's approach where changes in the fair value of undesignated derivatives\u2014such as equity contracts hedging benefit plan liabilities\u2014are immediately recognized in earnings, specifically in Selling, general & administrative expenses. However, while GM Financial\u2019s impairment is tied to a specific investment and market-specific assumptions, McDonald's use of fair value changes is more operational, tied to internal risk management strategies like benefit plan liabilities and foreign currency exposures.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

          "chunk_text": "## Net Investment Hedges\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency denominated debt (third-party and intercompany) and foreign currency derivatives to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. A s of December 31, 2024, $13.1 billion of the Company's third-party foreign currency denominated debt, $168 million of the Company's intercompany foreign currency denominated debt and $1.9 billion of foreign currency derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.\n\n## Undesignated Hedges\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. Therefore, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A s an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. The Company may also use certain investments to hedge changes in these liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives or investments are recorded in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in non-operating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2024 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in its financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. A t December 31, 2024, the Company was required to post $21 million of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company has a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') to employees and nonemployee directors.\n\nShare-based compensation, which includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value, is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses.\n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. In addition, the Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized each period.\n\nThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company's stock at date of grant. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a M onte Carlo valuation model.\n\nRefer to the Share-based Compensation footnote on page 63 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION\n\nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2024-3.6; 2023-4.4; 2022-4.8. Share-based compensation awards that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutiv e were (in millions of shares): 2024-1.9; 2023-2.0; 2022-1.5.\n\n## CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nThe Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. A s of December 31, 2024, Cash and equivalents was $1.1 billion of which $451 million consisted of certificates of deposit.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 51",

      "answer": "Nike's engineering efforts are focused on product innovation in footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment, with dedicated teams in biomechanics, chemistry, and digital technologies driving the development of proprietary technologies like Nike Air, Zoom, and Flyknit. These innovations are central to Nike's product differentiation and environmental impact reduction strategies. In contrast, General Motors allocates engineering expenses as part of its broader Automotive Segment operational costs, which include material logistics, manufacturing, advertising, and policy-related expenditures. Engineering at GM supports vehicle development and strategic shifts, such as the shutdown of its Russia business and Cruise-related activities. While both companies emphasize engineering, Nike's approach is product-centric and innovation-focused, whereas GM integrates engineering within a more complex automotive cost structure that includes manufacturing, compliance, and mobility solutions.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "AMZN's U.S. taxable income in 2024 increased, which positively impacted its FDII deduction, helping to lower its effective U.S. tax rate despite a higher pretax income. MCD, on the other hand, reported an FDII impact of -3.4% on its effective tax rate in 2024, indicating a more pronounced benefit from the FDII deduction compared to AMZN's relative increase in tax provision. This suggests that while both companies leveraged FDII to reduce their U.S. tax burdens, MCD\u2019s tax strategy may have been more optimized for FDII benefits in 2024.",

      "question": "How might Tesla's recognition of $596 million in FSD (Supervised) revenue in 2024 indirectly impact GM Financial's leasing operations, particularly in light of GM's reported $0.3 billion impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment?",
      "answer": "Tesla's recognition of $596 million in FSD (Supervised) revenue in 2024 suggests a shift in automotive value from hardware to software, potentially increasing customer retention of Tesla vehicles due to the ongoing utility provided by FSD features. This could lead to fewer used Tesla vehicles entering the market, tightening supply and increasing residual values. GM Financial, which relies on predictable residual value performance for its leasing operations, may face challenges as market dynamics shift. This concern is compounded by GM Financial\u2019s $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment, which reflects deteriorating conditions in the Chinese automotive financing market and highlights GM Financial\u2019s vulnerability to shifts in vehicle return rates and residual value assumptions. Thus, Tesla\u2019s software-driven revenue model may indirectly pressure GM Financial\u2019s leasing portfolio performance and exacerbate existing impairment risks.",

These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.\n\n## 2024 compared to 2023\n\nAutomotive sales revenue decreased $6.03 billion, or 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions and attractive financing options provided in 2024 as well as mix. Additionally, there was a decrease of approximately 22,000 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately 19,000 deliveries of other models primarily due to our production ramp of Cybertruck. Additionally, we recognized $596 million of FSD (Supervised) revenue due to release of certain features in 2024.",

Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks and uncertainties, including those arising from potential changes in laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business (for example, the IRA and the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development proposals, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards), the possibility of tax controversy related to adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws (for example, with respect to full realization of the incentives contemplated by the IRA), changes in our business or structure and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our tax es owed is for an amount in ex cess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could  impair  its  access  to  capital  and  negatively  affect  its  business  and  operations,  which  in  turn  could  impede  its  ability  to  provide  leasing  and  financing  to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the sufficiency, availability and cost of sources of funding, including credit facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles GM Financial leases to customers; fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates;  competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to  regulation,  supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.\n\nIn addition, GM Financial has certain floating-rate obligations, hedging transactions and floating-rate commercial loans that determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, generally the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. Any uncertainties associated with these benchmark rates may impact GM Financial's ability to manage interest rate risk effectively.\n\nFurther, as an entity operating in the financial services sector, G M Financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires that GM Financial maintain forms, processes, procedures,  controls  and  the  infrastructure  to  support  these  requirements.  Laws  in  the  financial  services  industry  are  designed  primarily  for  the  protection  of consumers. The failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.\n\n## Risks related to defined benefit pension plans\n\nOur  pension  funding  requirements  could  increase  significantly  due  to  a  reduction  in  funded  status  as  a  result  of  a  variety  of  factors,  including  weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates, changes in the level of benefits provided for by the plans, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns. Our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. A detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques supplemented by management judgment to forecast loan losses for retail finance receivables, incorporating region-specific economic indicators such as unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income, and GDP growth rates. For commercial finance receivables, GM Financial relies on historical loss experience and forecasts of auto industry conditions as the primary economic indicator. In contrast, Tesla states it considers historical credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts affecting collectability but does not specify modeling techniques or detailed economic indicators. Tesla also emphasizes credit evaluation at loan origination, focusing on applicants' payment ability, affordability, and credit history, while GM Financial provides more granular detail on its forecasting methodology.",

      "question": "How does the methodology Amazon uses to estimate expected credit losses on its marketable debt securities compare to Tesla's approach for financing receivables, given that both are tied through the concept of allowance for loan losses?",
      "answer": "Amazon evaluates marketable debt securities by estimating expected credit losses and recording an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' if declines in fair value are credit-related, while Tesla uses a net allowance for loan losses tied to financing receivables, factoring in historical credit losses, economic trends, and forecasts. Both entities rely on expected credit losses as a key input to their respective allowance calculations, though Tesla specifically ties its allowance to customer financing portfolios, whereas Amazon focuses on investment-grade debt securities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Expected Credit Losses: Amazon records an allowance for expected credit losses on marketable debt securities, recognizing declines in fair value due to credit-related factors, and reports these through 'Other income (expense), net'.",
        "Hop 2: Expected Credit Losses \u2192 Allowance for Loan Losses: Expected credit losses represent the projected losses over the life of a financial instrument and are used to determine the allowance for loan losses, which reflects the carrying value of the asset after accounting for these expected losses.",
        "Hop 3: Allowance for Loan Losses \u2190 TSLA: Tesla maintains an allowance for loan losses on financing receivables, determined by historical credit losses, current economic trends, and forecasts, and adjusts the allowance to cover expected credit losses over the receivables' remaining life."

      "question": "How does the gross carrying amount of 'Other intangible assets' reported by BKNG in 2021 compare to GM's total intangible assets in the same year, and what might this imply about their respective asset composition strategies?",
      "answer": "BKNG reported a gross carrying amount of $2 million for 'Other intangible assets' in 2021, while GM reported total intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of $6,026 million for the same year. This stark difference suggests that GM places significantly more emphasis on intangible assets overall, particularly in categories like brands and technology, whereas BKNG's intangible asset strategy appears more focused on specific categories like trade names and supply agreements, with minimal value attributed to 'Other intangible assets'.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 Gross Carrying Amount: GM reports total intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of $6,026 million as of December 31, 2201.",

      "answer": "Home Depot's goodwill balance increased steadily from $7.126B in FY2021 to $7.449B in FY2022, with $323M in acquisitions contributing to this growth. In contrast, Starbucks saw a significant decline in international segment goodwill, dropping from $3,148.3M in FY2021 to $2,756.7M in FY2022, a decrease of $391.6M. While both companies show international activity, Nike's $132M favorable tax impact from foreign currency-denominated profits suggests active international revenue generation.

      "answer": "NKE discloses that its revenue forecasts are a key unobservable input (Level 3) in fair value estimates, where an increase in revenue forecasts would raise fair market value.

      "answer": "LOW actively manages commodity-related market price volatility by adjusting selling prices, which are influenced by the market price they pay for products and the competitive environment. This suggests a dynamic pricing strategy to offset cost fluctuations. In contrast, MCD's RSU compensation plans are directly tied to the market price of its stock at the grant date, with fair value determined by that price. This indicates that MCD incorporates market volatility into its executive compensation framework rather than seeking to insulate itself from it. Together, these approaches show that LOW mitigates market price risk operationally through pricing, while MCD accepts and embeds that volatility into its long-term incentive structures.",

Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

      "question": "How does Tesla's $115 million increase in professional services costs in 2024 compare with the role of professional services in GM's Automotive Segment expenses, and what does this suggest about their differing operational scaling strategies?",
      "answer": "Tesla reported a $115 million increase in professional services costs as part of its 7% overall rise in SG&A expenses in 2024, signaling a growing reliance on external expertise to support its expanding operations. In contrast, GM includes professional services as one of several cost categories within its Automotive Segment expenses, which also encompass material and logistics, manufacturing, advertising, engineering, and warranty-related items. While GM does not isolate professional services with a specific dollar amount, the integration of these costs into a broader operational framework suggests a more internally managed scaling approach. Tesla\u2019s significant increase in external services implies a more outsourced or consultancy-driven growth model, which could affect margin pressures and long-term cost control differently than GM\u2019s more vertically integrated structure.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "Starbucks' Corporate and Other segment maintained a constant goodwill balance of $1.0 million from fiscal year 2023 to 2024, contributing to a total consolidated goodwill increase of $97.4 million over that period. In contrast, Home Depot reported a significant increase in goodwill, growing from $8,455 million at the end of fiscal year 2024 to $19,475 million by the end of fiscal year 2025, primarily driven by acquisitions like the $11,025 million goodwill addition from ZT Systems. This highlights vastly different goodwill dynamics, with Starbucks showing no change in Corporate and Other segment goodwill while Home Depot experienced substantial goodwill growth due to strategic acquisitions.",

      "answer": "GM defines ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by average net assets, which includes adjustments for automotive debt, pension liabilities, and tax assets. This reflects GM's focus on isolating core capital allocation decisions from one-time or strategic adjustments. HD, on the other hand, calculates ROIC using NOPAT (net operating profit after tax), which is derived from GAAP net earnings but excludes interest expense to focus on operating performance. HD's NOPAT definition emphasizes clarity in operational returns without the influence of financing decisions. These differences reveal that GM prioritizes a more segmented view of capital efficiency tied to strategic asset deployment, while HD emphasizes operational profitability as the foundation for assessing capital returns.",

Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  consolidated diluted  EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares  outstanding-diluted.  Examples  of  income  tax  adjustments  include  the  establishment  or  reversal  of  significant  deferred  tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our  core  operations  on  a  consistent  basis.  ETR-adjusted  is  calculated  as  Income  tax  expense  less  the  income  tax  related  to  the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before  income  taxes  less  adjustments. When  we  provide  an  expected  adjusted  effective  tax  rate,  we  do  not  provide  an  expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  investment  and  capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review  the  liquidity  of  our  automotive  operations  and  to  measure  and  monitor  our  performance  against  our  capital  allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted  automotive  free  cash  flow  as  automotive  operating  cash  flow  from  operations  less  capital  expenditures  adjusted  for management actions.  Management  actions  can  include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\n\nReturn on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.\n\nThe following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure):\n\n",

      "answer": "Tesla reported $1,790 million in automotive regulatory credits, which contributed to its total automotive revenue of $82,419 million in 2023. This segment also included $2,120 million in automotive leasing and $8,319 million in services and other revenue. Meanwhile, GM's Automotive Segment had significant exposure through transactions with GM Financial, indicating a large-scale automotive operations footprint. Therefore, while Tesla's regulatory credits represent a smaller portion of its broader automotive revenue mix, GM's automotive segment appears more operationally complex and interlinked with financing arms.",

In contrast, Home Depot's overall goodwill balance increased from $7,444 million in fiscal 2022 to $8,455 million in fiscal 2023, a rise of $1,011 million.

      "answer": "Unemployment rates directly affect consumer creditworthiness and borrowing capacity, which GM Financial considers when forecasting expected credit losses on its retail finance receivables. GM Financial incorporates unemployment rates, among other economic indicators, into its static pool modeling to determine the allowance for loan losses over the expected remaining life of receivables. A rise in unemployment could increase delinquencies and charge-offs, reducing GM Financial's ability to offer competitive financing, which GM relies on to support vehicle sales. Similarly, HD notes that its financial performance is significantly influenced by unemployment rates, as adverse conditions can reduce consumer confidence and purchasing power, leading to decreased demand for home improvement products and services. Therefore, both companies are exposed to unemployment-related risks\u2014one through financing performance and the other through demand volatility\u2014making their financial outcomes sensitive to macroeconomic labor market shifts.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

We seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers and service providers. If we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a provider of high-quality products and services, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty. In addition, we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing, which is an increasing focus of government regulators as well. All of our suppliers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environment, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. We have a responsible sourcing audit process, but we are also dependent on our suppliers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards and applicable law. Actual, potential or perceived supplier non-compliance could expose us to litigation or governmental enforcement actions, and could result in costly product recalls and other liabilities.\n\n## Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, intellectual property, supplier relations, and reputational risks.\n\nIn addition to other product-related risks discussed in this section, as we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our suppliers' products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses.\n\nWe act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our DIFM customers through professional third-party licensed and insured installers. As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting, and handling of environmental risks, as well as quality of work performed by our third-party installers. We have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and manage customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. However, as we experienced in part with our recent EPA investigation and resulting consent decree in April 2021, if we fail to manage these processes effectively, collect the appropriate documentation, perform regular job site inspections, or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines, lawsuits, or governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as claims for property damage or personal injury. In addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business.\n\n## Legal, Financial, Regulatory, Global and Other External Risks\n\nUncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political and social climate, public health issues, and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance.\n\nOur financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political or social climate could adversely impact our customers' confidence or financial condition, causing them to decide against purchasing home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. Other factors beyond our control - including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft; interest rate fluctuations; inflation or deflation; fuel and other energy costs; raw material or other shortages; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; changes in tax rates and policy; weather; natural disasters; climate change; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by government regulators or others; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; and civil unrest,",

      "answer": "HD's total goodwill balance increased significantly from $7,444 million in fiscal 2023 to $8,455 million in fiscal 2024, primarily driven by acquisitions totaling $998 million. In contrast, SBUX's Channel Development segment maintained a consistent goodwill balance of $34.7 million from fiscal 2022 through 2024, indicating minimal changes in acquisition activity or impairment within that specific segment. This contrast suggests that HD was more actively pursuing acquisitions during this period, while SBUX's investment focus may have been more stable or directed toward other segments.",

This is compounded by GM Financial\u2019s sensitivity to funding availability, which is influenced by capital market access and interest rate benchmarks like SOFR. At the same time, McDonald's notes that higher funding costs and lower credit ratings could impair its ability to hedge commodity price risks effectively, which are already volatile due to factors like beef and chicken market fluctuations. Thus, constrained funding availability would pressure both GM\u2019s automotive financing arm and McDonald\u2019s cost control mechanisms in parallel.",

      "answer": "Starbucks has allocated $2,788.5 million in goodwill specifically to its International Segment as of September 29, 2024, reflecting its strategic emphasis on brand value and market positioning in global markets, particularly in the China reporting unit. This goodwill allocation indicates a focus on long-term intangible investments in international markets. In contrast, Amazon's International Segment assets primarily consist of tangible and operational assets such as property and equipment, operating leases, inventory, and accounts receivable, suggesting a more capital-intensive and logistics-driven approach to international expansion. While Starbucks emphasizes intangible assets tied to market presence, Amazon's asset composition reflects a focus on infrastructure and fulfillment capabilities in international markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "AMZN reported a 10% increase in North America sales in 2024, primarily driven by higher unit sales across its core retail, third-party seller, advertising, and subscription services, despite a $462 million reduction from foreign exchange rate changes. In contrast, NKE experienced a 12% decrease in combined wholesale and direct-to-consumer unit sales, with North America being a key contributor to the decline. This divergence suggests that while overall consumer spending in North America remained strong in sectors like e-commerce and digital services (as reflected by AMZN), demand for athletic footwear/apparel (as represented by NKE) softened, potentially due to inventory adjustments, brand-specific challenges, or shifting consumer preferences within the sector.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSGM is a joint venture we established with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) (50%). SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "Starbucks reported a $2,756.7 million international goodwill balance at the end of FY2022, reflecting its significant investment in international markets through acquisitions and long-term commitments. In contrast, Amazon's International segment assets primarily consist of property and equipment, operating leases, inventory, and accounts receivable, which suggests a more operationally intensive and asset-driven approach to international expansion. The decline in Starbucks' international goodwill from $3,148.3 million in FY2021 to $2,756.7 million in FY2022 indicates a potential reassessment or impairment of prior international investments. This contrast implies that Amazon may focus on building scalable infrastructure and inventory presence globally, while Starbucks has historically relied more on acquisitions and brand licensing in international markets, which carries different financial and strategic risks.",

      "answer": "In 2024, GM recorded $142 million of impairment charges related to Cruise, which contributed to its amortization expense of intangible assets, estimated at $141 million annually for the next five years.

Meanwhile, McDonald's 2024 operating margin decreased from 46% to 45%, impacted by restructuring charges tied to 'Accelerating the Organization' and non-cash impairment charges from the South Korea business sale.

      "answer": "NKE calculates ROIC using NOPAT, which it defines as Net Income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense, for the purpose of evaluating capital efficiency. HD similarly defines NOPAT as Net Operating Profit After Tax and uses it as the numerator in its ROIC calculation, which is presented to show how effectively the company deploys its capital base. Both companies rely on NOPAT as a non-GAAP measure derived from GAAP net income, but NKE emphasizes the role of ROIC in understanding trends excluding foreign exchange impacts, while HD focuses on ROIC as a reflection of capital deployment effectiveness.

However, PEP noted that prior-year charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and asset impairments had a significant impact on its operating profit growth, with a favorable 11-percentage-point effect in 2023 due to the absence of those charges. This implies that one-time charges can materially affect operating profit trends. GM, on the other hand, faces potential future asset impairments or other charges as it undertakes restructuring actions, which could similarly impact its operating results. Therefore, while BKNG projects growth, the comparison across these companies highlights the importance of isolating one-time charges (like those seen at PEP and potentially at GM) to accurately assess underlying operating profit trends.",

      "answer": "Tesla records inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory based on demand forecasts, and a small change in these estimates may result in a material charge to financial results, directly affecting gross margins. This risk is similar to broader supply chain-related gross margin pressures seen at Nike, where supply chain disruptions\u2014including inventory mismanagement and raw material availability\u2014have led to increased costs and margin erosion. Both companies face significant exposure to inventory-related risks, though Tesla\u2019s exposure is tied directly to demand forecasting accuracy, while Nike\u2019s is more influenced by macroeconomic and supply chain volatility.",

          "chunk_text": "## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition:\n\n- Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Declines in consumer spending have in the past and in the future may result in reduced demand for our products, increased inventories, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts and lower gross margins.\n- In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.\n- We conduct transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition.\n- Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. In addition, supply chain issues caused by factors including the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts have impacted and may continue to impact the availability, pricing and timing for obtaining commodities and raw materials.\n- If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.\n- If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.\n\n## Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic have caused, and may in the future cause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets, both globally and in the United States. These events have led to and could again lead to adverse impacts to our global supply chain, factory cancellation costs, store closures, and a decline in retail traffic and discretionary spending by consumers and, in turn, materially impact our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations as well as cause a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across our jurisdictions. We cannot predict whether, and to what degree, our sales, operations and financial results could in the future be affected by the pandemic and preventative measures. Risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and globally, including the effect of prolonged periods of inflation on our consumers and vendors;\n- Disruption to our distribution centers, contract manufacturers, finished goods contract factories and other vendors, through the effects of facility closures, increased operating costs, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, such as additional cleaning and disinfection procedures, which have had, and could in the future again have, a significant impact on our planned inventory production and distribution, including higher inventory levels or inventory shortages in various markets;\n- Impacts to our distribution and logistics providers' ability to operate, including labor and container shortages, and increases in their operating costs. These supply chain effects have had, and could in the future have, an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand, including digital demand, and have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in extended inventory transit times and an increase in our costs of production and distribution, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses;\n- Decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures, reduced operating hours, social distancing restrictions and/or changes in consumer behavior;\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 10",

      "answer": "MCD had a $21 million collateral requirement due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions as of December 31, 2024. GM Financial, in turn, actively manages interest rate and foreign currency risk using derivative instruments, where changes in fair value\u2014especially for non-designated hedges\u2014are recorded directly into interest, operating, and other expenses. This sensitivity to fair value changes is reflected in GM Financial\u2019s $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment, which was driven by deteriorating market conditions in China.

          "chunk_text": "## Net Investment Hedges\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency denominated debt (third-party and intercompany) and foreign currency derivatives to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. A s of December 31, 2024, $13.1 billion of the Company's third-party foreign currency denominated debt, $168 million of the Company's intercompany foreign currency denominated debt and $1.9 billion of foreign currency derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.\n\n## Undesignated Hedges\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. Therefore, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A s an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. The Company may also use certain investments to hedge changes in these liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives or investments are recorded in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in non-operating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2024 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in its financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. A t December 31, 2024, the Company was required to post $21 million of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company has a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') to employees and nonemployee directors.\n\nShare-based compensation, which includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value, is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses.\n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. In addition, the Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized each period.\n\nThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company's stock at date of grant. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a M onte Carlo valuation model.\n\nRefer to the Share-based Compensation footnote on page 63 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION\n\nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2024-3.6; 2023-4.4; 2022-4.8. Share-based compensation awards that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutiv e were (in millions of shares): 2024-1.9; 2023-2.0; 2022-1.5.\n\n## CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nThe Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. A s of December 31, 2024, Cash and equivalents was $1.1 billion of which $451 million consisted of certificates of deposit.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 51",

SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated.

      "answer": "Amazon's AWS sales grew by 37% in 2021 due to increased customer usage, and this growth was partially offset by pricing changes driven by Amazon\u2019s efforts to reduce prices for customers. This pricing strategy could signal broader industry trends toward lower cloud computing costs, which may pressure competitors or related tech-dependent companies like Booking Holdings to adjust their pricing models. Booking Holdings has explicitly stated that price reductions by competitors can trigger stock price volatility, and its financial performance is sensitive to consumer behavior influenced by pricing and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion in 2020 and 2021.\n\nAWS sales increased 37% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.",

          "chunk_text": "## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, ex pected term and ex pected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and ex pected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax  assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax  assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, ex cess tax  benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of ex isting temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company's projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future tax able income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.",

          "chunk_text": "The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.\n\nWe regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded ex pected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair value.\n\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, government rebates receivable was $315 million and $378 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and an immaterial amount and $207 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Financing Receivables\n\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. Interest income on financing receivables is recognized over the loan term as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant's ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\n\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing receivables, we define 'past due' as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an immaterial balance being past due. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022.\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $248 million and $266 million, respectively, of which $4 million and $5 million were due in the nex t 12 months as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for expected credit losses was $33 million and $36 million, respectively.",

      "answer": "Tesla evaluates its allowance for loan losses based on historical credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts affecting future cash flows, with a focus on customer creditworthiness at loan origination. GM Financial, on the other hand, uses static pool modeling for retail receivables and historical loss experience supplemented by forecasted auto industry conditions for commercial receivables. GM's commercial finance receivables, which include $13.3 billion in dealer financing at the end of 2023, are a significant component of its credit risk exposure and are managed under a cash management program that allows dealers to reduce interest by making early payments.",

      "question": "How does the $29.1 billion estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles impact GM's automotive financing risk compared to Tesla's approach to residual value risk in its direct vehicle leasing program with $5.28 billion in gross leased vehicle assets?",
      "answer": "GM Financial's $29.1 billion estimated residual value of leased vehicles directly affects GM's automotive financing risk because GM relies on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers. If actual auction values fall below these estimates, GM Financial may record impairment charges and increased depreciation expenses, which could reduce its ability to support GM's vehicle sales through financing. Tesla, on the other hand, manages residual value risk in its direct leasing program, which includes $5.28 billion in gross leased vehicle assets, by depreciating vehicles to residual value over the lease term using a straight-line method. Tesla's approach exposes it to similar risks if actual used vehicle prices underperform estimates, but without a dedicated financing arm like GM Financial, Tesla absorbs the residual risk directly on its balance sheet, creating a different risk profile despite both companies facing residual value exposure in vehicle leasing.",

We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## MyPower Customer Notes Receivable\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $299 million and $334 million, respectively, of which $11 million and $9 million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for expected credit losses was $41 million and $45 million, respectively.\n\n## Concentration of Risk\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.\n\n## Supply Risk\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Operating Lease Vehicles\n\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $5.28 billion and $3.54 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $773 million and $446 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Digital Assets, Net\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased an aggregate of $1.50 billion in bitcoin (a \"digital asset\") and briefly accepted bitcoin as a payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions, subject to applicable laws. We account for such non-cash consideration at the time we enter into transactions with our customers in accordance with the non-cash consideration guidance included in the Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC') 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , based on the then current quoted market prices of the digital assets.",

As of December 31, 2021, GM Financial held $8.2 billion in foreign currency swaps, resulting in a net liability of $0.2 billion, which minimizes earnings volatility from exchange rate fluctuations. In contrast, Tesla accounts for Panasonic\u2019s production equipment at Gigafactory Nevada as leased assets under a finance lease, with $1.98 billion in capitalized costs as of December 31, 2021. Tesla does not use currency hedging mechanisms for these leased assets but instead amortizes them using the units-of-production method.

The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect GM Financial's financial condition.\n\nGM Financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency. When a different currency is used GM Financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and leased assets to minimize any impact to earnings. As a result, GM Financial believes its market risk exposure relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2021 was insignificant.\n\nGM Financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of $8.2 billion and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The net fair value of these derivative financial instruments was a liability of $0.2 billion and an asset of $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe following table summarizes GM Financial's foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses:\n\n",

Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As the terms of the arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, Leases , we account for their production equipment as leased assets when production commences. We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes, except production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their production equipment within Property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and finance leases. Depreciation on Panasonic production equipment is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had cumulatively capitalized gross costs of $1.98 billion and $1.77 billion, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to the production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we received cash incentives of $6 million, $123 million and $46 million, respectively, from the Shanghai government in connection with us making certain manufacturing equipment investments at Gigafactory Shanghai. These incentives were taken as a reduction to Property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets and cash receipts were reflected as investing cash inflows on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Note 9 - Accrued Liabilities and Other\n\nOur accrued liabilities and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n",

This secured capacity is backed by assets and comes with lower interest rates (e.g., 0.79% initial weighted average rate on securitization notes). In contrast, Starbucks has a $2.8 billion contractual borrowing capacity under its credit facilities, which is unsecured and intended for general corporate purposes such as working capital, acquisitions, and share repurchases.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

GM Financial is required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional collateral for borrowings under certain secured credit facilities. The weighted-average interest rate on secured debt was 1.27% at December 31, 2021. The revolving credit facilities have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2027 and securitization notes payable have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2034.

Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business.\n\nCorporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2022, or 7%, compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2021. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($84 million), increased support costs to address labor market conditions ($36 million) and increased partner wages and benefits ($31 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($62 million).\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## Cash and Investment Overview\n\nOur cash and investments were $3.5 billion and $6.9 billion as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of October 2, 2022, approximately $2.7 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Borrowing capacity\n\n## Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper\n\nOur total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $2.8 billion as of the end of fiscal 2022.\n\n## Revolving Lines of Credit\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the '2021 credit facility'), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The 'Base Rate' of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America's prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1.000%. As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings under the 2021 credit facility.\n\n## Commercial Paper\n\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the",

      "answer": "GM recorded $142 million of impairment charges in 2024 related to the write-off of technology and intellectual property associated with Cruise, following $631 million in charges in June and $522 million in December linked to Cruise's autonomous vehicle delays and strategic shifts. These charges contributed significantly to GM\u2019s overall intangible asset impairment expenses. In comparison, McDonald's reported restructuring and impairment charges in 2024 tied to its 'Accelerating the Organization' strategy, including charges from the sale of its South Korean business and the write-off of impaired software, which negatively impacted its earnings and operating margin.

      "answer": "GM is investing heavily in software-enabled subscriptions like OnStar, Super Cruise, and future offerings such as Ultra Cruise and Ultifi, which represent a strategic growth area beyond traditional vehicle sales. These subscriptions are included in GM\u2019s broader revenue streams, some of which are earned internationally through its GM International (GMI) segment. Similar to how Amazon categorizes subscriptions under its International segment, GM\u2019s international subscription revenue would be exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. This is directly relevant when comparing to Nike, which reported that foreign currency translation had a $132 million favorable impact on its Income before income taxes in fiscal 2022, highlighting the material effect of international exposure on financial performance.",

Business\n\nGeneral  Motors  Company  (sometimes  referred  to  as  we,  our,  us,  ourselves,  the  Company,  General  Motors,  or  GM)  was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries,  primarily  in  China,  with  vehicles  developed,  manufactured  and/or  marketed  under  the Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet  and  Wuling  brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  and commercialization  of  autonomous  vehicle  technology.  We  provide  automotive  financing  services  through  our  General  Motors Financial  Company,  Inc.  (GM  Financial)  segment.  Refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7.  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our  segments.  Except  for  per  share  amounts  or  as  otherwise  specified,  amounts  presented  within  tables  are  stated  in  millions. Forward-looking  statements  in  this  Business  section  are  not  guarantees  of  future  performance  and  may  involve  risks  and uncertainties  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  projected.  Refer  to  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  and  the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business  opportunities,  while  strengthening  our  market  position  in  profitable  internal  combustion  engine  (ICE)  vehicles,  such  as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). We have committed to an all-electric future with a core focus on zero emission battery EVs as  part  of  our  long-term  strategy  to  reduce  petroleum  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions. As  a  result,  we  have committed to making total EV and AV investments of more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025.\n\nWe have an opportunity to grow our vehicle and financing revenue by continuing to capitalize on the strength of our franchises and scaling our EV production and customer base over the next decade. We also have the potential of growing our revenue through our software-enabled services and subscriptions, including OnStar, our advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), Super Cruise, and  future  offerings,  such  as  our  next-generation  ADAS,  Ultra  Cruise,  and  Ultifi.  Additionally,  we  are  incubating  several  new businesses with a start-up mindset that we believe will enable us to attract new customers and generate revenues in new areas.\n\nElectric Vehicles We plan to launch more than 30 EVs globally by 2025. A key element in our EV strategy is Ultium, our all-new dedicated battery electric platform. Our first Ultium-based products launched with the GMC HUMMER EV and BrightDrop EV600 in  2021,  to  be  followed  by  the  Cadillac  LYRIQ  in  2022. This  all-new  platform  is  flexible  and  will  be  leveraged  across  multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, allowing for quick response to customer preferences and a shorter design and development lead time compared to our ICE vehicles.\n\nIn September 2021, we announced three new drive assist motors as part of Ultium Drive, calibrated in-house to ensure the highest level of performance in Ultium-based EVs. We designed the motors as a scalable family, sharing design principles as well as similar tooling and manufacturing strategies.\n\nIn November 2021, we began production at GM's Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center (Factory ZERO), which was re-tooled into a fully dedicated EV facility to produce the GMC HUMMER EV and the upcoming Cruise Origin and Chevrolet Silverado EV, which we revealed in January 2022 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. In January 2022, we announced that we will convert our assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan for production of the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the  electric  GMC  Sierra. Additionally,  we  have  announced  plans  to  mass-produce  battery  cells  for  these  and  other  future  EVs through Ultium Cells LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in Lordstown, Ohio, Spring Hill, Tennessee and Lansing, Michigan. A fourth U.S.-based battery cell plant is also planned by mid-decade.\n\nTo  support  mass  market  adoption  of  EVs,  we  are  working  to  ensure  that  our  customers  will  have  access  to  comprehensive charging solutions. For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging needs at home, the workplace and in public locations.  For  fleet  vehicles,  this  means  turnkey  charging  solutions  and  fleet  and  facility  energy  management  services. We  have announced collaborative work with several charge network operators to filter real-time data on their respective",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $83 million and $110 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $4 million, $(48) million, and $28 million.\n\nWe are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. We resolved the audits of tax years 2007 through 2015 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual.\n\nIn October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission's decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission's decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission's state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter.\n\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.\n\n## Note 10 - SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and content,' 'Marketing,' and 'General and administrative' based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company's business performance and manages its operations.\n\n## North America\n\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.\n\n## International\n\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.\n\n## AWS\n\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.",

      "answer": "AMZN's International segment, which holds $3.2 billion in property and equipment assets, primarily supports retail sales through internationally-focused online stores across Europe, Asia, and other global markets. These operations rely on stable international supply chains to maintain inventory flow and delivery efficiency. However, HD has reported significant challenges in global retail sales due to pandemic-related labor shortages, supply chain delays, and geopolitical tensions\u2014particularly between the U.S. and China\u2014which have increased costs and disrupted product availability. Given that both companies operate in overlapping international markets and HD has already experienced negative impacts, AMZN's International segment could face similar risks that threaten the utilization and performance of its $3.2 billion asset base.",

Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $4 million, $(48) million, and $28 million.\n\nWe are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. We resolved the audits of tax years 2007 through 2015 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual.\n\nIn October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission's decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission's decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission's state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter.\n\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.\n\n## Note 10 - SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and content,' 'Marketing,' and 'General and administrative' based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company's business performance and manages its operations.\n\n## North America\n\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.\n\n## International\n\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.\n\n## AWS\n\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.",

These issues, which may continue or expand depending on the progression of the pandemic, are placing strain on the domestic and international supply chain, which has affected and may continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products. Customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer behaviors have changed, which has challenged our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors have resulted in higher out-of-stock inventory positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products to our distribution and fulfillment centers, stores or customers. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition. Similarly, increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations, as well as those of our third-party carriers, resulting in delays in delivering products to customers. The operation of our distribution and fulfillment centers is crucial to our business operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, labor shortages at and temporary closures of some of our distribution and fulfillment centers, and any such labor shortages or closures, whether temporary or sustained, may adversely impact the flow or availability of products to our stores and customers. Any of these circumstances could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic and related recovery efforts continue to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy and/or to adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section and other SEC filings, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, brand and reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.\n\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies, and the interpretation of certain laws and regulations have become increasingly complex. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data privacy and cybersecurity; the sale, marketing, sourcing, and pricing of some of our products; transportation, logistics and interstate delivery operations, including Department of Transportation regulations on vehicles and drivers; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes, including changes to corporate tax rates; restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; competition and antitrust requirements; ESG performance, transparency and reporting; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or hazardous waste disposal and other environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our sales, operations or profitability.\n\n## If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political, social and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; international trade disputes, trade policy changes or potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; limitations on access to ports; risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; compliance with forced labor laws; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. For example, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. As a portion of our retail products are sourced, directly or indirectly, outside of the U.S., major changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of, demand for, and profitability of retail product sales in our U.S. locations.",

      "answer": "Starbucks reported a net interest income of $122.8 million in fiscal 2024, indicating a relatively stable and modest contribution from interest-related activities. In contrast, GM Financial's net interest income is significantly influenced by interest rate fluctuations due to its asset-sensitive profile as of December 31, 2024\u2014meaning rising rates would increase net interest income, while falling rates would reduce it. This sensitivity is material to GM Financial\u2019s operations, as demonstrated by the company's detailed sensitivity tables. However, GM itself recorded a $0.3 billion impairment charge related to its investment in SAIC-GMAC, signaling a direct negative financial impact from deteriorating market conditions in China. This impairment reflects how interest rate exposure at the segment level (GM Financial) can translate into broader corporate-level financial consequences for GM, unlike Starbucks where interest income plays a minor, less volatile role in overall earnings.",

        "Hop 3: GM Financial \u2190 GM: GM recorded a $0.3 billion impairment on its SAIC-GMAC investment, which is partially tied to GM Financial\u2019s performance and the broader impact of market and interest rate conditions in China."

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period.

      "question": "How do GM's and Tesla's gross carrying amounts for finite-lived intangible assets compare as a percentage of their total intangible assets in their latest 2022 disclosures?",
      "answer": "GM's gross carrying amount for finite-lived intangible assets was $6,026 million, representing approximately 66.7% of its total intangible assets of $9,039 million (based on 2022 data). Tesla's gross carrying amount for finite-lived intangible assets was $450 million, representing approximately 96.7% of its total intangible assets of $465 million. This indicates that Tesla is more heavily reliant on finite-lived intangible assets compared to GM, which holds a larger proportion of indefinite-lived intangible assets.",

      "answer": "Starbucks' goodwill balance allocated to its International Segment increased from $2,691.1 million in fiscal 2023 to $2,788.5 million in fiscal 2024, with the China reporting unit being a significant component of this segment. This increase of $97.4 million suggests that Starbucks continues to prioritize its international markets, especially China, as a core growth engine. The company's annual impairment testing, which found the fair value of the China reporting unit to be greater than its carrying value, supports the conclusion that the International Segment remains strategically vital and financially robust within Starbucks' global operations.",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "HD's goodwill balance grew from $7,444 million in fiscal 2023 to $19,475 million by fiscal 2025, largely driven by acquisitions contributing $11,025 million. In contrast, SBUX's International segment held a goodwill balance of $2,788.5 million in fiscal 2024. However, SBUX's International segment faced a $69 million decline in licensed store revenue driven by lower product and equipment sales and royalty income, compounded by $235 million in unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts.

Our reportable segments are organized as follows:\n\nThe Communications segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:\n\n- Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment.\n- Business Wireline provides advanced IP-based services, as well as traditional voice and data services to business customers.\n- Consumer Wireline provides internet, including broadband fiber, and legacy telephony voice communication services to residential customers.\n\nThe WarnerMedia segment develops, produces and distributes feature films, television, gaming and other content in various physical and digital formats globally. WarnerMedia content is distributed through basic networks, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) or theatrical, TV content and games licensing. Segment results also include Xandr advertising and Otter Media Holdings (Otter Media). We disposed of substantially all Otter Media assets in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc.

      "answer": "SBUX increased its goodwill allocation to the international segment by $97.4 million between fiscal 2023 and 2024, indicating a strategic emphasis on international markets, particularly with the China reporting unit holding $2,788.5 million of goodwill as of September 29, 2024. This suggests a continued investment in global expansion and brand positioning. In contrast, while HD\u2019s 2024 10-K mentions its international segment, no specific details about strategic moves or financial commitments are provided in the disclosed excerpts, making a direct strategic comparison difficult. However, the presence of HD's international segment implies parallel global ambitions, though the lack of detailed disclosures limits deeper competitive analysis.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "LOW's goodwill balance remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $303 million in 2020 to $311 million in 2022, indicating minimal changes in acquisitions or impairments. In contrast, SBUX's goodwill allocated to its International Segment dropped significantly from $3,069.7 million in 2020 to $2,756.7 million in 2022, suggesting possible impairments or strategic reallocations. This divergence may reflect differing approaches to international expansion, with SBUX adjusting its goodwill significantly in response to market dynamics, while LOW maintained a consistent goodwill position.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LOW \u2192 Goodwill Balance: LOW's goodwill balance increased marginally from $303 million in 2020 to $311 million in 2022, showing limited change in acquisition or impairment activity.",
        "Hop 2: Goodwill Balance \u2192 International Segment: SBUX allocated a large portion of its goodwill to the International Segment, which declined from $3,069.7 million in 2020 to $2,756.7 million in 2022, indicating a material shift in its international asset valuation.",
        "Hop 3: International Segment \u2190 SBUX: SBUX operates extensively in international markets through company-operated and licensed stores, suggesting that the goodwill changes likely reflect strategic or market performance adjustments abroad."

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

      "question": "How do rent escalation clauses in MCD's leasing arrangements affect their exposure to real estate tax increases, and how does this compare to HD's treatment of variable real estate tax obligations in their lease liabilities?",
      "answer": "MCD's leases often include rent escalation clauses that can be tied to inflation indices, which may include real estate taxes. These escalations, which occur annually to every five years, expose MCD to increasing rent expenses as real estate taxes rise. This aligns with the broader industry practice where rent escalations are impacted by increased real estate tax assessments, as noted in MS_10k_2023. HD, on the other hand, distinguishes between fixed and variable real estate tax obligations in their leases\u2014fixed payments are included in lease liabilities, while variable payments, which are not based on an index or rate and cannot be reasonably estimated, are recognized only when incurred. This means HD's lease liabilities are less sensitive to real estate tax volatility compared to MCD's rent expense, which is directly influenced by such escalations.",

      "question": "How might Amazon's 22% increase in 2021 unit sales, driven by price reductions, indirectly influence Booking Holdings' stock price volatility, particularly in light of consumer sensitivity to pricing in international markets?",
      "answer": "Amazon's 22% increase in 2021 unit sales was driven by price reductions and shipping offers, which stimulated demand. This suggests that consumers are highly responsive to pricing, especially in international markets where fulfillment costs and foreign exchange fluctuations also played a role. For Booking Holdings, price reductions in the broader travel market\u2014whether initiated by them or influenced by macro trends\u2014can similarly affect consumer behavior, particularly in Europe and other foreign markets where currency fluctuations (e.g., Euro vs. USD) impact affordability. This sensitivity can amplify Booking Holdings' stock price volatility, as changes in average daily rate (ADR) or booking patterns directly affect gross bookings and revenue forecasts, which are key drivers of investor sentiment and stock performance.",

        "Hop 3: Price Reductions \u2190 BKNG: Booking Holdings notes that price sensitivity\u2014especially when currencies weaken\u2014can lead to consumers choosing lower ADR accommodations or canceling international travel, which in turn affects gross bookings and contributes to stock price volatility."

We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.\n\nThe decrease in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs, due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased wage rates and incentives, increased carrier rates, and fulfillment network inefficiencies, and growth in certain operating expenses, including marketing, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $8 million and $88 million for 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe International operating loss in 2021, as compared to the operating income in the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs, due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased wage rates and incentives, and increased carrier rates, and growth in certain operating expenses, including marketing, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales.

In comparison, TSLA reported $177 million in lease receivables for 2025.

          "chunk_text": "## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions and government restrictions resulted in a material decrease in consumer spending and a significant decline in travel and restaurant activities and consumer demand for related services as compared to 2019 levels. Our financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services.\n\nThe extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments. These include, but are not limited to, the severity, extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any new variants of COVID-19 and any resurgences of the pandemic, and the availability and efficacy of vaccines and other medical interventions to prevent or alleviate COVID-19 and their impacts on the travel and restaurant industries and consumer spending more broadly. Even though we have seen some improvements in the economic and operating conditions for our business since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the long-term effects of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industries as a whole.\n\nOur continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our ability to meet debt covenant requirements, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, or financing sources were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels or our industry, our access to capital and the cost of any financing would be negatively impacted. There is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants than those we are currently subject to, which could restrict our business operations. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" Our liquidity, credit ratings, and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $14.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $7.4 billion is held by our international subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and long-term investments held by our international subsidiaries are denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars, Hong Kong Dollars, and Euros. Cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments are principally comprised of money market funds, time deposits and certificates of deposit, convertible debt securities of Trip.com Group, equity securities of Meituan, Grab, and DiDi, and our investments in private companies (see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In December 2021, we redeemed our December 2015 investment of $500 million in Trip.com Group's convertible senior notes (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $912 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), which included $825 million reported as \"Long-term U.S. transition tax liability\" and $87 million included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This liability will be paid over the next five years. In accordance with the Tax Act, generally, future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S. federal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by us.\n\nIn August 2019, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $80 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $100 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. The proceeds of loans made under the facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, share repurchases, and debt repayments. At December 31, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding and $4 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant, compliance with which is a condition to our ability to borrow thereunder. In 2020, we amended the revolving credit facility to (i) suspend the maximum leverage ratio covenant through and including the three months ending March 31, 2022, which was replaced with a $4.5 billion minimum liquidity covenant based on unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and unused capacity under this revolving credit facility and (ii) increase the permitted maximum leverage ratio from and including the three months ending June 30, 2022 through and including the three months ending March 31, 2023. We agreed not to declare or make any cash distribution and not to repurchase any of our shares (with certain exceptions including in connection with tax withholding related to shares issued to employees) unless (i) prior to the delivery of financial statements for the three months ending June 30, 2022, we have at least $6.0 billion of liquidity on a pro forma basis, based on unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and unused capacity under this revolving credit facility and (ii) after the delivery of financial statements for the three months ending June 30, 2022, we are in compliance on a pro forma basis with the maximum leverage ratio covenant then in effect.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "The $391.6 million reduction in SBUX's international goodwill from 2021 to 2022 suggests potential impairment or strategic reevaluation of its international operations, possibly signaling challenges or lower-than-expected returns in those markets. This contrasts with AMZN's continued investment in international assets such as property and equipment, which indicates a growth-oriented strategy in those regions. The juxtaposition implies differing strategic assumptions: SBUX may be de-emphasizing international markets due to performance concerns, while AMZN is doubling down on infrastructure expansion abroad.",

      "answer": "Lowe's international sales grew modestly from $5.0 billion in 2020 to $5.9 billion in 2022, representing a compound growth of $901 million over two years. In contrast, Amazon's international sales growth was significantly higher at 22% in 2021, driven largely by increased unit sales, including third-party seller activity, despite fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. Additionally, Amazon noted that foreign exchange rate fluctuations had a material impact on international sales, with a $3.0 billion effect in 2021. This suggests that while Lowe's maintained a relatively stable international footprint with limited expansion, Amazon aggressively pursued international unit sales growth, investing heavily in fulfillment infrastructure and pricing strategies, even at the cost of short-term profitability in its international segment.",

      "answer": "MCD's lease agreements often include rent escalations tied to inflation indices and fair-value market adjustments, which could amplify its exposure to rising real estate taxes since those taxes directly influence property valuations and, consequently, rent increases. SBUX, on the other hand, reports that real estate taxes are a component of its fixed common-area maintenance (CAM) costs, which are included in lease liabilities and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This suggests that while both companies face cost pressures from real estate taxes, MCD may experience more variability due to its escalation clauses, whereas SBUX has a more structured and predictable cost inclusion method.",

      "answer": "Amazon recognized expected credit losses on its convertible notes issued to Anthropic, which are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' These losses are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on its consolidated statements of operations. According to the accounting principle, the carrying value of a loan takes into account the allowance for loan losses, which reflects expected credit losses over the asset's remaining expected life. GM, applying this principle, disclosed that its allowance for loan losses was 2.6% of finance receivables at December 31, 2024. Therefore, while Amazon accounts for expected credit losses on a fair value basis within comprehensive income, GM applies a static percentage-based allowance against its consumer loan portfolio, reflecting differing risk exposure management strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Other Assets\n\nIncluded in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; convertible notes and certain equity investments; satellite network launch services deposits; and affordable housing loans. We recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements, such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or ex penses.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are ex pensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.1 years. We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $17.4 billion and $19.6 billion. Total video and music expense was $18.9 billion and $20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2024. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Such investments are included in 'Cash and cash equivalents' or 'Marketable securities' on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Ex pected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Non-Marketable Investments\n\nNotes that are convertible to equity classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Credit losses, if any, are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. Upon conversion, the amount of the notes reported at fair value are reclassified generally from available-for-sale to equity investments accounted for at cost, with any associated unrealized gain or loss reclassified from 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' to 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nIn Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a third convertible note, and will invest an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025. The notes are classified as available-for-sale and are classified as Level 3 assets, and as of December 31, 2024 had an estimated fair value of approx imately $13.8 billion. In making these estimates, we utilized valuation methods based on information available, including the rights and obligations of the convertible notes, other outstanding classes of securities, observable transactions such as new securities offerings, estimates of expected time to and type of liquidity events and anticipated securities offerings, and discounts for lack of marketability. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, a portion of the notes were converted to nonvoting preferred stock. As a result of this conversion, a significant portion of the unrealized gain associated with the notes as of December 31, 2024 was reclassified and",

      "question": "How might rising interest costs impact GM's commercial finance receivables through GM Financial, and how does this compare to how HD accounts for interest costs in its capitalization strategy?",
      "answer": "GM Financial, as a subsidiary of GM, manages a large portion of commercial finance receivables, including $13.3 billion in dealer financing at the end of 2023. One of GM Financial\u2019s primary cash outflows is interest costs, which directly affect its ability to fund new receivables and manage existing ones. If interest costs rise, GM Financial\u2019s liquidity could be strained, potentially limiting GM\u2019s ability to extend dealer financing or increasing borrowing costs for dealers. In contrast, HD capitalizes interest costs associated with construction in progress and software development, which suggests a strategy to defer these costs and smooth financial performance over time. This difference in treatment highlights how GM Financial\u2019s exposure to interest costs could have a more immediate impact on its liquidity and financing activities compared to HD, where interest costs are absorbed into asset values and amortized over time.",

We recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements, such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or ex penses.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are ex pensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.1 years. We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $17.4 billion and $19.6 billion. Total video and music expense was $18.9 billion and $20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2024. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Such investments are included in 'Cash and cash equivalents' or 'Marketable securities' on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Ex pected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Non-Marketable Investments\n\nNotes that are convertible to equity classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Credit losses, if any, are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. Upon conversion, the amount of the notes reported at fair value are reclassified generally from available-for-sale to equity investments accounted for at cost, with any associated unrealized gain or loss reclassified from 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' to 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nIn Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a third convertible note, and will invest an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025. The notes are classified as available-for-sale and are classified as Level 3 assets, and as of December 31, 2024 had an estimated fair value of approx imately $13.8 billion. In making these estimates, we utilized valuation methods based on information available, including the rights and obligations of the convertible notes, other outstanding classes of securities, observable transactions such as new securities offerings, estimates of expected time to and type of liquidity events and anticipated securities offerings, and discounts for lack of marketability. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, a portion of the notes were converted to nonvoting preferred stock. As a result of this conversion, a significant portion of the unrealized gain associated with the notes as of December 31, 2024 was reclassified and",

          "chunk_text": "The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.\n\nWe regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded ex pected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair value.\n\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, government rebates receivable was $315 million and $378 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and an immaterial amount and $207 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Financing Receivables\n\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. Interest income on financing receivables is recognized over the loan term as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant's ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\n\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing receivables, we define 'past due' as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an immaterial balance being past due. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022.\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $248 million and $266 million, respectively, of which $4 million and $5 million were due in the nex t 12 months as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for expected credit losses was $33 million and $36 million, respectively.",

      "answer": "Amazon faces significant revenue volatility risks due to its inability to adjust fixed expenses quickly if sales fall short, as disclosed in its 2023 10-K filing. This creates operational leverage risk where a softening in demand could disproportionately impact profitability. In contrast, Booking Holdings demonstrated strong growth in key metrics with a 19.7% increase in rental car days (from 62 to 74 million) and 17.1% growth in room nights (896 to 1,049 million) year-over-year. While Amazon's fixed cost structure creates downside risk in weak demand environments, Booking's growth metrics suggest its business model may provide more operational flexibility during economic downturns, with both companies facing different risk-return profiles in their revenue trajectories.",

For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  consolidated diluted  EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares  outstanding-diluted.  Examples  of  income  tax  adjustments  include  the  establishment  or  reversal  of  significant  deferred  tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our  core  operations  on  a  consistent  basis.  ETR-adjusted  is  calculated  as  Income  tax  expense  less  the  income  tax  related  to  the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before  income  taxes  less  adjustments. When  we  provide  an  expected  adjusted  effective  tax  rate,  we  do  not  provide  an  expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  investment  and  capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review  the  liquidity  of  our  automotive  operations  and  to  measure  and  monitor  our  performance  against  our  capital  allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted  automotive  free  cash  flow  as  automotive  operating  cash  flow  from  operations  less  capital  expenditures  adjusted  for management actions.  Management  actions  can  include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "AMZN intends to indefinitely reinvest substantially all foreign subsidiary earnings outside the U.S., avoiding repatriation costs such as foreign withholding taxes, as noted in its 2022 10-K. In contrast, SBUX acknowledges that if it were to repatriate foreign earnings, it would be subject to material foreign withholding taxes. This aligns with the context provided by UPS's 2022 filing, which states that foreign earnings repatriated to the U.S. are generally subject to foreign withholding and U.S. state taxes. Therefore, while both companies recognize the risk of foreign withholding taxes on repatriation, AMZN avoids triggering those costs by maintaining its foreign cash indefinitely abroad, whereas SBUX retains exposure due to potential future repatriation.",

      "question": "How did changes in NIKE's North America sales growth in fiscal 2022 compare to Amazon's North America sales growth in terms of unit sales performance, and what does this suggest about their respective market demand trends?",
      "answer": "NIKE's North America sales growth in fiscal 2022 was a key contributor to its overall 6% currency-neutral revenue increase, driven by higher average selling prices despite a 3% decline in footwear unit sales. In contrast, Amazon reported an 18% increase in North America sales in 2021, primarily driven by increased unit sales, including third-party seller contributions. This suggests that while NIKE leveraged pricing power to grow revenue despite lower unit volumes, Amazon experienced strong volume-driven demand, indicating differing market dynamics and strategies in consumer engagement and pricing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE \u2192 North America Sales: NIKE's North America sales contributed approximately 3 percentage points to its 6% currency-neutral revenue growth in fiscal 2022, despite a 3% decline in footwear unit sales.",
        "Hop 2: North America Sales \u2192 Unit Sales: Amazon's North America sales growth of 18% in 2021 was primarily driven by increased unit sales, including those from third-party sellers.",
        "Hop 3: Unit Sales \u2190 AMZN: Amazon's increased unit sales were attributed to reduced prices, shipping offers, and increased customer demand, despite fulfillment challenges."

          "chunk_text": "## FISCAL 2022 NIKE BRAND REVENUE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe following tables present NIKE Brand revenues disaggregated by reportable operating segment, distribution channel and major product line:\n\n## FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven by higher revenues in EMEA, North America and APLA, partially offset by lower revenues in Greater China. Higher revenues in EMEA and North America each contributed approximately 3 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, and APLA contributed approximately 2 percentage points, while lower revenues in Greater China reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 4% for fiscal 2022, driven by growth in NIKE Direct, partially offset by a decline in our wholesale business. Unit sales of footwear decreased 3%, while higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct ASP, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven primarily by growth in Men's. Unit sales of apparel remained flat, and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nOn a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 42% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022 compared to 39% for fiscal 2021. NIKE Brand Digital sales were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to $9.1 billion for fiscal 2021. On a currencyneutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2022, driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 18%, comparable store sales growth of 10%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2022 NIKE Brand revenue growth of 6% was primarily driven by increases in Men's and the Jordan Brand, which grew 3% and 7%, respectively.",

For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see 'Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates' below.\n\nNorth America sales increased 18% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. We expect our North America sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021.\n\nInternational sales increased 22% in 2021, compared to the prior year.

      "answer": "HD's goodwill balance increased significantly from $2,254 million at the end of fiscal 2020 to $7,126 million at the end of fiscal 2021, largely due to acquisitions totaling $4,870 million in fiscal 2020 and $323 million in fiscal 2021. In contrast, the Channel Development segment at SBUX maintained a consistent goodwill balance of $34.7 million throughout the same period, indicating minimal acquisition activity or impairment in that segment. This suggests that HD was more actively acquiring businesses during this timeframe, while SBUX focused its acquisition efforts elsewhere, leaving the Channel Development segment relatively untouched.",

      "answer": "MCD reported a 0.5 percentage point impact from GILTI on its effective tax rate in 2024, reflecting the cost of U.S. taxation on global intangible income. In contrast, SBUX's International segment experienced a $235 million revenue reduction due to unfavorable foreign currency translation. While GILTI imposes a tax burden based on U.S. rules for foreign-derived income, SBUX's challenge stems from currency fluctuations affecting reported revenue, showing two distinct financial impacts of global operations: one regulatory (tax-based) and the other economic (currency-based).",

      "answer": "NKE experienced a 6% decrease in combined wholesale and direct-to-consumer unit sales in fiscal 2022, which contrasts with AMZN's 18% North America sales growth driven by increased unit sales, including third-party seller activity. While NKE's unit sales decline was partially offset by a 12% increase in average selling price (ASP), the overall negative impact on sales growth highlights differing market dynamics between the two companies. This divergence suggests that AMZN benefited more significantly from volume-driven demand in North America compared to NKE, which faced supply chain constraints and market-specific challenges.",

We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan.\n\n## FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2022 due to revenue growth in North America, Western Europe and licensee markets, partially offset by declines in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 22%, led by strong digital demand. Wholesale revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China as well as global supply chain constraints. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels decreased 6%, while ASP increased 12%, driven by growth in direct to consumer.\n\nReported EBIT increased 23%, driven by gross margin expansion and higher revenues, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points as higher margins in direct to consumer, growth in licensee revenues, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, were partially offset by higher product costs due to increased freight, duty and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense, while operating overhead increased primarily due to higher professional services costs.",

Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $4 million, $(48) million, and $28 million.\n\nWe are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. We resolved the audits of tax years 2007 through 2015 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual.\n\nIn October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission's decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission's decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission's state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter.\n\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.\n\n## Note 10 - SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and content,' 'Marketing,' and 'General and administrative' based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company's business performance and manages its operations.\n\n## North America\n\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.\n\n## International\n\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.\n\n## AWS\n\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.",

These issues, which may continue or expand depending on the progression of the pandemic, are placing strain on the domestic and international supply chain, which has affected and may continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products. Customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer behaviors have changed, which has challenged our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors have resulted in higher out-of-stock inventory positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products to our distribution and fulfillment centers, stores or customers. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for certain products, they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition. Similarly, increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations, as well as those of our third-party carriers, resulting in delays in delivering products to customers. The operation of our distribution and fulfillment centers is crucial to our business operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, labor shortages at and temporary closures of some of our distribution and fulfillment centers, and any such labor shortages or closures, whether temporary or sustained, may adversely impact the flow or availability of products to our stores and customers. Any of these circumstances could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic and related recovery efforts continue to adversely affect the U.S. and global economy and/or to adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section and other SEC filings, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, brand and reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.\n\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies, and the interpretation of certain laws and regulations have become increasingly complex. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data privacy and cybersecurity; the sale, marketing, sourcing, and pricing of some of our products; transportation, logistics and interstate delivery operations, including Department of Transportation regulations on vehicles and drivers; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes, including changes to corporate tax rates; restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; competition and antitrust requirements; ESG performance, transparency and reporting; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or hazardous waste disposal and other environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our sales, operations or profitability.\n\n## If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our U.S. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. Our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political, social and economic conditions. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; international trade disputes, trade policy changes or potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; limitations on access to ports; risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance; military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other government or private responses; compliance with forced labor laws; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. For example, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. As a portion of our retail products are sourced, directly or indirectly, outside of the U.S., major changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations could adversely impact the cost of, demand for, and profitability of retail product sales in our U.S. locations.",

      "answer": "Starbucks' $2,788.5 million goodwill allocation to its International Segment, particularly the China reporting unit, reflects a strong intangible asset base tied to brand value and market positioning in key international markets. This goodwill-heavy strategy suggests Starbucks is prioritizing long-term market presence and brand equity over physical asset accumulation. In contrast, Amazon's international segment includes significant tangible investments in digital content, inventory, and operating leases, indicating a more asset-intensive and diversified approach. This contrast implies that Starbucks may have greater flexibility to adapt its international strategy with lower capital intensity, while Amazon's approach supports broader service offerings but requires higher ongoing investment. The differing strategies could impact how each company scales in China\u2014Starbucks through brand leverage and Amazon through infrastructure-driven expansion.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

          "chunk_text": "## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.",

Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

Increasing  attention  to  climate  change,  increasing  societal  expectations  on  companies  to  address climate  change  and  changes  in  consumer  preferences  may  result  in  increased  costs,  reduced  demand  for  our  products,  reduced profits, risks associated with new regulatory requirements and the potential for increased litigation and governmental investigations. Climate  change  regulations  at  the  federal,  state  or  local  level  or  in  international  jurisdictions  could  require  us  to  further  limit emissions associated with customer use of products we sell, change our manufacturing processes or product portfolio or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material. These requirements may increase the cost of, and/or  diminish  demand  for,  our  ICE  vehicles.  See  'Our  operations  and  products  are  subject  to  extensive  laws,  regulations  and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.'\n\nPart  of  our  strategy  to  address  these  risks  includes  our  transition  to  EVs,  which  presents  additional  risks,  including  reduced demand for, and therefore profits from, our ICE vehicles, which we plan to use to fund our growth strategy; higher costs related to EV technologies impacting profitability compared to ICE vehicles; and risks related to the success of our EV strategy. See 'Our long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of EVs' and 'Our near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks.'\n\nFinally, increased intensity, frequency or duration of storms, droughts or other severe weather events as a result of climate change may disrupt our production and the production, logistics, cost and procurement of products from our suppliers and timely delivery of vehicles to customers, and could negatively impact working conditions at our plants and those of our suppliers. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Risks related to our operations\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high proportion  of  relatively  fixed  structural  costs,  small  changes  in  sales  volume  can  have  a  disproportionately  large  effect  on  our profitability. A  number  of  economic  and  market  conditions  drive  changes  in  new  vehicle  sales,  including  disruptions  in  the  new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability of affordable financing,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  fuel,  consumer  confidence  and  demand  for  vehicles,  political  unrest  or  uncertainty,  the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, including COVID-19, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A. Any significant decrease in new vehicle sales could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nHigh prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices for commodities, raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, nonferrous  metals,  critical  minerals  or  other  similar  raw  materials,  or  increases  in  logistics  and  related  costs,  may  lead  to  higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, any increase in the cost of critical materials for our EV propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EVs and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. Geopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic and political factors may continue  to  create  pricing  pressure  for  commodities,  raw  materials  and  other  inputs.  These  inflationary  pressures  could,  in  turn, negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\nOur  business  in  China  subjects  us  to  unique  operational,  competitive  and  regulatory  risks. Pursuing  opportunities  in  the Chinese market is an important component of our global growth strategy. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as non-traditional market participants, such as domestic technology companies. In addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EVs, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions or weakening economic conditions in China, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.\n\nCertain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates the scope of our investments and business conducted within China. In order to maintain access to the Chinese market, we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the Chinese market, at times with challenging lead times. These actions may increase the cost of doing business in China or",

      "answer": "Amazon's North America sales grew 18% in 2021, driven primarily by increased unit sales, including those from third-party sellers, despite fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. In contrast, Nike's North America revenues contributed approximately 3 percentage points to its overall revenue growth in fiscal 2022, with footwear unit sales declining by 3% while higher average selling prices (ASP) contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. This comparison highlights Amazon's reliance on volume-driven growth through expanded unit sales, versus Nike's strategy of leveraging pricing power and ASP increases despite lower unit volumes, suggesting divergent business models in how each captures value in the North American market.",

Revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven by higher revenues in EMEA, North America and APLA, partially offset by lower revenues in Greater China. Higher revenues in EMEA and North America each contributed approximately 3 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, and APLA contributed approximately 2 percentage points, while lower revenues in Greater China reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 4% for fiscal 2022, driven by growth in NIKE Direct, partially offset by a decline in our wholesale business. Unit sales of footwear decreased 3%, while higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct ASP, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven primarily by growth in Men's. Unit sales of apparel remained flat, and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nOn a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 42% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022 compared to 39% for fiscal 2021. NIKE Brand Digital sales were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to $9.1 billion for fiscal 2021. On a currencyneutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2022, driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 18%, comparable store sales growth of 10%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2022 NIKE Brand revenue growth of 6% was primarily driven by increases in Men's and the Jordan Brand, which grew 3% and 7%, respectively.",

      "answer": "Tesla's 56% increase in automotive leasing revenue in 2021 indicates a growing segment of their business tied to lease accounting, including vehicles under direct operating leases and resale value guarantees. This growth could intensify competitive pressure on GM Financial, which plays a central role in supporting GM\u2019s vehicle sales through leasing and financing services. Given that GM Financial cites vehicle return rates and residual value performance as key risks affecting its leasing portfolio, Tesla\u2019s expansion into leasing may amplify residual value volatility in the broader market, particularly if Tesla\u2019s lease vehicles enter the used car market in large numbers. This could indirectly impact GM Financial\u2019s ability to manage residual risk and maintain competitive leasing terms, thereby affecting GM\u2019s overall market penetration strategy.",

Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nServices and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.",

Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Warranties\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\n\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.",

          "chunk_text": "We  often  partner  with  third-party  providers  for  certain  worker  services  and  we  may  provide  certain  limited  worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## Economic and Industry Risks\n\n## Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nThe uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition:\n\n- Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Declines in consumer spending have in the past and in the future may result in reduced demand for our products, increased inventories, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts and lower gross margins.\n- In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.\n- We conduct transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition.\n- Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. In addition, supply chain issues caused by factors including the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts have impacted and may continue to impact the availability, pricing and timing for obtaining commodities and raw materials.\n- If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.\n- If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.\n\n## Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic have caused, and may in the future cause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets, both globally and in the United States. These events have led to and could again lead to adverse impacts to our global supply chain, factory cancellation costs, store closures, and a decline in retail traffic and discretionary spending by consumers and, in turn, materially impact our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations as well as cause a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across our jurisdictions. We cannot predict whether, and to what degree, our sales, operations and financial results could in the future be affected by the pandemic and preventative measures. Risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and globally, including the effect of prolonged periods of inflation on our consumers and vendors;\n- Disruption to our distribution centers, contract manufacturers, finished goods contract factories and other vendors, through the effects of facility closures, increased operating costs, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, such as additional cleaning and disinfection procedures, which have had, and could in the future again have, a significant impact on our planned inventory production and distribution, including higher inventory levels or inventory shortages in various markets;\n- Impacts to our distribution and logistics providers' ability to operate, including labor and container shortages, and increases in their operating costs. These supply chain effects have had, and could in the future have, an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand, including digital demand, and have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in extended inventory transit times and an increase in our costs of production and distribution, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses;\n- Decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures, reduced operating hours, social distancing restrictions and/or changes in consumer behavior;\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 10",

      "question": "How does the average term of lease receivables disclosed by Tesla compare to the typical lease duration described in the financing receivables footnote that collateralizes leased equipment, and what might this imply about asset management strategies between Tesla and traditional automotive companies like GM?",
      "answer": "Tesla's sales-type leases have a total gross receivable of $484 million, with lease payments extending through 2029. This suggests longer-duration leases, particularly with $177 million in 2025 and $185 million in 2026. In contrast, the financing receivables footnote (from a third-party perspective) states that lease receivables typically have terms of four years on average. Tesla\u2019s lease structure appears to extend beyond this typical duration, indicating potentially different asset turnover strategies. Meanwhile, GM reports $31,586 million in equipment on operating leases, suggesting a larger base of leased assets that may be tied to shorter-term customer leasing programs. This contrast implies Tesla may be taking a longer-term asset financing approach compared to more traditional leasing models seen at GM, which focuses on operational fleet leasing rather than sales-type financing.",

Loan  receivables  represent  financing  arrangements  related  to  the  sale  of  our hardware, software, and services (including technical support and advanced services), and also may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Loan receivables have terms of one year to three years on average. Lease receivables represent sales-type leases resulting from the sale of Cisco's and complementary third-party products and are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average.\n\nA summary of our financing receivables is presented as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "HD monitors commodity price fluctuations and may adjust selling prices to recover higher costs, though its ability to do so is limited by competitive pressures, and it does not use derivative instruments to manage these risks. In contrast, LOW acknowledges that its selling prices are influenced by market prices and incorporates market price assumptions into its Monte-Carlo simulations for performance share units, which are tied to TSR and ROIC targets. While HD relies solely on price adjustments without derivatives, LOW integrates market price volatility into its equity compensation modeling, showing differing approaches to managing commodity and market price exposure.",

        "Hop 1: HD \u2192 Selling Prices: HD may adjust selling prices in response to commodity price volatility but does not use derivatives and is constrained by competition.",

      "question": "How would a reduction in funding availability due to tighter credit markets impact both McDonald's financial flexibility and GM's automotive financing operations through their shared exposure to GM Financial's $13.3 billion dealer financing portfolio?",
      "answer": "A reduction in funding availability due to tighter credit markets would first negatively affect McDonald's financial flexibility, as stated in its 2023 10-K, by increasing interest expenses, limiting access to favorable financing terms, and imposing new financial covenants. This same tightening would also impact GM Financial, which relies on access to capital markets to fund its automotive financing services. Specifically, GM Financial had $13.3 billion in dealer financing at the end of 2023, and constrained funding availability could impair its ability to extend credit to dealers, directly affecting GM\u2019s ability to support vehicle sales and market penetration. Thus, both companies would face operational and financial constraints through their exposure to credit market conditions, albeit through different mechanisms\u2014MCD via corporate financing and GM through its captive finance arm.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MCD \u2192 Funding Availability: McDonald's explicitly states that reduced funding availability negatively affects its profitability, interest expense, and financial flexibility.",
        "Hop 2: Funding Availability \u2192 GM Financial: GM Financial's operations depend on access to capital markets, and tighter funding conditions would impair its ability to provide dealer financing, which is a core part of its business.",
        "Hop 3: GM Financial \u2190 GM: GM relies on GM Financial to provide $13.3 billion in dealer financing, which directly supports vehicle sales and dealer relationships; any disruption in funding would reduce GM's market penetration and sales support."

      "answer": "Starbucks reported a goodwill balance of $2,756.7 million in its International Segment as of October 2, 2022, reflecting substantial historical investments in global expansion through company-operated stores and acquisitions. This goodwill represents a large portion of its total goodwill of $3,283.5 million and indicates a capital-intensive, brand-driven international growth strategy. In contrast, Amazon's International Segment asset composition focuses on property and equipment, operating leases, inventory, and accounts receivable, suggesting a more diversified and logistics-centric approach to global operations. While Starbucks' international goodwill signals deep equity investments in foreign markets, Amazon's international assets support a broader infrastructure and e-commerce model, highlighting distinct strategic priorities in global expansion.",

        "Hop 1: SBUX \u2192 Goodwill Balance: Starbucks disclosed a goodwill balance of $2,756.7 million in its International Segment as of 2022, indicating significant investment in global markets.",
        "Hop 2: Goodwill Balance \u2192 International Segment: This goodwill is a major component of Starbucks' international operations, showing the company's reliance on acquisitions and long-term store development abroad.",
        "Hop 3: International Segment \u2190 AMZN: Amazon's International Segment includes assets like property and equipment, operating leases, and inventory, reflecting a more diversified and infrastructure-heavy global strategy."

      "answer": "AMZN's allowance for expected credit losses of $1.3 billion is tied to its investments in marketable debt securities, where declines in fair value below carrying value are evaluated for expected credit losses and recorded as an allowance. This reflects AMZN's exposure to credit risk through its investment portfolio. GM's allowance for loan losses of $2.3 billion pertains to its retail finance receivables portfolio, which includes consumer loans for vehicle purchases. GM's allowance reflects expected credit losses over the remaining life of these loans, which have a weighted-average remaining life of approximately two years. The difference in the size and nature of these allowances highlights AMZN's focus on investment-grade securities with short-to-intermediate maturities, versus GM's exposure to consumer credit risk through its automotive financing operations. The JPM evidence clarifies that expected credit losses directly determine the allowance for loan losses, which aligns with both companies' approaches in valuing their respective portfolios.",

      "answer": "HD's goodwill balance increased by $1,011 million (from $7,444 million to $8,455 million) from fiscal 2022 to 2023, primarily due to acquisitions. In contrast, Starbucks' Corporate and Other segment maintained a constant goodwill balance of $1.0 million throughout the period, indicating no significant acquisition or impairment activity in that segment. This suggests that HD was more actively acquiring businesses affecting goodwill, while Starbucks' Corporate and Other segment remained stable.",

      "answer": "SBUX's International segment reported a decrease in licensed stores revenue of $69 million, which contributed to a goodwill balance of $2,788.5 million by the end of fiscal 2024. In contrast, HD experienced a significant increase in goodwill primarily due to acquisitions, including a $11,025 million goodwill addition from 'Other' segments, leading to a total goodwill balance of $19,475 million by the end of fiscal 2025. This shows that while SBUX's goodwill in the International segment grew modestly, HD's goodwill surged due to acquisition-driven additions.",

        "Hop 1: SBUX \u2192 International Segment: SBUX's International segment experienced a $69 million decline in licensed stores revenue, indicating a negative impact on that business unit.",

Partially offsetting this increase were a 2% decrease in comparable store sales ($629 million), attributable to a 4% decrease in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket, primarily due to annualization of pricing, and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts ($235 million).\n\nLicensed stores revenue decreased $8 million, primarily driven by lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees in our International segment ($69 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts ($27 million), partially offset by higher product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees in our North America segment ($80 million).\n\nOther revenues decreased $95 million, primarily due to a decline in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($125 million) following the sale of our Seattle's Best Coffee brand to Nestl\u00e9 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as well as product SKU optimization.",
