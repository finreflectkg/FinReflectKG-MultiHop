      "answer": "BK emphasizes regulatory disclosures and transparency around liquidity metrics, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, as part of its broader commitment to regulatory compliance and investor communication. MA indirectly reflects pressure on liquidity through its acknowledgment of pandemic-driven financial stress and intense global competition, which could constrain cash flow and liquidity buffers. PYPL explicitly outlines the geographic distribution of its cash holdings\u2014$7.4 billion internationally as of 2021\u2014and explains how these balances must satisfy both customer access needs and regulatory liquidity ratios across jurisdictions. Together, these perspectives reveal that BK prioritizes formal liquidity disclosures, MA faces external pressures that could erode liquidity, and PYPL actively balances liquidity between operational needs and regulatory obligations.",

There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities or voluntary actions taken by the public.\n\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  has  adversely  impacted  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  There  are  no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of this pandemic or a similar health epidemic in the future is highly uncertain and subject to change. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken in response, further impacts our business, results of operations and financial  condition  will  depend  on  future  developments,  which  are  uncertain,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  duration  of  the pandemic and its impact on the global economy, including how quickly and to what extent we can continue to progress toward more consistent economic and operating conditions. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially  adverse  impacts  to  our  business  and  our  result  of  operations  as  a  result  of  its  global  economic  impact,  including  any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\n\n## Competition and Technology\n\nSubstantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\nThe global payments industry is highly competitive. Our payment programs compete against competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry and compete in all categories of payment, including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments. We compete against general purpose payments networks, debit and local networks, ACH and real-time account-based payments  systems,  alternative  payments  systems  and  new  entrants  (focused  on  online  activity  across  various  channels  and processing  payments  using  in-house  capabilities),  national  networks  and  digital  currencies.  We  also  face  competition  from companies  that  provide  alternatives  to  our  value-added  services  and  adjacent  network  capabilities  (including  open  banking  and digital identity).\n\nOur traditional competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs,  services,  and  payment  capabilities  than  we  offer  or  may  use  more  effective  advertising  and  marketing  strategies  to achieve broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we have. They may also introduce their own innovative programs, value-added services and capabilities that adversely impact our growth.\n\nCertain of our competitors to our core network operate three-party payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and these competitors may derive competitive advantages from their business models. If we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a four-party system, or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not, we could lose business to these competitors. See 'Business - Competition' in Part I, Item 1.\n\nNew  entrants  against  whom  we  compete  have  developed  alternative  payments  systems,  e-commerce  payments  systems  and payments  systems  for  mobile  devices,  as  well  as  physical  store  locations.  A  number  of  these  new  entrants  rely  principally  on technology to support their services that provides cost advantages, and as a result may enjoy lower costs than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nOur ability to compete may also be affected by regulatory and legislative initiatives, as well as the outcomes of litigation, competitionrelated regulatory proceedings and central bank activity and legislative activity.\n\nIf we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business.\n\nAs the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face disintermediation and related risks, including:\n\n- Parties  that  process  our  transactions  in  certain  countries  may  try  to  eliminate  our  position  as  an  intermediary  in  the  payment process. For example, merchants could switch (and in some cases are switching) transactions directly with issuers. Additionally, processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Large scale consolidation within processors could result  in  these  processors  developing  bilateral  agreements  or  in  some  cases  switching  the  entire  transaction  on  their  own network, thereby disintermediating us.\n- Industry participants continue to invest in and develop alternative capabilities, such as account to account payments, which could facilitate P2M transactions that compete with our core payments network.",

The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner's own loyalty program.                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit cards - Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Discount revenue - Represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Goods & Services (G&S) spend - Includes spend in merchant categories other than T&E-related merchant categories, which includes B2B spending by small and mid-sized enterprise customers in our CS and ICS segments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Interest expense - Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. |\n| Interest income - Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Interest on loans - Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Interest and dividends on investment securities - Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.                                                                                                    |\n| Interest income on deposits with banks and other - Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Loyalty coalitions - Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Net card fees - Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Net interest yield on average Card Member loans - A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Net write-off rate - principal only - Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Net write-off rate - principal, interest and fees - Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Network volumes - Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Operating expenses - Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing and equipment, and other expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, PayPal, and Charles Schwab each quantify their exposure to charge-offs in 2023, and what does this reveal about their relative credit risk management in consumer lending and financing activities?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reported $53 million in charge-offs in 2023, reflecting relatively stable credit performance in its nonperforming loans. PayPal experienced significantly higher charge-offs of $271 million for merchant loans and advances in 2023, indicating greater credit risk in its lending portfolio. Charles Schwab reported zero charge-offs across its residential real estate and pledged asset lines in 2023, suggesting a more conservative or well-performing credit portfolio. This comparison highlights differing credit risk profiles, with PayPal facing the highest loan loss realization, while Schwab maintained a clean charge-off record, and Bank of America showed moderate and stable credit losses.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 Charge-offs: BAC reported $53 million in charge-offs during 2023, contributing to a slight decline in total nonperforming loans from $2,754 million to $2,712 million.",
        "Hop 2: PYPL \u2192 Charge-offs: PYPL recorded $271 million in charge-offs for merchant loans and advances in 2023, significantly exceeding its provisions and indicating higher-than-expected credit losses.",
        "Hop 3: SCHW \u2192 Charge-offs: SCHW reported no charge-offs in its residential real estate or pledged asset lines in 2023, suggesting strong credit quality or limited credit risk realization."

      "answer": "Bank of America highlights that a significant increase in default rates would result in a significantly lower fair value for long positions in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, indicating high sensitivity to credit deterioration. Morgan Stanley explains that default rates are a key input in discounted cash flow models used to value these securities, with valuation often requiring benchmarking to comparable instruments and incorporating forecasted credit losses and recovery rates. Charles Schwab notes that increases in default rates can lead to higher credit loss expense and write-downs on mortgage loans, particularly when combined with housing price declines and economic downturns.

When evaluating the comparable instruments for use in the valuation of each security, security collateral-specific attributes, including payment priority, credit enhancement levels, type of collateral, delinquency rates and loss severity, are  considered.  In  addition,  for  RMBS  borrowers,  FICO  scores  and  the level of documentation for the loan are considered.\n- Market standard cash flow models may be utilized to model the specific collateral  composition  and  cash  flow  structure  of  each  transaction.  Key inputs to these models are market spreads, forecasted credit losses, and default and prepayment rates for each asset category.\n- Valuation levels of RMBS and CMBS indices are used as an additional data point for benchmarking purposes or to price outright index positions.\n\nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\n- Level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments\n- Level 3-if external prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or not  supported  by  market  liquidity  or  if  the  comparability  assessment involves significant subjectivity related to property type differences, cash flows, performance or other inputs\n\n## Loans and Lending Commitments\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- Fair  value  of  corporate  loans  is  determined  using  recently  executed transactions,  market  price  quotations  (where  observable),  implied  yields from comparable debt, market observable CDS spread levels obtained from independent  external  parties  adjusted  for  any  basis  difference  between cash and derivative instruments, along with proprietary valuation models and default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.\n- Fair value of contingent corporate lending commitments is determined by using  executed  transactions  on  comparable  loans  and  the  anticipated market  price  based  on  pricing  indications  from  syndicate  banks  and customers. The valuation of loans and lending commitments also takes into account fee income that is considered an attribute of the contract.\n- Fair value of mortgage loans is determined using observable prices based on  transactional  data  or  third-party  pricing  for  comparable  instruments, when available.\n- Where  position-specific  external  prices  are  not  observable,  fair  value  is estimated  based  on  benchmarking  to  prices  and  rates  observed  in  the primary market for similar loan\n- or borrower types or based on the present value of expected future cash flows  using  the  Firm's  best  available  estimates  of  the  key  assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved or a methodology that utilizes the capital structure and credit spreads of recent comparable securitization transactions.\n- Fair  value  of  equity  margin  loans  is  determined  by  discounting  future interest cash flows, net of potential losses resulting from large downward price  movements  of  the  underlying  margin  loan  collateral.  The  potential losses  are  modeled  using  the  margin  loan  rate,  which  is  calibrated  from market observable CDS spreads, implied debt yields or volatility metrics of the loan collateral.\n\nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\n- Level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments\n- Level  3-in  instances  where  prices  or  significant  spread  inputs  are unobservable or not supported by market liquidity or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity\n\n## Corporate and Other Debt\n\nCorporate Bonds\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- Fair value is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations,  bond  spreads  and  CDS  spreads  obtained  from  independent external  parties,  such  as  vendors  and  brokers,  adjusted  for  any  basis difference between cash and derivative instruments.\n- The spread data used is for the same maturity as the bond. If the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that references comparable issuers are  used. When  position-specific  external  price  data  is  not observable,  fair  value  is  determined  based  on  either  benchmarking  to comparable instruments or cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single-name  CDS  spreads  and  recovery  rates  or  loss  given  default  as significant inputs.\n\nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\n- Level  2-if  value  based  on  observable  market  data  for  comparable instruments\n- Level  3-in  instances  where  prices  or  significant  spread  inputs  are unobservable  or  if  the  comparability  assessment  involves  significant subjectivity\n\n## CDOs\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- The  Firm  holds  cash  CDOs  that  typically  reference  a  tranche  of  an underlying synthetic portfolio of single-name  CDS spreads collateralized by  corporate  bonds  ('CLN')  or  cash  portfolio  of  ABS/loans  ('assetbacked CDOs').\n- Credit correlation, a primary input used to determine the fair value of CLNs, is  usually  unobservable  and  derived  using  a  benchmarking  technique.

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss. The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of multiple factors. If management determines that a security's decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss, an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings. Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time.\n\nOur bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, PALs, and HELOCs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors, can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense, as well as write downs on such loans.\n\nHeightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:\n\n- Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;\n- Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and\n- Client margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index , or industry.\n\nThe Company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although the Company has no obligation to do so, the Company may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause the Company to take significant charges, could reduce the Company's liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in the Company having to consolidate one or more funds in its financial statements. If the Company were to choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, the Company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.\n\n## Compliance Risks\n\nExtensive regulatory supervision of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities.\n\nAs a participant in the securities, banking, and financial services industries, we are subject to ex tensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct. We become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as we grow.\n\nRegulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy. Regulators could also limit our ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions, and undertaking strategic investments. Our banking regulators could require CSC and/or our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital, increase liquidity, or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC's ability to repurchase or redeem shares. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or ex pulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.",

MA notes that the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy has disrupted its liquidity position and exposed vulnerabilities in its financial condition. MET emphasizes the susceptibility of its financial assets to severe market events, where depreciation and reduced liquidity impact its ability to realize fair value on securities, suggesting a focus on asset-level liquidity risks. Together, these perspectives reveal that AXP is sensitive to systemic capital market shifts, MA faces liquidity pressures from macroeconomic shocks, and MET is exposed to liquidity constraints in asset realization during market stress.",

There  are  no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of this pandemic or a similar health epidemic in the future is highly uncertain and subject to change.

Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially  adverse  impacts  to  our  business  and  our  result  of  operations  as  a  result  of  its  global  economic  impact,  including  any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\n\n## Competition and Technology\n\nSubstantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\nThe global payments industry is highly competitive.

We compete against general purpose payments networks, debit and local networks, ACH and real-time account-based payments  systems,  alternative  payments  systems  and  new  entrants  (focused  on  online  activity  across  various  channels  and processing  payments  using  in-house  capabilities),  national  networks  and  digital  currencies.  We  also  face  competition  from companies  that  provide  alternatives  to  our  value-added  services  and  adjacent  network  capabilities  (including  open  banking  and digital identity).\n\nOur traditional competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs,  services,  and  payment  capabilities  than  we  offer  or  may  use  more  effective  advertising  and  marketing  strategies  to achieve broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we have. They may also introduce their own innovative programs, value-added services and capabilities that adversely impact our growth.\n\nCertain of our competitors to our core network operate three-party payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and these competitors may derive competitive advantages from their business models. If we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a four-party system, or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not, we could lose business to these competitors. See 'Business - Competition' in Part I, Item 1.\n\nNew  entrants  against  whom  we  compete  have  developed  alternative  payments  systems,  e-commerce  payments  systems  and payments  systems  for  mobile  devices,  as  well  as  physical  store  locations.  A  number  of  these  new  entrants  rely  principally  on technology to support their services that provides cost advantages, and as a result may enjoy lower costs than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nOur ability to compete may also be affected by regulatory and legislative initiatives, as well as the outcomes of litigation, competitionrelated regulatory proceedings and central bank activity and legislative activity.\n\nIf we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business.\n\nAs the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face disintermediation and related risks, including:\n\n- Parties  that  process  our  transactions  in  certain  countries  may  try  to  eliminate  our  position  as  an  intermediary  in  the  payment process. For example, merchants could switch (and in some cases are switching) transactions directly with issuers. Additionally, processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Large scale consolidation within processors could result  in  these  processors  developing  bilateral  agreements  or  in  some  cases  switching  the  entire  transaction  on  their  own network, thereby disintermediating us.\n- Industry participants continue to invest in and develop alternative capabilities, such as account to account payments, which could facilitate P2M transactions that compete with our core payments network.",

Fair Value\n\nWhen developing estimated fair values,  the  Company  considers  three  broad  valuation  approaches:  (i)  the  market  approach, (ii)  the  income  approach,  and  (iii)  the  cost  approach. The  Company  determines  the  most  appropriate  valuation  approach  to  use, given  what  is  being  measured  and  the  availability  of  sufficient  inputs,  giving  priority  to  observable  inputs.  The  Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the significant input with the lowest level in its valuation. The input levels are as follows:\n\n- Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company defines active markets based on average trading volume for equity securities. The size of the bid/ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for fixed maturity securities AFS.\n- Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs can include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other than quoted prices in Level 1, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other significant inputs that are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n- Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the determination of estimated fair value of the assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. The Company's ability to sell securities, as well as the price ultimately realized for these securities, depends upon the  demand  and  liquidity  in  the  market  and  increases  the  use  of  judgment  in  determining  the  estimated  fair  value  of  certain securities.\n\nConsiderable judgment is often required in interpreting the market data used to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.",

      "answer": "Citigroup mentions that government-guaranteed fair value loans do not require LTV information for credit risk assessment, indicating a policy of excluding certain fair value loans from traditional risk metrics. JPMorgan reports $4,530 million in loans measured at fair value of collateral less cost to sell, with $325 million in net charge-offs for collateral-dependent loans, showing a quantified and segmented approach to fair value loan risk. Morgan Stanley notes that the difference between principal and fair value for loans often stems from distressed debt purchased below par, highlighting a focus on acquisition strategy and impairment. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three banks manage fair value loans, they differ in how they assess, disclose, and account for the credit risk associated with these assets.",

      "answer": "AXP notes that increases in delinquencies, along with higher loan balances, have driven up its Card Member loans reserve for credit losses. COF highlights that increases in delinquencies and credit losses could result in inadequate reserves, negatively affecting financial results. JPM states that extraordinary events could lead to an increase in delinquencies, which would raise the allowance for credit losses and reduce earnings. Together, these perspectives show that all three firms are acutely sensitive to delinquency trends, though they differ in how they frame the implications\u2014AXP focuses on reserve changes, COF on estimation risk, and JPM on event-driven delinquency spikes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AXP \u2192 Delinquencies: AXP explicitly links delinquency increases to higher credit loss reserves, noting that both 2024 and 2023 saw reserve growth due to delinquencies and rising loan balances.",
        "Hop 2: COF \u2192 Delinquencies: COF identifies delinquencies as a risk factor that could lead to inadequate reserves and negatively impact financial results, indicating a concern over estimation accuracy and capital adequacy.",
        "Hop 3: JPM \u2192 Delinquencies: JPM states that extraordinary events could lead to higher delinquencies, which in turn would increase credit loss allowances and reduce earnings, emphasizing systemic risk and event sensitivity in credit quality."

These assumptions, judgments and estimates are inherently limited because they involve techniques, which could include the use of historical data and AI, that cannot anticipate or model every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which Citi operates, nor can they anticipate the specific impact and timing of such outcomes. For example, many models used by Citi include assumptions about correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators that may not hold in times of market stress, limited liquidity or other unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIf Citi's assumptions, judgments or estimates underlying its financial statements are incorrect or differ from actual or subsequent events, Citi could ex perience unex pected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could be significant. Citi could also experience declines in its stock price, be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings and incur fines and other losses. For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing Citi's financial statements, see 'Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates' below and Notes 1 and 16.\n\nFor example, the CECL methodology requires that Citi provide reserves for a current estimate of lifetime ex pected credit losses for its loan portfolios and other financial assets, as applicable, at the time those assets are originated or acquired. This estimate is adjusted each period for changes in ex pected lifetime credit losses. Citi's ACL estimate is subject to judgments and depends upon its CECL models and assumptions; forecasted macroeconomic conditions, including, among other things, the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (real GDP); and the credit indicators, composition and other characteristics of Citi's loan portfolios and other applicable financial assets. These model assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic conditions will change over time, resulting in variability in Citi's ACL and, thus, impact its results of operations and financial condition, as well as regulatory capital due to the CECL phase-in (see the capital return risk factor above). For additional information on Citi's ACL, see 'Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates' below and Notes 1 and 16.\n\nMoreover, Citi has incurred losses related to its foreign operations that are reported in the CTA components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) . In accordance with U.S. GAAP, a sale, substantial liquidation or other deconsolidation event of any foreign operations, such as those related to Citi's remaining divestitures or legacy businesses, would result in reclassification of any foreign CTA component of AOCI related to that foreign operation, including related hedges and taxes, into Citi's earnings. For ex ample, Citi could incur a significant loss on sale due to CTA losses related to any such divestitures (see the capital risk factor above and the emerging markets risk factor below). The majority of these losses would be regulatory capital neutral at the completion of the divestiture. For additional information on Citi's accounting policy for foreign currency translation and its foreign CTA components of AOCI , see Notes 1 and 21.\n\n## Changes to Financial Accounting and Reporting Standards or Interpretations Could Have a Material Impact on How Citi Records and Reports Its Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nPeriodically, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issues financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of Citi's financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards become effective, including those areas where Citi is required to make assumptions or estimates. Changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations, whether promulgated or required by the FASB, the SEC, U.S. banking regulators or others, could present operational challenges and could also require Citi to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements, which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally and/or with respect to particular businesses. See Note 1 for additional information on Citi's accounting policies and changes in accounting, including the expected impacts on Citi's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## If Citi's Risk Management and Other Processes, Strategies or Models Are Deficient or Ineffective, Citi May Incur Significant Losses and Its Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios Could Be Negatively Impacted.\n\nCiti utilizes a broad and diversified set of risk management and other processes and strategies, including the use of models in analyzing and monitoring the various risks Citi assumes in conducting its activities. For ex ample, Citi uses models across the Company as part of its comprehensive stress testing initiatives. Citi also relies on data to aggregate, assess and manage various risk ex posures. Management of these risks and the reliability of the data are made more challenging within a large, global financial institution, such as Citi, particularly due to complex , diverse and rapidly changing financial markets and conditions in which Citi operates. Unexpected losses can result from untimely, inaccurate or incomplete processes and data. In 2020 Citigroup and Citibank entered into Consent Orders with the FRB and OCC that require Citigroup and Citibank to make improvements in various aspects of enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data quality management related to governance, and internal controls (see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below).\n\nIn addition, Citi's risk management and other processes, strategies and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques, including the use of historical data in many circumstances, assumptions and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which Citi operates, particularly given various macroeconomic, geopolitical and other challenges and uncertainties (see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk factor above), nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. For example, many models used by Citi include assumptions about correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators that may not necessarily hold in times of market stress, limited liquidity or other unforeseen",

      "answer": "AIG reports $440 million in Industrial loans in New York and $1,751 million in Industrial loans internationally, indicating a significant global exposure. COF discloses $56,042 million in commercial and industrial loans, with $181 million delinquent (>90 days), suggesting a moderate but growing risk in this segment. JPM reports $4,332 million in commercial and industrial loans, showing a smaller but still meaningful exposure compared to its larger residential and real estate portfolios. Together, these figures reveal that while all three institutions maintain positions in commercial and industrial loans, COF has the largest exposure with notable delinquency, AIG has a globally diversified but smaller footprint, and JPM maintains a relatively smaller allocation within a broader wholesale loan portfolio.",

      "answer": "AXP discusses transaction volume in the context of calculating changes in financial metrics, specifically referencing the impact of volume changes multiplied by prior-year rates on performance. MS highlights that its global operations and high volume of transactions processed expose it to significant cybersecurity and operational risks, with potential adverse effects on its business and financial condition. PYPL notes that regulatory and legal challenges in the payments industry could lead to decreased transaction volume and revenue, framing it as a risk factor tied to compliance costs and business practice changes. Together, these perspectives show that while all three firms are sensitive to transaction volume, AXP focuses on its analytical impact, MS emphasizes operational and security risks, and PYPL highlights regulatory and legal threats to transaction flow.",

BAC explicitly defines its dividend payout ratio as common dividends declared divided by net income applicable to common shareholders, indicating a transparent and income-linked approach. COF calculates its common dividend payout ratio using dividends per common share divided by basic earnings per common share, suggesting a per-share earnings linkage for dividend planning. Together, these perspectives reveal that while BAC and COF emphasize income-based metrics for dividend policy, AIG's ability to maintain payouts is more contingent on external market and regulatory factors.",

MET disclosed $35 million in 'Loans to subsidiaries' in 2021, showing a small but explicit exposure to internal lending.

      "answer": "Bank of America reported total fees and commissions of $32,009 million in 2023, with significant contributions from card income, service charges, and investment banking fees, indicating a diversified fee-based income model. BlackRock disclosed $111 million in investment advisory and administration fees related to Alternatives in 2024 (forecasted), highlighting its asset management focus with a more specialized fee stream. JPMorgan Chase reported total lending- and deposit-related fees of $7,413 million for 2023, showing a strong emphasis on traditional banking services such as lending and deposits. Together, these disclosures illustrate differing strategic focuses: BAC's broad-based consumer and corporate fee generation, BLK's asset management specialization, and JPM's reliance on core banking fees.",

      "answer": "MA discusses transactional risks in the context of technological and regulatory challenges, including the potential negative impact of service outages on its real-time payments network, Vocalink, and the complexities of integrating multi-rail solutions. MET highlights transactional risks primarily through credit spread volatility, counterparty defaults, and equity market fluctuations, which affect its investment and insurance products' performance and cash flow stability. PYPL discloses transactional exposure through its foreign exchange contracts under master netting agreements, showing a potential offset of $102 million as of December 31, 2021, and indicating the financial impact of derivative settlements. Together, these perspectives illustrate how transaction-related risks manifest differently across payment networks, investment portfolios, and financial instruments, reflecting the diverse operational and financial dependencies on transactional systems.",

We have received, and we may in the future receive, notices or inquiries from patent holders (for example, other operating companies or non-practicing entities)  suggesting  that  we  may  be  infringing  certain  patents  or  that  we  need  to  license  the  use  of  their  patents  to  avoid infringement. Such notices may, among other things, threaten litigation against us or our customers or demand significant license fees.\n- Our ability to develop new technologies and reflect technological changes in our payments offerings will require resources, which may result in additional expenses.\n- We work with fintechs, technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) and traditional customers that use our technology to enhance payment safety and security and to deliver their payment-related products and services quickly and efficiently to consumers. Our inability to keep pace technologically could negatively impact the willingness of these customers to work with us, and could encourage them to use their own technology and compete against us.\n- Regulatory  or  government  requirements  could  require  us  to  host  and  deliver  certain  products  and  services  on-soil  in  certain markets, which would require us to alter our technology and delivery model, potentially resulting in additional expenses.\n- Various central banks are experimenting with digital currencies called Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC). CBDCs may be launched with their own networks to transfer money between participants. Policy and design considerations that governments adopt could impact the extent of our role in facilitating CBDC-based payment transactions, potentially impacting the transactions that we may process over our network.\n\nWe cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business, and our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate, develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. Failure to keep pace with these technological developments or otherwise bring to market products that reflect these technologies could lead to a decline in the use of our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Operating a real-time account-based payments network presents risks that could materially affect our business.\n\nU.K.  regulators  have  designated  Vocalink,  our  real-time  account-based  payments  network  platform,  to  be  a  'specified  service provider' and regulators in other countries may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of real-time account-based payments systems  in  similar  ways.  In  addition,  any  prolonged  service  outage  on  this  network  could  result  in  quickly  escalating  impacts, including potential intervention by the Bank of England and significant reputational risk to Vocalink and us. For a discussion of the regulatory risks related to our real-time account-based payments platform, see our risk factor in 'Risk Factors - Payments Industry Regulation' in this Part I, Item 1A. Furthermore, the complexity of this payment technology requires careful management to address security  vulnerabilities  that  are  different  from  those  faced  on  our  core  network.  Operational  difficulties,  such  as  the  temporary unavailability of our services or products, or security breaches on our real-time account-based payments network could cause a loss of business for these products and services, result in potential liability for us and adversely affect our reputation.\n\nWorking with new customers and end users as we expand our multi-rail solutions and integrated products and services can present operational and onboarding challenges, be costly and result in reputational damage if the new products or services do not perform as intended.\n\nThe payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry  standards  and  changing  customer  and  consumer  needs.  In  order  to  remain  competitive  and  meet  the  needs  of  the payments markets, we are continually involved in developing complex multi-rail solutions and diversifying our integrated products and services. These efforts carry the risks associated with any diversification initiative, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance  problems.  These  projects  also  carry  risks  associated  with  working  with  different  types  of  customers,  for  example organizations such as corporations that are not financial institutions and non-governmental organizations ('NGOs'), and end users other than those we have traditionally worked with. These differences may present new operational challenges in the development and implementation of our new products or services. These new customers are typically less regulated, and as a result, enhanced infrastructure and monitoring is required.\n\nOur failure to effectively design and deliver these multi-rail solutions and integrated products and services could make our other offerings less desirable to customers, or put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, if there is a delay in the implementation of our products or services or if our products or services do not perform as anticipated, or we are unable to adequately anticipate",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Credit Spread Risks\n\nChanges in credit spreads may result in market price volatility and cash flow variability. Market price volatility can make valuations  of  our  securities  difficult  if  trading  becomes  less  frequent,  which  may  require  us  to  add  to  our  reserves.  Market volatility may cause changes in credit spreads, defaults and a lack of pricing transparency. An increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks may increase our borrowing costs and decrease certain product fee income. A sustained decrease in credit spreads could reduce the yield on our future investments.\n\n## Equity Risks\n\nDownturns and volatility in equity markets may harm our savings and investment products' revenues and investment returns, where fee income is earned based upon the estimated fair value of our managed assets. Our variable annuity business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets may decrease these products' revenues and earnings. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline or stagnate.\n\nSustained declines in long-term equity returns or interest rates may harm the funding of our pension plans and other postretirement benefit obligations. An increase in equity markets could increase settlement payments on equity futures and total rate of return swaps ('TRRs'), which may increase our cash outflows and liquidity needs.\n\nThe timing of distributions from and valuations of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds depends on the performance of the underlying investments, distribution schedules, and the funds' need for cash. The amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period and significant volatility may harm our returns and net investment income. In addition, downturns or volatility in the equity markets may decrease the estimated fair value of our alternative investments and equity securities.\n\n## Real Estate Risks\n\nChanges in leasable commercial space supply and demand, pandemics and other public health issues, creditworthiness of tenants  and  partners,  capital  markets  volatility,  interest  rate  fluctuations,  commodity  prices,  farm  incomes,  housing  and commercial property market conditions, and real estate investment supply and demand may adversely impact our investments in commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and real estate and real estate joint ventures.\n\n## Obligor and Counterparty Risks\n\nOur general account investments in certain countries could be adversely affected by volatility resulting from local economic and political concerns, as well as volatility in specific sectors. Government entities may face budget deficits and other financial difficulties, which may harm the value of securities we hold issued by or under the auspices of such governments.\n\nThe  issuers  or  guarantors  of  fixed  income  securities  and  mortgage  loans  we  own  may  default  on  principal  and  interest payments  they  owe  us.  Additionally,  the  change  in  value  of  underlying  collateral  within  asset-backed  securities  ('ABS'), including mortgage-backed securities, may result in a default on principal and interest payments, reducing our cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, or other adverse events may reduce the estimated fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities and mortgage loans and increase the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio.\n\nMany  of  our  transactions  with  counterparties  such  as  brokers  and  dealers,  central  clearinghouses,  commercial  banks, investment banks, hedge funds, investment funds, reinsurers and other financial institutions expose us to the risk of counterparty default. Such credit risk may be exacerbated if we cannot realize on the collateral held by us in secured transactions or cannot liquidate such collateral at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Furthermore, potential  action  by  governments  and  regulatory  bodies,  such  as  controlling  investment,  nationalization,  conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks' credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. These may cause losses or impairments to the carrying value of our investments.\n\nOur efforts to manage our total exposure to a single counterparty or limited number of counterparties within or among any of our investment, derivative, treasury, and reinsurance relationships, which we adjust from time to time, may not completely or adequately mitigate counterparty risks.",

      "answer": "Bank of America notes that higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of its debt securities classified as available for sale, adversely affecting accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under Basel 3 capital rules. JPMorgan Chase highlights that macroeconomic and geopolitical events, including inflation, recession, and regulatory shifts, could reduce its liquidity and capital levels due to market volatility and credit loss pressures. Charles Schwab indicates that its ability to migrate IDA balances to its balance sheet is dependent on maintaining sufficient capital levels, with constraints outlined in the 2023 IDA agreement. Synthesizing these perspectives, BAC is sensitive to rate-driven valuation impacts under Basel 3, JPM faces broader macroeconomic and regulatory-driven capital pressures, and SCHW\u2019s capital flexibility is contractually constrained by off-balance-sheet deposit arrangements.",

BAC includes Earnings Per Common Share as a dedicated note (Note 15) in its financial statements, suggesting a structured and detailed approach to its disclosure. MET provides a detailed explanation of the computation methodology for Earnings Per Common Share, including basic and diluted EPS calculations and the impact of stock-based awards, emphasizing methodological clarity. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies treat EPS as a key financial metric, they differ in the depth and framing of their disclosures\u2014AXP by listing it among core accounting policies, BAC by isolating it for focused attention, and MET by elaborating on its calculation mechanics.",

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Earnings Per Common Share\n\nBasic earnings per common share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares, or their equivalent, outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise or issuance of stock-based awards using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, exercise or issuance of stock-based awards is assumed to occur with the proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nChanges to GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') in the form of Accounting Standards Updates ('ASUs') to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. The following tables provide a description of ASUs recently issued by the FASB and the impact of their adoption on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe table below describes the impacts of the ASUs recently adopted by the Company.\n\n",

      "question": "How do AIG, BK, and MET each address the impact of preferred stock dividends on their capital management strategies, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to shareholder returns?",
      "answer": "AIG discloses specific preferred stock dividend payments of $29 million in both 2021 and 2020, which are subtracted from net income to determine income attributable to common shareholders, indicating a consistent and transparent approach to preferred dividend obligations. BK highlights that its ability to return capital to shareholders, including preferred stock dividends, is constrained by regulatory requirements and its Board's discretion, signaling a more cautious and compliance-driven strategy. MET outlines structural constraints tied to 'dividend stopper' provisions in its preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures, which can restrict both preferred and common stock dividends during financial stress, revealing a highly conditional and risk-sensitive approach to capital distribution. Collectively, these perspectives show that while all three firms are subject to regulatory and financial constraints, they differ in how they disclose and manage the implications of preferred stock dividends on overall capital strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Preferred Stock Dividends: AIG explicitly quantifies preferred stock dividends at $29 million in both 2021 and 2020, directly showing their impact on net income attributable to common shareholders.",
        "Hop 2: BK \u2192 Preferred Stock Dividends: BK notes that its capital return policy, including preferred stock dividends, is subject to regulatory limits and Board discretion, indicating a risk-averse and regulatory-dependent strategy.",
        "Hop 3: MET \u2192 Preferred Stock Dividends: MET emphasizes 'dividend stopper' provisions that restrict both preferred and common dividends under financial stress, revealing a conditional and legally bound capital policy."

For purposes of this discussion, 'junior subordinated debentures' are deemed to include MetLife, Inc.'s Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities, as discussed in Note 15.\n\n## 'Dividend Stopper' Provisions in the Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures\n\nIf MetLife, Inc. has not paid the full dividends on its preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period, MetLife, Inc. may  not  repurchase  or  pay  dividends  on  its  common  stock  during  a  dividend  period  under  so-called  'dividend  stopper' provisions. Further, MetLife, Inc.'s Series A preferred stock and its junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would suspend the payment of preferred stock dividends and interest on junior subordinated debentures if MetLife, Inc. fails to meet certain RBC ratio, net income and stockholders' equity tests at specified times, except to the extent of the net proceeds from the issuance of certain securities during specified periods. If Series A preferred stock dividends or interest on junior subordinated debentures  are  not  paid,  certain  provisions  in  those  instruments  (including  under  'dividend  stopper'  provisions)  may  restrict MetLife, Inc. from repurchasing its common or preferred stock or paying dividends on its common or preferred stock and interest on its junior subordinated debentures.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase each disclose or manage their exposure to unfunded lending commitments, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to credit risk in wholesale and commercial portfolios?",
      "answer": "Bank of America actively manages unfunded lending commitments through credit derivatives and risk mitigation strategies, including purchasing credit protection for both funded and unfunded portions of exposures. Citigroup discloses specific unfunded exposure amounts across various asset classes, such as $13,185 million in asset-based financing and $566 million in non-agency-sponsored mortgage securitizations. JPMorgan Chase provides the carrying value and estimated fair value of wholesale lending-related commitments, indicating a focus on transparency in credit risk reporting. Together, these approaches reflect varying degrees of emphasis on quantitative disclosure, hedging strategies, and portfolio segmentation in managing unfunded credit exposure.",

( 3)\n\n## Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial  position.  As  part  of  th e  overall  cred it  risk  a ssessment,  our  commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary , adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow , risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty . In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country , industry and single-name concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the  total  borrower  or  counterparty  relationship.  We  use  a  variety  of  tools  to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their  current  ability  to  pay .  For  more  information  on  our  accounting  policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming  status and  net charge-offs for  the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations\n\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review , measure and  manage  concentrations  of  credit  exposure  by  industry ,  product,  geography , customer  relationship  and  loan  size.  We  also  review ,  measure  and  manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within  our  non-U.S.  portfolio,  we  evaluate  exposures  by  region  and  by  country . Tables 32, 34 and 3 7 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to  manage the  size  and  risk  profile  of  th e  commercial  credit  portfolio.  For  more information on our industry concentrations, see T able 34 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management - Industry Concentrations on page 67.\n\nWe account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management  purposes,  that  exceed  our  single-name  credit  risk  concentration guidelines  under  the  fair  value  option.  Lending  commitments,  both  funded  and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging  activity .  In  ad d ition,  we  p urch a se  cred it  p rotection  to  cover  th e  fund ed portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. T o lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added  within  an  industry ,  borrower  or  counterparty  group  by  selling  protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.\n\nIn addition, we are a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  other  countries.  As  a  member ,  we  may  be required  to  pay  a  pro-rata  share  of  the  losses  incurred  by  some  of  these organizations  as  a  result  of  another  member  default  and  under  other  loss scenarios. For more information, see Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Commercial Credit Portfolio\n\nOutstanding commercial loans and leases increased $3 7 .1 billion during 202 4 due to growth in U.S. and Non-U.S. commercial, primarily in Global Markets and Global Banking. During  202 4,  commercial  credit  quality  deteriorated  as  reservable criticized  utilized   exp osure  increased  across  a  broad  range  of  industries,  and nonperforming  commercial  loans  increased  primarily  driven  by  U.S.  commercial. Commercial  net  charge-offs  increased  $1.1  billion  to  $1.8  billion  during  202 4 primarily due to higher losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio and U.S. commercial portfolio.\n\nWith the exception of the office property type, which is further discussed in the Commercial  Real  Estate  section  herein,  credit  quality  of  commercial  real  estate borrowers has remained relatively stable since December 3 1, 2023; however, we are closely monitoring emerging trends and borrower performance in a higher interest rate environment.

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\nrisk-weighted assets related to de minimis positions, those adjustments have not significantly impacted our risk-based capital ratios nor have they had a current impact on CSC's activities.\n\nThe U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rule is designed to promote resiliency of the banking sector by requiring that certain large U.S. banking organizations (Covered Companies) maintain a liquidity risk profile which ensures that they have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), such as central bank reserves, certain government securities, and eligible corporate debt that can be converted easily and quickly to cash, to survive a significant stress event lasting 30 days. The LCR rule requires Covered Companies, including Schwab, to maintain an amount of HQLA that are unencumbered and controlled by the Covered Company's liquidity management function sufficient to meet a designated percentage of their total stressed net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period, as calculated in accordance with the LCR rule. Schwab is subject to the LCR and public disclosure requirement on a consolidated basis. On a quarterly basis the Company is required to disclose the average daily LCR over the quarter, and the Company also discloses quantitative and qualitative information over certain portions of the Company's LCR components. Under the LCR rule, Schwab is required to maintain HQLA to cover 100% of the total stressed net cash outflows on a daily basis. In addition, HQLA that are held at the Company's bank subsidiaries in excess of the subsidiaries' total net cash outflows, and are not transferable to non-bank affiliates, are excluded by rule from the Company's eligible HQLA.\n\nThe final Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) rule was jointly adopted by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC to strengthen the resilience of large bank and savings and loan holding companies by requiring them to maintain a minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of the holding company's assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon. The requirement is expressed as a ratio of a banking organization's available stable funding (ASF) to its required stable funding (RSF). Under the NSFR rule, CSC and our banking subsidiaries are required to maintain ASF in an amount equal to 100% of its RSF on an ongoing, daily basis. CSC is also required to publicly disclose its quarterly NSFR on a semi-annual basis.\n\n## Capital Stress Testing\n\nUnder the current Federal Reserve capital stress testing rules, savings and loan holding companies that are Category III banking organizations and state member banks with total consolidated assets over $250 billion are required to disclose the results of company-run stress tests in even-numbered years. In the most recent cycle in 2024, CSC and CSB conducted company-run stress tests, reported the results of their stress testing to the Federal Reserve, and published a summary of their stress test results.\n\nPursuant to the Federal Reserve's requirements, Category III savings and loan holding companies are also subject to an annual supervisory stress testing requirement in which the Federal Reserve conducts its own stress testing analysis to evaluate the ability of a holding company to absorb losses in specified economic and financial conditions over a nine-quarter planning horizon using such analytical techniques as the agency determines are appropriate. This supervisory stress testing requirement went into effect for CSC beginning with the 2022 stress testing cycle.\n\nPursuant to the Federal Reserve's requirements, savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, including CSC, are subject to an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, which requires submission of an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve. These requirements also impose a stress capital buffer requirement, floored at 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. In June 2024, the Company received the results of the Federal Reserve's 2024 CCAR. These results included the Federal Reserve's estimate of CSC's minimum capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario for the nine-quarter horizon beginning December 31, 2023 and ending March 31, 2026. Based on these results, CSC's calculated stress capital buffer remains below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a stress capital buffer at the 2.5% floor. This 2.5% stress capital buffer became applicable on October 1, 2024. See Part II - Item 8 - Note 24 for additional information regarding our capital requirements.\n\n## Additional Enhanced Prudential Standards\n\nIn addition to the capital stress testing regime discussed above, the Federal Reserve's enhanced prudential standards rules also extend the applicability of certain additional enhanced prudential standards to large savings and loan holding companies, with the specific requirements tailored based on the same four-category framework utilized in the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules. These additional enhanced prudential standards, applicable to large U.S. bank holding companies under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), include: risk management and risk committee requirements; liquidity risk management, liquidity stress testing, and liquidity buffer requirements; and single",

Morgan Stanley uses loss severity as a key input in its valuation models for mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt, particularly when benchmarking to comparable instruments and modeling expected credit losses. The synthesis reveals that while all three firms rely on loss severity as a core component of credit risk assessment, they differ in how they integrate it\u2014AIG focuses on impairment triggers and write-downs, MetLife emphasizes scenario-based recovery expectations, and Morgan Stanley prioritizes benchmarking and market-based valuation adjustments.",

No allowance is established in these situations and any previously recorded allowance is reversed. The new cost basis is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. When assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fix ed maturity  security  before recov ery  of its amortiz ed cost basis, management evaluates relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our investment portfolio, sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to take advantage of favorable pricing.\n\nFor fix ed maturity  securities for which a decline in the fair v alue below the amortiz ed cost is due to credit related factors, an allowance is established for the difference between the estimated recoverable value and amortized cost with a corresponding charge to Net realized gains (losses). The allowance for credit losses is limited to the difference between amortized cost and fair value. The estimated recoverable value is the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, as determined by management. The difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not associated with credit related factors is presented in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of fix ed maturity  securities on which an allowance for credit losses was previously recognized (a separate component of A OCI). A ccrued interest is excluded from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses.\n\nWhen estimating future cash flows for structured fixed maturity securities (e.g., RM BS, CM BS, CLO, A BS) management considers the historical performance of underlying assets and available market information as well as bond-specific structural considerations, such as credit enhancement and the priority of payment structure of the security. In addition, the process of estimating future cash flows includes, but is not limited to, the following critical inputs, which vary by asset class:\n\n- Current delinquency rates;\n- Expected default rates and the timing of such defaults;\n- Loss severity and the timing of any recovery; and\n- Expected prepayment speeds.\n\nWhen estimating future cash flows for corporate, municipal and sovereign fixed maturity securities determined to be credit impaired, management considers:\n\n- Expected default rates and the timing of such defaults;\n- Loss severity and the timing of any recovery; and\n- Scenarios specific to the issuer and the security, which may also include estimates of outcomes of corporate restructurings, political and macroeconomic factors, stability  and financial strength of the issuer, the v alue of any  secondary  sources of repayment and the disposition of assets.\n\nWe consider severe price declines in our assessment of potential credit impairments. We may also modify our model inputs when we determine that price movements in certain sectors are indicative of factors not captured by the cash flow models.\n\nUnder the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, credit losses are reassessed each period. The allowance for credit losses and the corresponding charge to Net realized gains (losses) can be reversed if conditions change, however, the allowance for credit losses will never be reduced below zero. When we determine that all or a portion of a fix ed maturity  security  is uncollectable, the uncollectable amortiz ed cost amount is written off with a corresponding reduction to the allowance for credit losses. If we collect cash flows that were previously written off, the recovery is recognized by recording a gain in Net realized gains (losses).\n\n128\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

Investments (continued)\n\nThe methodology and significant inputs used to determine the amount of credit loss are as follows:\n\n- The Company calculates the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate is generally the effective interest rate of the security at the time of purchase for fixed-rate securities and the spot rate at the date of evaluation of credit loss for floating-rate securities.\n- When determining collectability and the period over which value is expected to recover, the Company applies considerations utilized in its overall credit loss evaluation process which incorporates information regarding the specific security, fundamentals of the industry and geographic area in which the security issuer operates, and overall macroeconomic conditions. Projected future cash flows are estimated using assumptions derived from management's single best estimate, the most likely outcome in a range of possible outcomes, after giving consideration to a variety of variables that include, but are not limited to: payment terms of the security, the likelihood that the issuer can service the interest and principal payments, the quality and amount of any credit enhancements, the security's position within the capital structure of the issuer, possible corporate restructurings or asset sales by the issuer, any private and public sector programs to restructure foreign government securities and municipals, and changes to the rating of the security or the issuer by rating agencies.\n- Additional considerations are made when assessing the features that apply to certain Structured Products including, but not limited to: the quality of underlying collateral, historical performance of the underlying loan obligors, historical rent and vacancy levels, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors,  ex pected  prepayment speeds, current and forecasted loss severity, consideration of the payment terms of the underlying loans or assets backing a particular security, changes in the quality of credit enhancement and the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security.\n\nWith respect to securities that have attributes of debt and equity ('perpetual hybrid securities'), consideration is given in the credit loss analysis as to whether there  has  been  any  deterioration  in  the  credit  of  the  issuer  and  the  likelihood  of  recovery  in  value  of  the  securities  that  are  in  a  severe  unrealized  loss  position. Consideration is also given as to whether any perpetual hybrid securities with an unrealized loss, regardless of credit rating, have deferred any dividend payments.\n\nIn periods subsequent to the recognition of an initial ACL on a security, the Company reassesses credit loss quarterly. Subsequent increases or decreases in the expected cash flow from the security result in corresponding decreases or increases in the ACL which are recognized in earnings and reported within net investment gains (losses); however, the previously recorded ACL is not reduced to an amount below zero. Full or partial write-offs are deducted from the ACL in the period the security, or a portion thereof, is considered uncollectible. Recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded to the ACL in the period received. When the Company has the intent-to-sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, any ACL is written off and the amortized cost is written down to estimated fair value through a charge within net investment gains (losses), which becomes the new amortized cost of the security.\n\n## Evaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS in an Unrealized Loss Position\n\nGross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL increased $5.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 to $31.2 billion primarily due to an increase in interest rates and the impact of weakening foreign currencies on certain non-functional currency denominated fixed maturity securities.\n\nAs shown in the table above, most of the gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL that have been in a continuous gross unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater at December 31, 2024 relate to investment grade securities. These unrealized losses are principally due to narrowing credit spreads since purchase and, with respect to fix ed-rate securities, rising interest rates since purchase.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, $552 million of gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL that have been in a continuous gross unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater on below investment grade securities were concentrated in the consumer, communications, and finance sectors within corporate securities and in foreign government securities. These unrealized losses are the result of significantly wider credit spreads resulting from higher risk premiums since purchase, largely due to economic and market uncertainty and, with respect to fixed-rate securities, rising interest rates since purchase.",

When evaluating the comparable instruments for use in the valuation of each security, security collateral-specific attributes, including payment priority, credit enhancement levels, type of collateral, delinquency rates and loss severity, are  considered.  In  addition,  for  RMBS  borrowers,  FICO  scores  and  the level of documentation for the loan are considered.\n- Market standard cash flow models may be utilized to model the specific collateral  composition  and  cash  flow  structure  of  each  transaction.  Key inputs to these models are market spreads, forecasted credit losses, and default and prepayment rates for each asset category.\n- Valuation levels of RMBS and CMBS indices are used as an additional data point for benchmarking purposes or to price outright index positions.\n\nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\n- Level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments\n- Level 3-if external prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or not  supported  by  market  liquidity  or  if  the  comparability  assessment involves significant subjectivity related to property type differences, cash flows, performance or other inputs\n\n## Loans and Lending Commitments\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- Fair  value  of  corporate  loans  is  determined  using  recently  executed transactions,  market  price  quotations  (where  observable),  implied  yields from comparable debt, market observable CDS spread levels obtained from independent  external  parties  adjusted  for  any  basis  difference  between cash and derivative instruments, along with proprietary valuation models and default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.\n- Fair value of contingent corporate lending commitments is determined by using  executed  transactions  on  comparable  loans  and  the  anticipated market  price  based  on  pricing  indications  from  syndicate  banks  and customers. The valuation of loans and lending commitments also takes into account fee income that is considered an attribute of the contract.\n- Fair value of mortgage loans is determined using observable prices based on  transactional  data  or  third-party  pricing  for  comparable  instruments, when available.\n- Where  position-specific  external  prices  are  not  observable,  fair  value  is estimated  based  on  benchmarking  to  prices  and  rates  observed  in  the primary market for similar loan\n- or borrower types or based on the present value of expected future cash flows  using  the  Firm's  best  available  estimates  of  the  key  assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved or a methodology that utilizes the capital structure and credit spreads of recent comparable securitization transactions.\n- Fair  value  of  equity  margin  loans  is  determined  by  discounting  future interest cash flows, net of potential losses resulting from large downward price  movements  of  the  underlying  margin  loan  collateral.  The  potential losses  are  modeled  using  the  margin  loan  rate,  which  is  calibrated  from market observable CDS spreads, implied debt yields or volatility metrics of the loan collateral.\n\nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\n- Level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments\n- Level  3-in  instances  where  prices  or  significant  spread  inputs  are unobservable or not supported by market liquidity or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity\n\n## Corporate and Other Debt\n\nCorporate Bonds\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- Fair value is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations,  bond  spreads  and  CDS  spreads  obtained  from  independent external  parties,  such  as  vendors  and  brokers,  adjusted  for  any  basis difference between cash and derivative instruments.\n- The spread data used is for the same maturity as the bond. If the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that references comparable issuers are  used. When  position-specific  external  price  data  is  not observable,  fair  value  is  determined  based  on  either  benchmarking  to comparable instruments or cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single-name  CDS  spreads  and  recovery  rates  or  loss  given  default  as significant inputs.\n\nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\n- Level  2-if  value  based  on  observable  market  data  for  comparable instruments\n- Level  3-in  instances  where  prices  or  significant  spread  inputs  are unobservable  or  if  the  comparability  assessment  involves  significant subjectivity\n\n## CDOs\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- The  Firm  holds  cash  CDOs  that  typically  reference  a  tranche  of  an underlying synthetic portfolio of single-name  CDS spreads collateralized by  corporate  bonds  ('CLN')  or  cash  portfolio  of  ABS/loans  ('assetbacked CDOs').\n- Credit correlation, a primary input used to determine the fair value of CLNs, is  usually  unobservable  and  derived  using  a  benchmarking  technique. Other  model  inputs,  such  as  credit  spreads,  including  collateral  spreads and interest rates, are typically observable.\n- Asset-backed CDOs are valued based on an evaluation of the market and model input parameters sourced from comparable instruments as indicated by market activity.",

      "answer": "Bank of America defines VaR as a model that simulates portfolio value under hypothetical scenarios to estimate potential losses with a given confidence level based on historical data, focusing on trading portfolios. Citigroup includes VaR as part of its Market Risk of Trading Portfolios and references it in the context of factor sensitivities and stress testing, indicating a broader integration into risk analytics. Goldman Sachs uses a single VaR model for both risk management and regulatory capital calculations, distinguishing between a 95% one-day VaR for internal purposes and a 99% ten-day VaR for regulatory market risk capital requirements, with further distinctions in the treatment of intraday activity for VaR exceptions. The synthesis reveals that while all three use VaR as a core metric, their modeling philosophies, regulatory alignment, and operationalization vary significantly.",

RWAs  are  calculated  in  accordance  with  both  the  Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit  RWAs  are  calculated  based  on  measures  of  exposure,  which  are then risk weighted under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules:\n\n- The  Standardized  Capital  Rules  apply  prescribed  risk-weights,  which depend largely on the type of counterparty. The exposure measures for derivatives  and  securities  financing  transactions  are  based  on  specific formulas which take certain factors into consideration.\n- Under the Advanced  Capital  Rules,  the  firm  computes  risk-weights  for wholesale and retail credit exposures in accordance with the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The exposure measures for derivatives and  securities  financing  transactions  are  computed  utilizing  internal models.\n- For both Standardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the risk-weights for securitizations  and  equities  are  based  on  specific  required  formulaic approaches.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nRWAs for market risk in accordance with the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules are generally consistent. Market RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure which include the following:\n\n- Value-at-Risk  (V aR)  is  the  potential  loss  in  value  of  trading  assets  and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and  liabilities accounted  for  at fair value,  due  to  adverse  market movements  over  a  defined  time  horizon  with  a  specified  confidence level.\n\nFor both risk management purposes and regulatory capital calculations, the firm uses a single V aR model which captures risks, including those related  to  interest  rates,  equity  prices,  currency  rates  and  commodity prices. However, V aR used for risk management purposes differs from VaR  used  for  regulatory  capital  requirements  (regulatory  V aR)  due  to differences in time horizons, confidence levels and the scope  of positions on which V aR is calculated. For risk management purposes, a 95% one-day V aR is used, whereas for regulatory capital requirements, a 99% 10-day V aR is used to determine Market RWAs and a  99% oneday VaR is used to determine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily  net  revenues  used  to  determine  risk  management  V aR  exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the V aR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the  Capital  Framework requires that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory V aR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to  be  positive  by  their  nature. As  a  result,  there  may  be  differences  in the  number  of  V aR  exceptions  and  the  amount  of  daily  net  revenues calculated  for  regulatory  V aR  compared  to  the  amounts  calculated  for risk management VaR.\n\nThe firm's positional losses observed on a single day exceeded its 99% one-day  regulatory  V aR  on  two  occasions  during  2024  and  on  one occasion during 2023. There was no change in the firm's V aR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs;\n\n- Stressed V aR is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as  well  as  certain  investments,  loans,  and  other  financial  assets  and liabilities  accounted  for  at  fair  value,  during  a  period  of  significant market stress;\n- Incremental risk is the potential loss in value of non-securitized positions due to the default or credit migration of issuers of financial instruments over a one-year time horizon;",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, Capital One, and MetLife differ in their exposure to nonperforming loans, and what does this reveal about their respective credit risk profiles in 2023?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reported $2.7 billion in nonperforming loans at the end of 2023, with a notable increase in commercial nonperforming loans driven by the commercial real estate sector. Capital One had $1.528 billion in total nonperforming loans, with $761 million from commercial banking, including $335 million in commercial real estate loans without an allowance. MetLife, in contrast, reported only $5 million in nonperforming loans in 2023, a significant decline from $46 million in 2022, indicating a much lower credit risk exposure. These differences suggest that Bank of America faces higher credit risk, particularly in commercial real estate, Capital One maintains moderate exposure with a focus on commercial and industrial lending, and MetLife maintains a conservative credit profile with minimal nonperforming assets.",

      "answer": "AIG reported a significant decline in performance for its Asset Management segment in 2023, with an adjusted pre-tax loss of $114 million compared to a pre-tax income of $511 million in 2022, indicating a negative impact on its financials. BLK operates entirely within the Asset Management segment, emphasizing its consolidated business approach and deriving total revenue from this area, which underscores its core strategic focus. JPM, while not disclosing specific figures for Asset Management in the provided excerpt, includes it within its broader financials, suggesting a more diversified approach where Asset Management contributes alongside other business lines. The contrast in performance and structure reveals AIG is struggling with its asset management operations, BLK is fully committed to it, and JPM integrates it within a broader financial services portfolio.",

        "Hop 2: BLK \u2192 Asset Management: BLK operates entirely within the Asset Management segment, with all revenue derived from this business line, highlighting its strategic focus and operational consolidation.",
        "Hop 3: JPM \u2192 Asset Management: JPM includes Asset Management within its broader financial operations, though specific figures are not disclosed in the excerpt, suggesting a less transparent or more integrated approach compared to BLK."

      "answer": "AIG transfers certain private placement corporate debt and ABS into Level 3 due to limited market pricing information, using internal assumptions to adjust inputs. AXP uses a Monte Carlo Simulation with inputs like volatility and risk-neutral return for its Level 3 embedded derivative in GBT JerseyCo Limited shares. BAC applies extrapolation techniques and unobservable inputs for OTC derivatives where market data is sparse, incorporating credit risk and funding valuation adjustments (FVA). Collectively, this shows varying degrees of reliance on Level 3 valuations, with AIG focusing on market liquidity assumptions, AXP on equity-based modeling, and BAC on counterparty and funding risk adjustments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n\n## 8. Investments (continued)\n\nThe methodology and significant inputs used to determine the amount of credit loss are as follows:\n\n- The Company calculates the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate is generally the effective interest rate of the security at the time of purchase for fixedrate securities and the spot rate at the date of evaluation of credit loss for floating-rate securities.\n- When  determining  collectability  and  the  period  over  which  value  is  expected  to  recover,  the  Company  applies considerations utilized in its overall credit loss evaluation process which incorporates information regarding the specific security, fundamentals  of the industry and  geographic  area in which  the security issuer operates, and  overall macroeconomic  conditions.  Projected  future  cash  flows  are  estimated  using  assumptions  derived  from  management's single best estimate, the most likely outcome in a range of possible outcomes, after giving consideration to a variety of variables that include, but are not limited to: payment terms of the security; the likelihood that the issuer can service the interest  and  principal  payments;  the  quality  and  amount  of  any  credit  enhancements;  the  security's  position  within  the capital structure of the issuer; possible corporate restructurings or asset sales by the issuer; any private and public sector programs  to  restructure  foreign  government  securities  and  municipals;  and  changes  to  the  rating  of  the  security  or  the issuer by rating agencies.\n- Additional considerations are made when assessing the unique features that apply to certain Structured Products including, but not limited to: the quality of underlying collateral, historical performance of the underlying loan obligors, historical rent and vacancy levels, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors, expected prepayment speeds, current  and  forecasted  loss  severity,  consideration  of  the  payment  terms  of  the  underlying  loans  or  assets  backing  a particular security, changes in the quality of credit enhancement and the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security.\n\nWith respect to securities that have attributes of debt and equity ('perpetual hybrid securities'), consideration is given in the credit loss analysis as to whether there has been any deterioration in the credit of the issuer and the likelihood of recovery in value of the securities that are in a severe unrealized loss position. Consideration is also given as to whether any perpetual hybrid securities with an unrealized loss, regardless of credit rating, have deferred any dividend payments.\n\nAfter the adoption of credit loss guidance on January 1, 2020, in periods subsequent to the recognition of an initial ACL on a security, the Company reassesses credit loss quarterly. Subsequent increases or decreases in the expected cash flow from the security result in corresponding decreases or increases in the ACL which are recognized in earnings and reported within net investment gains (losses); however, the previously recorded ACL is not reduced to an amount below zero. Full or partial writeoffs  are  deducted  from  the ACL  in  the  period  the  security,  or  a  portion  thereof,  is  considered  uncollectible.  Recoveries  of amounts previously written off are recorded to the ACL in the period received. When the Company has the intent-to-sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, any ACL is written off and the amortized cost is written down to estimated fair value through a charge within net investment gains (losses), which becomes the new amortized cost of the security.\n\nMethodologies used during the year ended December 31, 2019 to evaluate the recoverability of a security in an unrealized loss position using OTTI guidance were similar to those used after the adoption of credit loss guidance on January 1, 2020, except: (i) the length of time estimated fair value had been below amortized cost was considered for securities, and (ii) for nonfunctional currency denominated securities, the impact from weakening non-functional currencies on securities that were near maturity was considered in the evaluation. In addition, measurement methodologies were similar, except: (i) a fair value floor was not utilized to limit the credit loss recognized in earnings, (ii) the amortized cost of securities was adjusted for the OTTI to the expected recoverable amount and an ACL was not utilized, (iii) subsequent to a credit loss being recognized, increases in expected cash flows from the security did not result in an immediate increase in valuation recognized in earnings through net investment gains (losses) from reduction of the ACL instead such increases in value were recorded as unrecognized unrealized gains in OCI, and (iv) in periods subsequent to the recognition of OTTI on a security, the Company accounted for the impaired security  as  if  it  had  been  purchased  on  the  measurement  date  of  the  impairment;  accordingly,  the  discount  (or  reduced premium) based on the new cost basis was accreted over the remaining term of the security in a prospective manner based on the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows.",

      "answer": "AIG reports $119 million in 'Other Loans' with a 100% allowance coverage for credit losses, indicating a conservative risk posture. C includes 'Other Loans' within its 'Personal, small business and other' category, where $16,442 million of managed loans show a low \u226590 days delinquency ratio of 0.22% and a net charge-off ratio of 1.02%, suggesting moderate risk. SCHW categorizes 'Other Loans' at $399 million, with $330 million maturing within 1 to 5 years, indicating a relatively short-duration exposure with unspecified delinquency or loss metrics.

As a financial holding company , the Corporation is subject to capital adequacy  rules  issued  by  the  Federal  Reserve.  The  Corporation's  banking  entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.\n\nThe  Corporation  and  its  primary  banking  entity  affiliate,  BANA,  are  Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As Advanced approaches institutions, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The  approach  that  yields  the  lower  ratio  is  used  to  assess  capital  adequacy , including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.\n\nThe  Corporation  is  required  to  maintain  a  minimum  supplementary  leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The Corporation's insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.\n\nThe following table presents capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 3 1, 2024 and 2023 for the Corporation and BANA.",

          "chunk_text": "considered 'well capitalized.' Citibank was 'well capitalized' as of December 31, 2024. Furthermore, to be 'well capitalized' under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0% and not be subject to a FRB directive to maintain higher capital levels.\n\n## Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning\n\nCiti is subject to an annual assessment by the FRB as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs: the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST).\n\nFor the largest and most complex firms, such as Citi, CCAR includes a qualitative evaluation of a firm's abilities to determine its capital needs on a forward-looking basis. In conducting the qualitative assessment, the FRB evaluates firms' capital planning practices, focusing on six areas of capital planning: governance, risk management, internal controls, capital policies, incorporating stressful conditions and events, and estimating impact on capital positions. As part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates Citi's capital adequacy, capital adequacy process and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common share repurchases. The FRB assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks.\n\nAll CCAR firms, including Citi, are subject to a rigorous evaluation of their capital planning process. Firms with weak practices may be subject to a deficient supervisory rating, and potentially an enforcement action, for failing to meet supervisory expectations. For additional information regarding CCAR, see 'Risk Factors-Strategic Risks' below.\n\nDFAST is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi's regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the FRB and the general public as to how Citi's regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the FRB. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the FRB.\n\nBoth CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under two supervisory scenarios (baseline and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\nIn addition, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under several scenarios on Citibank's regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as to how Citibank's regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank's capital planning process.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank are required to disclose the results of their company-run stress tests.",

          "chunk_text": "impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices. The intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and certain subsidiaries and how they  impact  financial  resiliency ,  which  provides  confidence  to  management, regulators and our investors.\n\n## Contingency Planning\n\nWe  have  developed  and  maintain  comprehensive  contingency  plans  that  are designed  to  prepare  us  in  advance  to  respond  in  the  event  of  potential  adverse economic, operational, financial  or  market  stress  conditions.  These  contingency plans  include  our  Financial  Contingency  and  Recovery  Plan,  which  provides monitoring,  escalation,  actions  and  routines  designed  to  enable  us  to  increase capital and/or liq uid ity , access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options that include asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, and other risk reducing strategies at various levels of capital or liq uid ity d e p le tio n d uring a  p e rio d  o f stre ss. W e  a lso  m a inta in a  R e so lutio n Pla n to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of Bank of America.\n\n## Strategic Risk Management\n\nStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity , compliance, operational and reputational risks. This  risk  results  from  incorrect  assumptions  about  external  or  internal  factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond  in  a  timely  manner  to  changes  in  the  regulatory ,  macroeconomic  or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate, such as competitor  actions,  changing  customer  preferences,  product  obsolescence  and technology  developments,  including  rapid  advances  in  artificial  intelligence  (AI), such as machine learning and generative AI.\n\nAn aspect of strategic risk is the risk that the Corporation's capital levels are not adequate  to  meet  minimum  regulatory  requirements  and  support  execution  of business activities or absorb losses from risks during normal or adverse economic and market conditions. As such, capital risk is managed in parallel to strategic risk.\n\nWe  manage  strategic  risk  through  the  Strategic  Risk  Enterprise  Policy  and integration  into  the  strategic  planning  process,  among  other  activities.  Our strategic  plan  is  consistent  with  our  risk  appetite,  capital  plan  and  liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks impacting each business.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk Appetite Statement. With oversight by the Board, senior management directs the lines of business to execute our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. The executive management  team  monitors  business  performance  throughout  the  year  and provides the Board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or alternative  actions  need to be considered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the strategic plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis.\n\nSignificant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by the Board. At the business level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services, regulatory change and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where required. With oversight by the Board and the ERC, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving  the  targeted  risk  appetite,  shareholder  returns  and  maintaining  the targeted  financial  strength.  Proprietary  models  are  used  to  measure  the  capital requirements  for  credit,  country ,  market,  operational  and  strategic  risks.  The allocated capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of  each  business  in  approving  strategic  and  financial  operating  plans.  The businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies, and price products and transactions.\n\n## Capital Management\n\nThe  Corporation  manages  its  capital  position  so  that  its  capital  is  more  than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. Additionally , we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities,  meet  obligations  to  creditors  and  counterparties,  maintain  ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary , remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management  is  integrated into our risk  and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits.\n\nWe conduct  an  Internal  Capital  Adequacy  Assessment  Process  (ICAAP)  on  a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking assessment of our projected capital needs  and  resources,  incorporating  earnings,  balance  sheet  and  risk  forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. We utilize periodic stress  tests  to  assess  the  potential  impacts  to  our  balance  sheet,  earnings, regulatory  capital  and  liquidity  under  a  variety  of  stress  scenarios.  We  perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in  our  forecasts  or  stress  tests.  We  assess  the  potential  capital  impacts  of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP results  and  provides  documented quarterly  assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees.\n\nWe periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For more information, see Business Segment Operations on page 35.\n\n## CCAR and Capital Planning\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing capital planning and the stress capital buffer (SCB) requirement, which include supervisory stress testing by the Federal Reserve. Based on 202 4 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test results, our SCB is 3.2 percent effective from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025.",

These committees, including the  Capital  Management Committee and the ERC, regularly review actual and projected capital levels (under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios) and our annual capital plan in accordance with our capital policy. The Capital Management Committee is comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer ('CFO'), Treasurer, and CRO. The ERC is also comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.'s CFO, CRO and Chief Investment Officer.\n\nOur Board of Directors and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy. The capital policy sets forth, among other things, minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process. All capital actions, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan, capital targets or capital policy, are reviewed by the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors prior to obtaining full Board of Directors approval.

      "answer": "American Express emphasizes maintaining a strong liquidity profile to support its proprietary card-issuing business and meet regulatory requirements, aiming for diversity in funding sources including deposits, unsecured debt, and securitizations. MetLife reports holding $5.2 billion in cash and liquid assets at the holding companies, exceeding its $3.0\u2013$4.0 billion target, and highlights its capital stress testing and readiness for economic volatility. Visa states confidence in its liquidity position to meet needs beyond 12 months, based on cash flow forecasts and ongoing assessments of economic conditions. Comparatively, AXP focuses on funding diversification, MET emphasizes excess liquidity cushion, and V stresses forward-looking liquidity adequacy, revealing distinct risk mitigation strategies across financial services subsectors.",

      "question": "How do American Express (AXP), Capital One (COF), and Charles Schwab (SCHW) each characterize their exposure to credit risk in their loan portfolios, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to loan quality management?",
      "answer": "American Express (AXP) reports a relatively low net write-off rate of 1.3% (principal, interest, and fees) and a 0.7% delinquency rate (30+ days past due) across its total loan portfolio, indicating strong credit discipline. Capital One (COF) highlights nonperforming loans totaling $1.1 billion, with a breakdown showing credit card loans as the largest contributor to nonperforming balances, suggesting higher credit risk in its consumer lending segment. Charles Schwab (SCHW) reports minimal net charge-offs, with a near-zero charge-off rate across its loan categories, particularly in residential real estate and pledged asset lines, indicating a conservative lending approach. Together, these metrics reveal that AXP maintains disciplined underwriting, COF faces more credit stress in its card business, and SCHW adopts a low-risk loan portfolio strategy.",

      "answer": "BK highlights that a material reduction in its credit ratings could increase its funding costs and negatively affect its business and financial condition. C explains that increases in its credit spreads\u2014driven by both market factors and firm-specific perceptions\u2014directly raise its wholesale funding costs and expose it to liquidity risk, especially during periods of quantitative tightening. SCHW notes that rapid increases in short-term interest rates in 2022 and 2023 led to a decline in client sweep cash allocations and forced the company to rely on higher-cost supplemental funding sources, which reduced net income. Collectively, these disclosures show that while all three firms are exposed to rising funding costs, BK is particularly sensitive to credit ratings, C faces broader market-driven liquidity pressures, and SCHW is uniquely affected by client behavior shifts in response to interest rate changes.",

          "chunk_text": "and financial institutions for both institutional and consumer deposits, which represent Citi's most stable and lowest cost source of long-term funding. The competition for deposits has continued to increase in recent years, including as a result of quantitative tightening by central banks and fixed income alternatives for customer funds.\n\nCiti's costs to obtain and access wholesale funding are directly related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and its credit spreads. Changes in Citi's credit spreads are driven by both external market factors and factors specific to Citi, such as negative views by investors of the financial services industry or Citi's financial prospects, and can be highly volatile. For additional information on Citi's primary sources of funding, see 'Managing Global RiskLiquidity Risk' below.\n\nCiti's ability to obtain funding may be impaired and its cost of funding could also increase if other market participants are seeking to access the markets at the same time or to a greater ex tent than expected, or if market appetite for corporate debt securities declines, as is likely to occur in a liquidity stress event or other market crisis. In such circumstances, Citi's ability to sell assets may also be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time or a liquid market does not exist for such assets. Additionally, unexpected changes in client needs due to idiosyncratic events or market conditions could result in greater than ex pected drawdowns from off-balance sheet committed facilities. A sudden drop in market liquidity could also cause a temporary or protracted dislocation of capital markets activity. In addition, clearing organizations, central banks, clients and financial institutions with which Citi interacts may ex ercise the right to require additional collateral during challenging market conditions, which could further impair Citi's liquidity. If Citi fails to effectively manage its liquidity, its businesses, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\n\nLimitations on the payments that Citigroup Inc. receives from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity. As a holding company, Citigroup Inc. relies on interest, dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations. Several of Citi's U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity, regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments, including any local regulatory stress test requirements and inter-affiliate arrangements entered into in connection with Citigroup Inc.'s resolution plan. Citigroup Inc.'s broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses.\n\nA bank holding company is also required by law to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. As a result, the FRB may require Citigroup Inc. to commit resources to its subsidiary banks even if doing so is not otherwise in the interests of Citigroup Inc. or its shareholders or creditors, reducing the amount of funds available to meet its obligations.\n\n## A Ratings Downgrade Could Adversely Impact Citi's Funding and Liquidity.\n\nThe credit rating agencies, such as Fitch Ratings, Moody's Ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings, continuously evaluate Citi and certain of its subsidiaries. Their ratings of Citi and its rated subsidiaries' long-term debt and short-term obligations are based on firm-specific factors, including the financial strength of Citi and such subsidiaries, as well as factors that are not entirely within the control of Citi and its subsidiaries, such as the agencies' proprietary rating methodologies and assumptions, potential impact from negative actions on U.S. sovereign ratings and conditions affecting the financial services industry and markets generally.\n\nA ratings downgrade could result from, among other factors, delays or missteps in Citi's transformation efforts, including risk management and internal controls improvements, public statements by Citi's management or regulators, operational risk charges, control failures, substantial failure to meet cost targets, deterioration in Citi's funding structure or liquidity, declines in profitability, significant increases in risk appetite or material reductions in regulatory capitalization levels.\n\nCiti and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings and outlooks. Ratings downgrades could negatively impact Citi and its rated subsidiaries' ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds as well as increase credit spreads and the costs of those funds. A ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on Citi and its rated subsidiaries' ability to obtain funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity and the impact from derivative triggers, which could require Citi and its rated subsidiaries to meet cash obligations and collateral requirements or permit counterparties to terminate certain contracts. In addition, a ratings downgrade could have a negative impact on other funding sources such as secured financing and other margined transactions for which there may be no explicit triggers.\n\nFurthermore, a credit ratings downgrade could have impacts that may not be currently known to Citi or are not possible to quantify. Some of Citi's counterparties and clients could have ratings limitations on their permissible counterparties, of which Citi may or may not be aware. Certain of Citi's corporate customers and trading counterparties, among other clients, could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit the trading of certain market instruments, and limit or withdraw deposits placed with Citi in response to ratings downgrades. Changes in customer and counterparty behavior could impact not only Citi's funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of certain Citi businesses. For additional information on the potential impact of a reduction in Citi's or Citibank's credit ratings, see 'Managing Global Risk-Liquidity RiskPotential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades' below.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Item 1A.     Risk Factors\n\nWe face a variety of risks that may affect our operations, financial results, or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant, although there may be other risks that could arise, or may prove to be more significant than expected, that may affect our operations or financial results.\n\nFor a discussion of our risk management governance and processes, including operational risk, compliance risk, credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, see Risk Management and Capital Management in Part II - Item 7. For additional information regarding cybersecurity risk, see Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\n## Economic and Market Risks\n\n## Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business.\n\nOur business can be adversely affected by the general environment - economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates, and overall investor engagement, and are outside of our control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources.\n\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, have a significant effect on our operating results. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including changes in its target funds rate and its own balance sheet management, are difficult to predict and can affect our financial results, including net interest revenue and bank deposit account fees, and the market value of our investment securities. These policies can have implications for clients' allocation to cash as we ex perienced in recent years, and higher or lower client cash balances have an impact on our capital requirements, as well as liquidity implications if such changes in allocation are sudden. Investor sentiment and market and trading dynamics can affect client preferences and security selection, and can impact transactions and asset-based revenues.\n\n## A significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income.\n\nWe rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue. Cash awaiting investment may be used to extend margin loans to clients or be swept to our banking subsidiaries and those bank deposits are then used to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities. We also sweep a portion of such cash to the TD Depository Institutions pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, through which we earn bank deposit account fees. A significant reduction in our clients' allocation to cash, a change in the allocation of that cash, or a transfer of cash away from the Company, would likely reduce our income. As a result of the rapid increases in shortterm interest rates in 2022 and 2023, the Company saw a significant decrease in clients' asset allocation to sweep cash and greater client investment in higher-yielding alternatives at Schwab such as fixed income investments and proprietary purchased money market funds. To help facilitate these changes in client cash allocations, the Company utilized higher-cost supplemental funding sources, which negatively impacted the Company's net income.\n\n## Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability.\n\nThe direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our bank deposit account fee revenue. The Company's interest-earning assets include significant holdings of investment securities, which include fixed- and floatingrate debt securities, including substantial holdings of mortgage-backed securities, as well as mortgages. The Company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the Company earns on interest-earning assets decline more than the rates that the Company pays on its funding sources, or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgage-backed securities that the Company holds. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues when we have to waive a portion of our management fees, as we experienced in 2020 and 2021, for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients. A decline in interest rates may also negatively impact our bank deposit account fee revenue, which is earned primarily pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement.\n\nThough the Company may benefit from a rising interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits, or replace deposits with higher-cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets, which can reduce the benefit of higher market interest rates to our net interest revenue, as we ex perienced in recent years. The rapid increases in market interest rates ex perienced in 2022 and 2023 also contributed to increased unrealized losses on our investment",

      "answer": "Bank of America (BAC) highlights that fee income is negatively impacted by market volatility and declining asset values, particularly in wealth management where asset-based fees are tied to AUM. BK emphasizes its heavy dependence on fee-based business for a substantial majority of its revenue, making it especially vulnerable to market downturns and reduced client activity. Capital One (COF), while not directly dependent on market-linked fee income, notes that fee income from credit card operations is influenced by loan growth and credit normalization trends, which affect net revenue margins. Together, these perspectives reveal that BAC is exposed through asset-based fees, BK through transactional and service-based fees, and COF through loan-related fee structures, highlighting different risk profiles tied to their core business models.",

      "answer": "Bank of America incorporates refreshed LTV ratios as a key factor in estimating expected credit losses (ECL) for consumer real estate and commercial loans, using automated valuation models and adjusting for economic outlook. Goldman Sachs reports that the majority of its securities-based loans have LTV ratios below 80%, indicating a conservative collateralization approach in its other collateralized loan portfolio. JPMorgan Chase notes an improvement in average current estimated LTV ratios for its residential real estate loans, attributing this to rising home prices, particularly in high-concentration states like California and Florida. Together, these perspectives show that while all three banks rely on LTV as a core risk metric, they apply it differently across loan types and risk frameworks, reflecting distinct strategies in managing secured credit exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies  consumer  loans  as  nonperforming  at 90  days  past  due  and  reverses interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded.\n\nThe  Corporation  has  identified  the  following three  portfolio  segments  and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nTo  estimate  ECL  for  consumer  loans  secured  by  residential  real  estate,  the Corporation  estimates  the  number  of  loans  that  will  default  over  the  life  of  th e existing  portfolio,  after  factoring  in  estimated  prepayments,  using  quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation's  ECL  include  refreshed  loan-to-value  (L TV)  or,  in  the  case  of  a subordinated lien, refreshed combined L TV (CL TV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography , all of which are further broken down by present collection  status  (whether  the  loan  is  current,  delinquent,  in  default,  or  in bankruptcy).  The  estimates  are  based  on  the  Corporation's  historical  experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses  on  the  unpaid  principal  balance  of  loans  insured  by  th e  Fed eral  Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of the Corporation's HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies  noted  above  and  incorporate  utilization  assumptions  at  time  of default.\n\nFor  loans  that  are  more  than 180  days  past  due,  the  Corporation  bases  the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date  less  costs  to  sell.  Th e  fair  value  of  th e  collateral  securing  th ese  loans  is generally determined using an automated valuation model (A VM) that estimates the value  of  a  property  by  reference  to  market  data  including  sales  of  comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an A VM value is not available, the Corporation  utilizes  publicized  indices  or  if  th ese  meth od s  provid e  less  reliab le valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the  Corporation  believes  that  they  are  representative  of  this  portfolio  in  the aggregate.\n\nFor  loans  that  are  more  than 180  days  past  due,  with  the  exception  of  the Corporation's  fully  insured  portfolio,  th e  outstanding  balance  of  loans  th at  is  in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If th e estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance  to  account  for  the  increase  but  not  to  a  level  above  th e  cumulative charge-off amount.\n\n## Credit Cards and Other Consumer\n\nCredit  cards  are  revolving  lines  of  credit  with out  a  d efined   maturity  d ate.  Th e estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and  timing  of  expected  future  payments  (e.g.,  borrowers  making  full  payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that  it  will  take  for  a  receivable balance  to  pay  off.  Th e  ECL  on  th e  future  payments  incorporates  th e  spending behavior  of  a  b orrower  th rough   time  using  key  b orrower-specific  factors  and   th e economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. F uture draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.\n\nThe ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is  also  determined  using quantitative  methods  supplemented  with  qualitative  analysis.  The  quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, L TV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe  ECL  on  commercial  loans  is  forecasted  using  models  that  estimate  credit losses over the loan's contractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual  terms  to  forecast  future  principal  cash  flows  while  also  considering expected  prepayments.  For  open-ended  commitments  such  as  revolving  lines  of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower's draw and  payment  behavior  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  commitment.  For  loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer  attributes  such  as  L TV  ratio,  net  operating  income  and  debt  service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the  loss  forecasting  model  determines  the  probabilities  of  transition  to  different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower's current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower's industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions  of expected loss are conditioned  to  the  economic  outlook,  and  the  model  considers  key  economic variables  such  as  unemployment  rate,  gross  domestic  product,  corporate  bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns.\n\nIn  addition  to  th e  allowance  for  loan  and   lease  losses,  th e  Corporation  also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves  are  estimated  for  the  unfunded  exposure  using  the  same  models  and methodologies as the funded exposure",

      "answer": "AIG evaluates amortized cost basis in the context of impairments, writing down the basis to fair value if there is intent or likelihood to sell before recovery, resulting in realized losses. COF discloses the amortized cost basis of its investment securities in hedging relationships, showing a significant increase from $236 million in 2022 to $2.2 billion in 2023, with associated basis adjustments of $33 million. JPM provides a detailed breakdown of amortized cost basis across different loan categories, including $160 million for criticized nonaccrual assets and $1,363 million for commercial loans. Together, these disclosures show varying applications of amortized cost basis: AIG focuses on impairment triggers, COF emphasizes hedging-related valuations, and JPM provides granular asset-class transparency, reflecting distinct risk management and accounting strategies.",

      "answer": "AXP defines risk-weighted assets as assets weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve, emphasizing minimal off-balance sheet exposure and linking them directly to the calculation of its Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio. Citi highlights that changes in regulatory treatment or model approvals for risk-weighted assets can negatively impact its capital ratios and ability to return capital, noting that its Basel III models are under ongoing regulatory review, which could result in significant changes to RWA and capital planning. Morgan Stanley discloses that its risk-weighted assets incorporate credit, market, and operational risk, with RWA reflecting both on- and off-balance sheet exposures as well as capital charges tied to these risk categories. Together, these perspectives show that while all three firms are subject to regulatory capital frameworks tied to risk-weighted assets, AXP emphasizes regulatory conformity and limited off-balance sheet complexity, Citi faces direct regulatory constraints and uncertainty in model approvals, and Morgan Stanley takes a broader risk categorization approach that includes operational risk in its RWA calculation.",

For additional information, see the capital return risk factor above and the heightened regulatory scrutiny and ongoing interpretation of regulatory changes risk factor below. Such deficiencies or ineffectiveness could also result in inaccurate financial, regulatory or risk reporting.\n\nMoreover, Citi's Basel III regulatory capital models, including its credit, market and operational risk models, currently remain subject to ongoing regulatory review and approval, which may result in refinements, modifications or enhancements (required or otherwise) to these models. Citi is required to notify and obtain preapproval from both the OCC and FRB prior to implementing certain risk-weighted asset treatments, as well as certain model changes, resulting in a more challenging environment within which Citi must operate in managing its risk-weighted assets. Modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews, as well as any future changes or guidance provided by the U.S. banking regulators regarding the U.S. regulatory capital framework applicable to Citi, including, but not limited to, potential revisions to the U.S. Basel III rules (see the capital return risk factor and 'Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments' above), have resulted, and could continue to result, in significant changes to Citi's risk-weighted assets. These changes can negatively impact Citi's capital ratios and its ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements.\n\n## CREDIT RISKS\n\n## Credit Risk and Concentrations of Risk Can Increase the Potential for Citi to Incur Significant Losses.\n\nCiti has credit ex posures to consumer, corporate and public sector borrowers and other counterparties in the U.S. and various countries and jurisdictions globally, including end-ofperiod consumer loans of $393 billion and end-of-period corporate loans of $301 billion at December 31, 2024. For additional information on Citi's corporate and consumer loan portfolios, see 'Managing Global Risk-Corporate Credit' and '-Consumer Credit' below. For information on Citi's credit and country risk, see also each respective business's results of operations above and 'Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk' below and Notes 15 and 16.\n\nA default by or a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of a borrower or other counterparty, or a decline in the credit quality or value of any underlying collateral, ex poses Citi to credit risk. Additionally, despite Citi's target client strategy, various macroeconomic, geopolitical, market and other factors, among other things, can increase Citi's credit risk and credit costs, particularly for vulnerable sectors, industries or countries (see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties and co-branding and private label credit card risk factors above and the emerging markets risk factor below). For example, a weakening of economic conditions can adversely affect borrowers' ability to repay their obligations, as well as result in Citi being unable to liquidate the collateral it holds or forced to liquidate the collateral at prices that do not cover the full amount owed to Citi.\n\nCiti is also a member of various central clearing counterparties and could incur financial losses as a result of defaults by other clearing members due to the requirements of clearing members to share losses. Additionally, due to the interconnectedness among financial institutions, concerns about the creditworthiness of or defaults by a financial institution could spread to other financial market participants and result in market-wide losses and disruption. For example, the failure of regional banks and other banking stresses in recent years resulted in market volatility across the financial sector.\n\nWhile Citi provides reserves for expected losses for its credit ex posures, as applicable, such reserves are subject to judgments and estimates that could be incorrect or differ from actual future events. For additional information, see the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor above.\n\nConcentrations of risk to clients or counterparties engaged in the same or related industries or doing business in a particular geography, or to a particular product or asset class, especially credit and market risks, can also increase Citi's risk of significant losses. For ex ample, Citi routinely executes a high volume of securities, trading, derivative and foreign ex change transactions with non-U.S. sovereigns and with counterparties in the financial services industry, including banks, insurance companies, investment banks, governments, central banks and other financial institutions. Moreover, Citi has indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions that expose it to concentrations of risk, including credit risk from hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations (see Note 28). A rapid deterioration of a large borrower or other counterparty or within a sector or country in which Citi has large exposures or indemnifications or unexpected market dislocations could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in a certain geography and in related or dependent industries, and such conditions could cause Citi to incur significant losses.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISKS\n\n## Citi's Businesses, Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted if It Does Not Effectively Manage Its Liquidity.\n\nAs a large, global financial institution, adequate liquidity and sources of funding are essential to Citi's businesses. Citi's liquidity, sources of funding and costs of funding can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot control, such as general disruptions in the financial markets; changes in fiscal and monetary policies; regulatory requirements, including changes in regulations; negative investor or counterparty perceptions of Citi's creditworthiness; deposit outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix; unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements; credit ratings; and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources. In addition, Citi competes with other banks",

Citigroup, on the other hand, provides a comprehensive overview of its participation in regulatory stress testing programs like CCAR and DFAST, emphasizing both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of capital planning, with specific mention of Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios (6.0% and 10.0%, respectively) as benchmarks for being 'well capitalized.' Goldman Sachs outlines a firmwide, dynamic, and forward-looking stress testing framework that integrates multiple risk types (credit, market, liquidity, etc.) into capital adequacy assessments, highlighting its internal discipline of daily inventory marking and risk appetite governance. Together, these approaches reveal that while all three firms prioritize capital adequacy, Citigroup leans heavily on regulatory alignment and public reporting, Goldman Sachs emphasizes internal rigor and scenario-based robustness, and Bank of America appears to maintain a more opaque but presumably compliant posture.",

          "chunk_text": "considered 'well capitalized.' Citibank was 'well capitalized' as of December 31, 2024. Furthermore, to be 'well capitalized' under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0% and not be subject to a FRB directive to maintain higher capital levels.\n\n## Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning\n\nCiti is subject to an annual assessment by the FRB as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs: the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST).\n\nFor the largest and most complex firms, such as Citi, CCAR includes a qualitative evaluation of a firm's abilities to determine its capital needs on a forward-looking basis. In conducting the qualitative assessment, the FRB evaluates firms' capital planning practices, focusing on six areas of capital planning: governance, risk management, internal controls, capital policies, incorporating stressful conditions and events, and estimating impact on capital positions. As part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates Citi's capital adequacy, capital adequacy process and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common share repurchases. The FRB assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks.\n\nAll CCAR firms, including Citi, are subject to a rigorous evaluation of their capital planning process. Firms with weak practices may be subject to a deficient supervisory rating, and potentially an enforcement action, for failing to meet supervisory expectations. For additional information regarding CCAR, see 'Risk Factors-Strategic Risks' below.\n\nDFAST is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi's regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the FRB and the general public as to how Citi's regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the FRB. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the FRB.\n\nBoth CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under two supervisory scenarios (baseline and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\nIn addition, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under several scenarios on Citibank's regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as to how Citibank's regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank's capital planning process.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank are required to disclose the results of their company-run stress tests.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE GOLDM AN SACHS GROUP , IN C . AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nProcesses. We maintain various processes that are critical components of our  risk  management  framework,  including  (i)  risk  identification  and assessment,  (ii)  risk  appetite,  limits,  thresholds  and  alerts,  (iii)  control monitoring and testing, and (iv) risk reporting.\n\n- Risk Identification and Assessment. We believe the identification and assessment  of  our  risks  is  a  critical  step  in  providing  our  B oard  and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality  of  our  risks.  We  have  a  comprehensive  data  collection process,  including  firmwide  policies  and  procedures  that  require  all employees  to  report  and  escalate  risk  events.  Our  approach  for  risk identification  and  assessment is  comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile  and  business  environment,  leverages  subject  matter  expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks. We perform risk assessments  periodically  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  that  our  material financial  and  nonfinancial  risks  are  mitigated  through  controls  to  an acceptable tolerance level in accordance with our risk appetite. Our risk assessments  include,  among  other  things,  the  use  of  stress  testing  as well  as  an  assessment  of  our  internal  control  processes  designed  to mitigate such risks.\n\nFirmwide  stress  testing  is  an  important  part  of  our  risk  management process.  It  allows  us  to  quantify  our  exposure  to  tail  risks,  highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into our stress scenarios. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing  process.  See  'Capital  Management  and  Regulatory  Capital  Capital Management' for further information.\n\n96\n\nGoldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nWe  maintain  a  daily  discipline of marking  substantially  all  of  our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems  and  in  net  revenues.  We  do  so  because  we  believe  this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and  that it provides  transparent  and  realistic insight into  our inventory exposures.\n\n- Risk Appetite, Limits, Thresholds and Alerts. We  apply  risk  limits, thresholds  and  alerts  to  control  and  monitor  risk  across  transactions, products,  businesses  and  markets.  The  Board,  directly  or  indirectly through  its  Risk  Committee,  approves  limits,  thresholds  and  alerts included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels.  In  addition,  the  Firmwide  Risk  Appetite  Committee,  through delegated  authority  from  the  Firmwide  Enterprise  Risk  Committee,  is responsible  for  approving  our  risk  limits,  thresholds  and  alerts  policy, subject to the overall limits directly or indirectly approved by the Board, and monitoring these limits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee is responsible for approving and monitoring limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels  that  reflect  our  maximum  risk  appetite.  This  fosters  an  ongoing dialogue  about  risk  among  our  first  and  second  lines  of  defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of riskrelated matters. The Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee also authorizes Risk to set limits and thresholds to support monitoring and oversight at a more  granular  level.  For  example,  Market  Risk  sets  limits  at  certain product  and  desk  levels,  and  Credit  Risk  sets  limits  for  individual counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect  changes  to  our  strategic  business  plan,  as  well  as  changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance. Risks limits are monitored by the respective Risk functions.",

      "answer": "AIG reported 'Other liabilities' of $3,704 million in 2021, primarily reflecting operational or contingent obligations separate from policyholder deposits and long-term debt. AXP disclosed significantly higher 'Other liabilities' of $30,497 million for the same year, indicating a broader or more complex liability structure tied to its credit card and lending operations. MA, in contrast, reported only $12 million in 'Other liabilities' in 2021, consistent with its smaller balance sheet and focus on acquiring and integrating fintech assets rather than carrying large operational liabilities. The stark differences in scale and likely composition highlight divergent business models and liability management priorities across the three firms.",

        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Other liabilities: AIG disclosed $3,704 million in 'Other liabilities' for 2021, a relatively modest figure compared to other liability categories like policyholder deposits.",

        "Hop 3: MA \u2192 Other liabilities: MA disclosed only $12 million in 'Other liabilities' in 2021, consistent with its smaller size and acquisition-focused strategy."

COF discloses $207 million in accrued interest receivable as of December 31, 2021, related to its investment securities portfolio, which includes Agency and non-agency RMBS and CMBS, suggesting a diversified but partially credit-sensitive exposure. SCHW reports $683 million in accrued interest receivable as of December 31, 2021, tied to its AFS securities, primarily backed by U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities considered to be of the highest credit quality.

As of December 31, 2021, the net carrying value of these loans was $15 million.\n\n(c) Does not include allowance for credit losses of $71 million and $79 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, in relation to off-balance-sheet commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans, which is recorded in Other liabilities.\n\nInterest income is not accrued when payment of contractual principal and interest is not expected. Any cash received on impaired loans is generally recorded as a reduction of the current carrying amount of the loan. Accrual of interest income is generally resumed when delinquent contractual principal and interest is repaid or when a portion of the delinquent contractual payments are made and the ongoing required contractual payments have been made for an appropriate period. As of December 31, 2021, $7 million and $226 million of residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans, respectively, were placed on nonaccrual status. As of December 31, 2020, $14 million and $238 million of residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans, respectively, were placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nAccrued interest is presented separately and is included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, accrued interest receivable was $12 million and $126 million associated with residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, accrued interest receivable was $14 million and $129 million associated with residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans, respectively.\n\nA significant majority of commercial mortgages in the portfolio are non-recourse loans and, accordingly, the only guarantees are for specific items that are exceptions to the non-recourse provisions. It is therefore extremely rare for us to have cause to enforce the provisions of a guarantee on a commercial real estate or mortgage loan.\n\nNonperforming loans are generally those loans where payment of contractual principal or interest is more than 90 days past due. Nonperforming loans were not significant for any of the periods presented.\n\n## CREDIT QUALITY OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES\n\nThe following table presents debt service coverage ratios (a)  for commercial mortgages by year of vintage:\n\n",

      "answer": "Citigroup (C) reports no commercial mortgage-backed securities in its investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024, indicating minimal direct exposure to commercial loans in this segment. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shows a significant exposure with $40,342 million in performing commercial loans, though the fair value is slightly below contractual principal at $39,813 million, signaling modest valuation pressure. Morgan Stanley (MS) discloses a total of $7,379 million in commercial loans as of December 31, 2024, with the largest segment in multifamily ($1,928 million) and office ($1,951 million) properties. When synthesized, these disclosures suggest that JPM maintains the largest commercial loan exposure among the three, while C appears to have largely avoided this segment, and MS holds a more moderate, diversified position.",

C discloses $10,066 million in fixed-rate corporate loans, primarily concentrated in commercial and industrial, and mortgage and real estate categories, showing a moderate fixed-rate position. COF reveals $107,018 million in total fixed-rate loans, with a significant portion in consumer and commercial banking, suggesting a high exposure to fixed-rate assets. These differences highlight varying risk appetites and strategies in managing interest rate sensitivity.",

      "question": "How have Bank of America, Capital One, and JPMorgan Chase each responded to rising deposit rates in 2024, and what does this reveal about their respective funding cost management strategies?",
      "answer": "Bank of America experienced an increase in deposit rates paid across its segments, with Consumer Banking at 64 bps in 2024, up from 47 bps in 2023, but considers its deposit base to remain stable and less rate-sensitive than wholesale funding. Capital One notes that rising interest rates are increasing its funding costs, particularly on deposits, and could materially affect profitability if assumptions in its hedging strategies prove incorrect. JPMorgan Chase observed deposit margin compression as rates paid to deposit holders increased more than the FTP benefit, leading to higher funding costs that were partially offset by centralized funds transfer pricing adjustments. Together, these responses show differing approaches to managing deposit rate sensitivity, with BAC emphasizing stability, COF highlighting risk from model inaccuracies, and JPM revealing internal pricing mechanisms to absorb cost increases.",

          "chunk_text": "\nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality  Liquid  Assets  (HQLA)  under  the  final  U.S.  Liquidity  Coverage  R atio  (LCR ) rules.  However,  HQLA  for  purposes  of  calculating  LCR  is  not  reported  at  market value,  but  at  a  lower  value  that  incorporates  regulatory  deductions  and  the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the  amount  of  a  financial  institution's  unencumbered  HQLA  relative  to  the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity  stress,  expressed  as  a  percentage.  Our  average  consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $623 billion and $590 billion for the three months ended December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 113 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.\n\n## Liquidity Stress Analysis\n\nWe  utilize  liquidity  stress  analysis  to  assist  us  in  d etermining  th e  appropriate amounts  of  liquidity  to  maintain  at  the  Parent  and  our  subsidiaries  to  meet contractual  and  contingent  cash  outflows  under  a  range  of  scenarios.  The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events,  including  potential  credit  rating  downgrades  for  the  Parent  and  our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios  are  based  on  our  historical  experience,  experience  of  distressed  and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.\n\nThe types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of  unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments,  liquidity  facilities  and  letters  of  credit;  additional  collateral  th at counterparties  could  call  if  our  credit  ratings  were  downgraded;  collateral  and margin  requirements  arising  from  market  value  changes;  and  potential  liquidity required  to  maintain  businesses  and  finance  customer  activities.  Changes  in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively  impact  potential  contractual  and  contingent  outflows  and  the  related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.\n\nWe  consider  all  sources  of  funds  that  we  could  access  during  each  stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liq uid ity req uirements by legal entity . We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nThe Net Stable F unding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend  to  households  and  businesses  in  both  normal  and  adverse  economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. For the three months ended September 30, 202 4 and December 3 1, 202 4, the average consolidated NSFR was 12 1 percent and 119 percent.\n\n## Diversified Funding Sources\n\nWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities  th rough   a   centra lized ,  glob a lly  coord ina ted   fund ing  a p p roa ch   d iv e rsifie d across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.\n\nThe primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make Parent funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.\n\nWe fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which  were  $1.9 7  trillion  and  $1.92  trillion  at  December  3 1,  202 4  and  2023. Deposits  are  primarily  generated  by  our Consumer  Banking,  GWIM and Global Banking segments.  These  deposits  are  diversified  by  clients,  product  type  and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC.\n\nAt December 3 1, 202 4, 48 percent of our deposits were in Consumer Banking , 15  percent  in GWIM and  29  percent  in Global Banking .  A s  o f  th e   sa m e   p e rio d , approximately 68 percent of consumer and small business deposits and 79 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by clients who have had accounts with us for 1 0 or more years. In addition, at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023, 2 7 percent and 28 percent of our deposits were noninterest bearing and included operating accounts of our consumer and commercial clients. During the three months ended December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023, rates paid on deposits were 64 bps and 4 7 bps in Consumer Banking , 2 75 bps and 28 7 bps in GWIM , and 29 7 bps and 296 bps in Global  Bankin g.  For  information  on  annual  rates  paid  on  consolidated  deposit balances, see Table 8 on page 33.\n\nWe consider a substantial portion of our deposit base to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than  wholesale  funding  sources.  Our  lending  activities  may  also  be  financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans.\n\nOur  trading  activities  in  oth er  regulated  entities  are  primarily  fund ed   on  a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less  sensitive  to  changes  in  our  credit  ratings  than  unsecured  financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in  secured  financing  markets  for  financial  institutions  have  occurred  in  prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in  th e  a v a ila b ility  o f  such   fina ncing.

See ' We face risks resulting from the extensive use of models and data, as well as our evolving use of AI. '\n\n## Fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLike other financial institutions, our business is sensitive to interest rate movements. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the results of our operations and financial condition. For ex ample, higher interest rates may increase our borrowing costs and may require us to increase the interest we pay on funds deposited with us and may reduce the market value of our securities holdings. If interest rates increase or if higher interest rates persist for an extended period of time, our ex penses may increase further. On the other hand, lower interest rates could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the rate of economic growth decreased sharply, causing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, our net income could be adversely affected. While higher interest rates generally enhance our ability to grow our net interest income, there are potential risks associated with operating in a higher interest rate environment. For example, some customers have been and may continue to be less willing or able overall to borrow at higher interest rates. Higher interest rates also have hindered and may continue to hinder the ability of some borrowers to support required loan payments.\n\nAdditionally, interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as customers or commercial clients default on their loans, maintain lower deposit levels or, in the case of credit card accounts, reduce demand for credit or (for existing customers) the level of borrowing or purchase activity. For example, increases in interest rates increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers, which may adversely affect those borrowers' ability to pay as contractually obligated. This could result in additional or fluctuating delinquencies or charge-offs and negatively impact our results of operations. These changes could reduce the overall yield on our interest-earning asset portfolio.\n\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our net interest income and earnings, economic value and capital under various interest rate scenarios of different direction and magnitude. We take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments. For example, the Company employs various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. The Company's hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, the Company may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. We face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed.\n\nChanges in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio. Such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing. See 'Part II-Item 7. MD&amp;A-Market Risk Profile' and ' We face intense competition in all of our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation ' for additional information.\n\n## We may not be able to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to operate our business.\n\nWe may not be able to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to fund our operations, grow our business, pay our outstanding liabilities and meet regulatory expectations. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, including disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets. Additionally, increased charge-offs, rising interest rates, increased refinancing activity and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled or reduce the value of the securities that we hold for liquidity purposes, which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources. We could also experience impairments of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position, including possible constraints on liquidity and capital, as well as higher costs of capital.\n\nIn addition, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include increases in funding costs, downturns in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated, difficulties in credit markets or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, including as a result of unusual effects in the market.\n\n27\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

          "chunk_text": "## Expense allocation\n\nWhere business segments use services prov ided by Corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those serv ices are allocated to the respectiv e business segments. The expense is generally allocated based on the actual cost and use of serv ices prov ided. In contrast, certain costs and inv estments related to Corporate that are not currently utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses, and other items not solely aligned with a particular reportable business segment.\n\n## Funds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing ('FTP') is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. Effectiv e in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB's net interest income that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm's net interest income.\n\nAs a result of higher av erage interest rates, the cost of funds for assets and the FTP benefit earned for liabilities hav e generally increased in the current year, impacting the net interest income of the business segments. During the period ended December 31, 2024, this has resulted in a higher cost of funds for loans and Markets activ ities. In addition, rates paid to deposit holders increased more than the FTP benefit increase during the year, resulting in deposit margin compression.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain rev enues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on page 149 for additional information.\n\n## Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\n\nAs part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock div idends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock div idends to the business segments is aligned with the relev ant regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment's net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock div idends, to arriv e at a business segment's net income applicable to common equity. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97-107 for additional information.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is referred to as equity. The Firm's current equity allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized risk-weighted assets ('RWA') and the global systemically important banks ('GSIB') surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital depletion in a sev ere stress env ironment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line of business and Corporate equity on page 104 for additional information on capital allocation.",

SCHW reported state taxes of $131 million out of a total income tax provision of $1,311 million, or about 10%. V reported state income taxes, net of federal benefit, of $258 million as part of a total income tax provision of $4,173 million, equating to roughly 6%. This indicates that COF bears the highest relative state tax burden, likely due to operating in higher-tax jurisdictions, while V benefits from a more geographically diversified or tax-efficient footprint, and SCHW maintains a moderate but lower exposure to state-level taxation.",

      "question": "How do BAC, C, and JPM each reflect the role of investment banking fees in their revenue composition and strategic positioning, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to capital markets services?",
      "answer": "BAC reports a significant increase in total investment banking fees from $4.7 billion in 2023 to $6.2 billion in 2024, driven by growth in underwriting income ($3.3B in 2024), syndication fees ($1.2B in 2024), and financial advisory services ($1.7B in 2024). This indicates a strong emphasis on expanding its investment banking operations. In contrast, C reports a relatively modest $426 million in investment banking fees for 2024, showing a smaller focus on this segment compared to BAC, with a slight increase from $392 million in 2023. JPM, while not providing specific dollar amounts, emphasizes its strategic role in underwriting, syndication, and advisory services, with a focus on contractual revenue recognition upon transaction execution, suggesting a client-centric, event-driven approach. The differences in scale and disclosure suggest that BAC is aggressively pursuing growth in investment banking, C maintains a more limited presence, and JPM focuses on high-value, relationship-based capital markets services.",

The related contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliv er future serv ices. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliv er serv ices in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future ev ents or underlying asset v alues, and is not recognized until the outcome of those ev ents or v alues are known.\n\n## Investment banking fees\n\nThis rev enue category includes debt and equity underwriting and adv isory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital v ia public offering and priv ate placement of v arious types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as rev enue typically upon execution of the client's transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as rev enue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria.\n\nThe Firm also prov ides adv isory serv ices by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, div estitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Adv isory fees are recognized as rev enue typically upon execution of the client's transaction.\n\nThe following table presents the components of inv estment banking fees.\n\n",

      "question": "How do AXP, COF, and MET each quantify or evaluate the impact of Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) on their credit portfolios, and what does this reveal about their respective risk management approaches in 2022?",
      "answer": "AXP quantifies TDRs by disclosing that in 2019, it had 87 thousand accounts with a total balance of $812 million in troubled debt restructurings, including 78 thousand card member loan accounts with a $602 million balance and 9 thousand card member receivables accounts with a $210 million balance. COF includes TDRs as part of its broader credit portfolio disclosures, with a dedicated table (Table 27) showing TDR activity, indicating structured reporting of this credit risk category. MET evaluates TDRs individually as part of its allowance for credit loss methodology, specifically factoring them into its expected lifetime credit loss calculations for mortgage loans, particularly when concessions are granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The differences in approach suggest that AXP focuses on volume and balance metrics, COF emphasizes structured reporting within broader credit tables, and MET integrates TDRs into forward-looking credit loss estimation frameworks, reflecting distinct risk management philosophies.",

In determining the Company's ACL, management applies significant judgment to estimate expected lifetime  credit  loss,  including:  (i)  pooling  mortgage  loans  that  share  similar  risk  characteristics,  (ii)  considering  expected lifetime credit loss over the contractual term of its mortgage loans adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions, and (iii) considering past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Each of the Company's commercial, agricultural and  residential  mortgage  loan  portfolio  segments  are  evaluated  separately.  The  ACL  is  calculated  for  each  mortgage  loan portfolio  segment  based  on  inputs  unique  to  each  loan  portfolio  segment.  On  a  quarterly  basis,  mortgage  loans  within  a portfolio segment that share similar risk characteristics, such as internal risk ratings or consumer credit scores, are pooled for calculation  of  ACL.  On  an  ongoing  basis,  mortgage  loans  with  dissimilar  risk  characteristics  (i.e.,  loans  with  significant declines  in  credit  quality),  collateral  dependent  mortgage  loans  (i.e.,  when  the  borrower  is  experiencing  financial  difficulty, including when foreclosure is reasonably possible or probable) and reasonably expected troubled debt restructurings ('TDRs') (i.e.,  the  Company  grants  concessions  to  borrower  that  is  experiencing  financial  difficulties)  are  evaluated  individually  for credit  loss.  The ACL  for  loans  evaluated  individually  are  established  using  the  same  methodologies  for  all  three  portfolio segments.  For  example,  the  ACL  for  a  collateral  dependent  loan  is  established  as  the  excess  of  amortized  cost  over  the estimated fair value of the loan's underlying collateral, less selling cost when foreclosure is probable. Accordingly, the change in  the  estimated  fair  value  of  collateral  dependent  loans,  which  are  evaluated  individually  for  credit  loss,  is  recorded  as  a change in the ACL which is recorded on a quarterly basis as a charge or credit to earnings in net investment gains (losses).",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Charles Schwab each characterize the growth and strategic importance of asset management fees in their 2024 financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their respective positioning in the wealth management sector?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reported a significant increase in asset management fees, rising from $12,002 million in 2023 to $13,875 million in 2024, indicating strong growth in this revenue stream and a strategic emphasis on wealth management. Morgan Stanley, while not providing a specific dollar figure, emphasized the structural importance of asset management fees by detailing their revenue recognition policies tied to asset levels and performance-based incentives, signaling a focus on aligning fee structures with client outcomes. Charles Schwab highlighted a 19% year-over-year growth in asset management and administration fees, increasing from $3,492 million in 2023 to $4,146 million in 2024, underscoring its continued expansion in the retail-focused asset management space. Collectively, these figures and disclosures suggest that all three firms are prioritizing asset management as a core revenue driver, albeit with different strategic emphases: BAC on institutional wealth, MS on performance-linked services, and SCHW on retail client acquisition and fee growth.",

LLC ('MS&amp;Co.'),\n- Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC ('MSSB'),\n- Morgan Stanley Europe SE ('MSESE'),\n- Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. International plc ('MSIP'),\n- Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC ('MSCS'),\n- Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ('MSCG'),\n- Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Ltd. ('MSMS'),\n- Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. ('MSBNA') and\n- Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association ('MSPBNA').\n\nFor further information on the Firm's significant regulated U.S. and international subsidiaries, see Note 16.\n\n## 2. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Presentation Changes in 2024\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Firm implemented certain presentation changes which resulted in a decrease to both interest income and interest expense of $4,432  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  and  no  effect  on  net interest  income,  with  the  entire  impact  to  the  Firm  recorded  within  the Institutional Securities segment. These changes further aligned the accounting  treatment  between  the  balance  sheet  and  the  related  interest income  or  ex pense,  primarily  by  offsetting  interest  income  and  ex pense  for certain  prime  brokerage-related  customer  receivables  and  payables  that  are currently accounted for as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The current  and  previous  presentation  of  these  interest  income  and  interest expense amounts are acceptable and the change does not represent a change in  accounting  principle.  These  changes  were  applied  retrospectively  to  the consolidated income statement for 2023 and accordingly, 2023 amounts were adjusted to conform with the current presentation.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when the promised goods or services are delivered to  our  customers in an amount that is based on the consideration the  Firm expects  to  receive  in  ex change  for  those  goods  or  services  when  such amounts are not probable of significant reversal.\n\n## Investment Banking\n\nRevenues from investment banking activities consist of revenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fix ed income securities and loan syndications,  and  advisory  fees,  primarily  for  mergers,  acquisitions  and restructurings.\n\nUnderwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty  or  contingency  related  to  the  amount  to  be  paid.  Underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related underwriting revenues are recorded.\n\nAdvisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated  progress  of  work  and  when  revenues  are  not  probable  of  a significant reversal. Advisory costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items, including those reimbursed.\n\n## Commissions and Fees\n\nCommission and fee revenues generally result from transaction-based arrangements  in  which  the  client  is  charged  a  fee  for  the  ex ecution  of transactions. Such  revenues  primarily  arise  from  transactions  in  equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and options, as well as revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to brokerdealers,  ex changes  and  market  centers  for  ex ecution.  Commission  and  fee revenues  are  recognized  on  trade  date  when  the  performance  obligation  is satisfied.\n\n## Asset Management Revenues\n\nAsset management, distribution and administration fees are generally based on related asset levels, such as the AUM of a customer's account or the net asset value of a fund. These fees are generally recognized when services are performed and the value of the assets is known. Management fees are reduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, provided to the customer.\n\nPerformance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are recorded when the annual performance target is met and the revenues are not probable of a significant reversal.\n\nSales  commissions  paid  by  the  Firm  in  connection  with  the  sale  of  certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred  commission  assets  and  amortized  to  Other  expenses  over  the expected life of the contract. The Firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods.  Other  asset  management  and  distribution  costs  are  recognized  as incurred in the relevant non-interest ex penses line items.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase each characterize their total expense structure in 2023, and what does this reveal about their cost management strategies and operational efficiency in the current financial environment?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reported total expenses of $16.7 billion in 2023, showing a significant increase from $8.6 billion in 2022, primarily driven by higher interest expenses. BlackRock's total expenses remained relatively stable at $11.6 billion in 2023, reflecting disciplined cost control in its asset management operations. JPMorgan Chase recorded total expenses of $17.4 billion in 2023, a rise from $10.9 billion in 2022, largely due to increased interest costs and operational expenditures. The differences in expense trends highlight distinct cost management approaches: BAC faces rising borrowing costs, BLK maintains cost discipline, and JPM experiences higher operational and interest-related expenses.",

      "answer": "Capital One (COF) did not grant any stock options in 2023, with 404 thousand shares outstanding and exercisable at year-end, at a weighted-average exercise price of $75.46, and an aggregate intrinsic value of $22 million. In contrast, Mastercard (MA) granted 0.3 million options during the year at a weighted-average exercise price of $354, with 2.4 million exercisable options at year-end priced at $184 on average, and an aggregate intrinsic value of $581 million. Visa (V) granted 722,695 options in fiscal 2023 at a weighted-average exercise price of $249.56, with 3,862,434 exercisable options at year-end, averaging $165.79 per share, and an aggregate intrinsic value of $422 million. These differences suggest that COF may be shifting away from stock option grants, while MA and V continue to use them more actively, albeit with different pricing strategies, potentially reflecting variations in equity compensation philosophy and long-term incentive design.",

      "answer": "Citigroup (C) provides a detailed geographic breakdown of its trading assets, showing $5.2 billion in the Cayman Islands, $11.9 billion in the United Kingdom, and $16.3 billion in Japan, indicating a significant cross-border exposure. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) discloses $3.885 billion in trading assets as part of its consolidated VIE program assets, suggesting a more structured and internalized approach to trading asset exposure. Morgan Stanley (MS) reports that 11% of its U.S. government and agency securities and other sovereign obligations are classified as trading assets as of December 31, 2024. This mix reveals that C has a more globally diversified trading asset footprint, JPM maintains a controlled exposure through structured vehicles, and MS holds a relatively smaller, more sovereign-focused trading asset position.",

      "answer": "Bank of America reports that a significant portion of its Loans Held for Sale (LHFS) are distressed loans purchased at a deep discount to par, while others are valued near contractual principal. JPMorgan Chase shows a total of $30.0 billion in Loans Held for Sale and at fair value as of December 31, 2023, down from $35.4 billion in 2022, indicating a declining exposure. Morgan Stanley reports $15.255 billion in Loans Held for Sale, with a fair value split between Level 2 ($8.652 billion) and Level 3 ($6.672 billion) valuations. These differences suggest that BAC focuses on distressed assets, JPM maintains a moderate and declining exposure with more standardized assets, and MS holds a smaller but more complex mix of loans with significant Level 3 valuations, reflecting different risk appetites and strategic focuses.",

AXP segments its loans by customer type (Consumer, Small Business, Corporate) and maturity, reporting $133.1 billion in total loans, with a significant portion ($98.1 billion) in the consumer segment. COF organizes its loans by product type (Credit Card, Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking), showing $10.7 billion in total loans, with $7.8 billion in credit card loans and $2.3 billion in consumer banking. The differences in segmentation reflect AIG\u2019s focus on commercial real estate, AXP\u2019s dominance in consumer and small business lending, and COF\u2019s diversified consumer and commercial loan book.",

PayPal discloses a much smaller but growing exposure of $205 million as of December 31, 2021, related to nonconsolidated VIEs, up from $105 million in 2020. Charles Schwab shows a maximum exposure to loss of $1,126 million in 2021, primarily from LIHTC investments at $915 million. These figures indicate that MetLife has the largest and most diversified exposure across investment types, PayPal has a focused but increasing risk in VIEs, and Schwab's exposure is relatively small and concentrated in socially oriented investments like LIHTC and CRA investments.",

Our maximum exposure to loss related to our nonconsolidated VIEs, which represents funded commitments and any future funding commitments, was $205 million and $105 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nIn the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Certain amounts for  prior  years  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  financial  statement  presentation  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  United  States  ('U.S.')  generally  accepted  accounting principles  ('GAAP')  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction and credit losses, income taxes, loss contingencies, revenue recognition, and the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions which we believe to be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  These  estimates  may  change  as  new  events  occur,  and  as  additional  information surrounding the continued impact of the novel coronavirus ('COVID-19') pandemic becomes available. Actual results could differ from these estimates and any such differences may be material to our financial statements.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and are composed of primarily bank deposits, government and agency securities, and commercial paper.\n\n## Investments\n\nShort-term investments include time deposits and available-for-sale debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months but  less  than  one  year  when  purchased  or  maturities  of  one  year  or  less  on  the  reporting  date.  Long-term  investments include time deposits and available-for-sale debt securities with maturities exceeding one year on the reporting date, as well as our strategic  investments.  Our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  are  reported  at  fair  value  using  the  specific  identification  method. Unrealized  gains  and  losses  are  reported  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  (loss),  net  of  related  estimated  tax provisions or benefits.\n\nWe  elect  to  account  for  available-for-sale  debt  securities  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  our subsidiaries, underlying funds receivable and customer accounts, short-term investments, and long-term investments, under the fair value option as further discussed in 'Note 9-Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities.' The changes in fair value related to initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are included in earnings as a component of other income (expense), net.\n\nOur strategic investments consist of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities include investments that do not  have  a  readily  determinable  fair  value,  as  well  as  equity  method  investments.  The  investments  that  do  not  have  readily determinable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the 'Measurement Alternative'). Nonmarketable  equity  securities  also  include  our  investments  where  we  have  the  ability  to  exercise  significant  influence,  but  not control, over the investee and account for these securities using the equity method of accounting. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, and our share of earnings or losses from investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.",

Capital One (COF) actively manages interest rate exposure using derivatives such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and forwards, and also offers customer accommodation derivatives which are offset with counterparty contracts. JPMorgan (JPM) quantifies interest rate sensitivity through fair value option elected liabilities, showing a $46 million gain for a 1 basis point parallel increase in spread, and also measures cross-currency basis risk and FX hedge impacts.

      "answer": "AXP reported total revenues net of interest expense of $42,380 million in 2022, showing strong performance driven by customer contracts and interest income. SCHW highlighted that its net revenues included $235 million attributable to the USAA-IMCO acquisition in 2020, indicating a strategic expansion that directly influenced its revenue base. In contrast, V noted that cybersecurity threats and structural risks from acquisitions could negatively impact revenues, signaling vulnerability to external disruptions despite strong market positioning. Together, these perspectives reveal that while AXP and SCHW experienced direct revenue growth through core operations and acquisitions, V faced potential headwinds from operational and cyber risks that could constrain revenue realization.",

(1)\n\nGoodwill recorded of $472 million, primarily attributable to the additional scale and anticipated synergies from the USAA-IMCO acquisition, was assigned to the Investor Services segment and is deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe Company's consolidated statements of income include total net revenues and net loss attributable to the USAA-IMCO acquisition of $235 million and $51 million, respectively, for the period May 26, 2020 through December 31, 2020.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition, the Company agreed to reimburse USAA for certain contract termination and other fees and severance costs incurred by USAA. These costs totaled $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are included in other expense on the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, the Company incurred various professional fees and other costs related to the USAA-IMCO acquisition, such as advisory, legal, and accounting fees. In total, the Company incurred acquisition costs of $54 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are primarily included in professional services, other expense, and compensation and benefits on the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Pro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited)\n\nThe following table presents unaudited pro forma financial information as if the TD Ameritrade and USAA-IMCO acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma results reflect after-tax adjustments for acquisition costs, amortization and depreciation of acquired intangible and tangible assets, the impact of the amended IDA agreement which reduced the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions to 15 basis points from the 25 basis points paid by TD Ameritrade under its previous IDA agreement, and other immaterial adjustments for the effects of purchase accounting, and do not reflect potential revenue growth or cost savings that may be realized as a result of the acquisitions. Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 excludes after-tax acquisition costs for both Schwab and the acquirees of $156 million. These costs and aftertax acquisition costs of $40 million incurred in 2019 by Schwab and the acquirees are included in pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2019.",

Given the increase in online banking, ecommerce and other online activity, as well as more employees working remotely as a result of the COVID19 pandemic, we continue to see increased cyber and payment fraud activity, as cybercriminals attempt DDoS related attacks, phishing and social engineering scams and other disruptive actions. Overall, such attacks and breaches have resulted, and may continue to result in, fraudulent activity and ultimately, financial losses to Visa's clients.\n\nNumerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, targeted attacks against our employees and trusted partners (i.e., insider threats), phishing and social engineering schemes, particularly on our internet-facing applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data in our systems or  the  systems  of  our  third-party  service  providers.  Because  the  tactics,  techniques  and  procedures  used  to  obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and  sophisticated,  and  may  be  difficult  to  detect  for  periods  of  time,  we  may  not  anticipate  these  acts  or  respond adequately or timely. The security measures and procedures we, our financial institution and merchant clients, other merchants and third-party service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks or system failures. In some cases, the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards, who may not be able to timely patch vulnerabilities or fix security defects, or whose hardware,  software  or  network  services  may  be  subject  to  error,  defect,  delay,  outage  or  lack  appropriate  malware prevention to prevent breaches or data exfiltration incidents. Despite our security measures and programs to protect our systems and data, and prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats.\n\nThese events could significantly disrupt our operations; impact our clients and consumers; damage our reputation and brand; result in litigation or claims, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, and increased regulatory review or scrutiny, investigations, actions, fines or penalties; result in damages or changes to our business practices; decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products; decrease our volume, revenues and future growth prospects; and be costly,  time  consuming  and  difficult  to  remedy.  In  the  event  of  damage  or  disruption  to  our  business  due  to  these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets, and data  through  our  business  continuity  program.  Furthermore,  while  we  maintain  insurance,  our  coverage  may  not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise.\n\n## Structural and Organizational Risks\n\n## We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments, and may face risks and uncertainties as a result.\n\nAs  part  of  our  overall  business  strategy,  we  make  acquisitions  and  strategic  investments,  and  enter  into  joint ventures. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our current and future acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments and they may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\n- disruption  to  our  ongoing  business,  including  diversion  of  resources  and  management's  attention  from  our existing business;\n- greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses;\n- failure to adequately develop our acquired entities or joint ventures;\n- the  data  security,  cybersecurity  and  operational  resilience  posture  of  our  acquired  entities,  joint  ventures  or companies we invest in or partner with, may not be adequate and may be more susceptible to cyber incidents;\n- difficulty, expense or failure of implementing controls, procedures and policies at our acquired entities or joint ventures;\n- challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems and technologies;\n- failure to retain employees, clients or partners of our acquired entities or joint ventures;\n- in  the  case of foreign acquisitions, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages;",

      "answer": "AXP provides a detailed breakdown of changes in net interest income due to volume and rate variances, emphasizing a consistent allocation methodology between U.S. and non-U.S. offices. MS reports average daily balances and interest income across various categories of interest-earning assets, showing that while U.S. assets like loans (2.5%) and trading assets (2.1%) generate higher returns, non-U.S. assets such as securities borrowed (-1.1%) and resale agreements (-0.5%) are less profitable. SCHW quantifies the impact of volume and rate changes, revealing that in 2023, a $6,147 million increase in interest income was driven by rate changes, while volume declines reduced income by $2,263 million, indicating a strong dependence on rising rates. Together, these perspectives show that while all three firms benefit from higher rates, SCHW is particularly leveraged to rate increases, MS shows mixed performance depending on asset class and geography, and AXP emphasizes methodological consistency in measuring these impacts.",

      "question": "How do JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Charles Schwab each manage the composition and yield of their interest-earning assets, and what does this reveal about their contrasting strategies in capital allocation and client-driven asset utilization?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase categorizes its interest-earning assets into broad segments such as brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and other interest-earning assets, emphasizing the impact of interest earned on cash collateral netted against derivative payables. Morgan Stanley breaks down its interest-earning assets by geographic region and asset class, showing a detailed view of average balances, interest income, and average rates, with a focus on trading assets, customer receivables, and investment securities. Charles Schwab provides a year-over-year comparative analysis, showing how changes in average volume and average rate impacted interest-earning assets, with significant increases in interest income driven by higher rates on cash and cash equivalents, receivables from brokerage clients, and bank loans. The synthesis reveals that JPMorgan emphasizes structural aspects of interest-earning assets, Morgan Stanley focuses on geographic and asset-class diversification, and Charles Schwab highlights the sensitivity of interest income to rate changes and volume dynamics in its brokerage and banking segments.",

      "question": "How do AXP, BAC, and JPM each assess the sensitivity of their asset values to interest rate changes, climate-related risks, and technological disruption, and what does this reveal about their respective risk exposure management strategies?",
      "answer": "AXP evaluates the sensitivity of its asset and liability values to interest rate changes using a twelve-month net interest income sensitivity analysis, projecting the impact of instantaneous rate increases or decreases on earnings, with higher rates expected to have a detrimental effect. BAC notes that transition risks related to climate change, such as asset devaluation and increased compliance costs, could negatively impact asset values, especially under a low-carbon economic transition. JPM highlights that both physical and transition risks from climate change could lead to asset value declines, supply chain disruptions, and reputational harm, while also identifying technological disruption as a key risk to traditional banking asset valuations. Synthesizing these perspectives reveals that AXP focuses on interest rate-driven asset sensitivity, BAC emphasizes regulatory and climate-driven asset value risks, and JPM integrates both climate and technological disruption as dual threats to asset valuation and business model sustainability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AXP \u2192 Asset Values: AXP conducts a twelve-month net interest income sensitivity analysis, showing that higher interest rates would have a detrimental impact on net interest income, indicating a strong sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate fluctuations.",
        "Hop 2: BAC \u2192 Asset Values: BAC highlights that the transition to a low-carbon economy could result in asset devaluation, increased compliance costs, and regulatory pressures, all of which negatively impact asset values.",
        "Hop 3: JPM \u2192 Asset Values: JPM identifies both physical and transition climate risks as potential causes of asset value declines, while also noting that technological disruption\u2014especially from fintech and cryptocurrencies\u2014poses a risk to traditional banking asset valuations."

      "question": "How do JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and PayPal differ in their exposure to and management of credit-related financial instruments, and what does this reveal about their respective risk profiles in 2023?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase reports a significant exposure to credit-related derivatives with a fair value of $74 million at the end of 2022, showing a net gain of $226 million in credit derivative receivables during the year. Morgan Stanley, in contrast, reports a credit-related net derivative liability of $990 million in 2023, indicating a shift from a positive position in 2022, suggesting increased exposure or hedging activity. PayPal does not directly hold credit derivatives but manages credit risk through consumer and merchant loan portfolios, with an allowance for credit losses estimated as part of its loan receivables, and by partnering with financial institutions to originate and sell participation interests in receivables. Together, these approaches reflect JPM's emphasis on trading and derivatives, Morgan Stanley's liability management, and PayPal's focus on consumer credit and loan servicing.",

      "answer": "BAC reports $26,003 million in 'Cash and Due From Banks' as of December 31, 2024, showing a decline from $27,892 million in 2023, indicating a moderate reduction in liquidity within this category. C reports significantly smaller amounts, with $65 million in 'Cash and Due From Banks' for its consolidated VIEs in 2024, up from $44 million in 2023, suggesting minimal but growing liquidity allocation in this segment. JPM reports $23,372 million in 'Cash and Due From Banks' for 2024, a 20% decrease from $29,066 million in 2023, reflecting a more pronounced reduction in liquidity positioning compared to BAC. Synthetically, all three banks show a downward trend in this metric year-over-year, though the scale of their exposure varies significantly, with JPM showing the steepest decline and C maintaining a much smaller footprint in this category.",

      "answer": "Bank of America integrates LTV ratios into its expected credit loss (ECL) modeling for both consumer and commercial real estate loans, using refreshed LTV and combined LTV (CLTV) as key attributes alongside borrower credit scores and geography. JPMorgan Chase highlights geographic concentration in its residential real estate portfolio, noting that 70% of its retained loans are in California, New York, Florida, Texas, and Massachusetts, and observes that average LTV ratios have improved due to rising home prices. MetLife applies LTV ratios as a core component of its allowance for credit losses (ACL) for commercial and agricultural mortgage loans, updating them routinely and combining them with internal risk ratings and debt service coverage ratios (DSCR) to assess credit quality and expected losses. These differences show that BAC emphasizes dynamic modeling with LTV as a key variable, JPM focuses on macro trends like home price appreciation affecting LTV, and MET integrates LTV into a broader framework of risk indicators and historical loss experience.",

          "chunk_text": "in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies  consumer  loans  as  nonperforming  at 90  days  past  due  and  reverses interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded.\n\nThe  Corporation  has  identified  the  following three  portfolio  segments  and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nTo  estimate  ECL  for  consumer  loans  secured  by  residential  real  estate,  the Corporation  estimates  the  number  of  loans  that  will  default  over  the  life  of  th e existing  portfolio,  after  factoring  in  estimated  prepayments,  using  quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation's  ECL  include  refreshed  loan-to-value  (L TV)  or,  in  the  case  of  a subordinated lien, refreshed combined L TV (CL TV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography , all of which are further broken down by present collection  status  (whether  the  loan  is  current,  delinquent,  in  default,  or  in bankruptcy).  The  estimates  are  based  on  the  Corporation's  historical  experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses  on  the  unpaid  principal  balance  of  loans  insured  by  th e  Fed eral  Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of the Corporation's HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies  noted  above  and  incorporate  utilization  assumptions  at  time  of default.\n\nFor  loans  that  are  more  than 180  days  past  due,  the  Corporation  bases  the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date  less  costs  to  sell.  Th e  fair  value  of  th e  collateral  securing  th ese  loans  is generally determined using an automated valuation model (A VM) that estimates the value  of  a  property  by  reference  to  market  data  including  sales  of  comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an A VM value is not available, the Corporation  utilizes  publicized  indices  or  if  th ese  meth od s  provid e  less  reliab le valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the  Corporation  believes  that  they  are  representative  of  this  portfolio  in  the aggregate.\n\nFor  loans  that  are  more  than 180  days  past  due,  with  the  exception  of  the Corporation's  fully  insured  portfolio,  th e  outstanding  balance  of  loans  th at  is  in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If th e estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance  to  account  for  the  increase  but  not  to  a  level  above  th e  cumulative charge-off amount.\n\n## Credit Cards and Other Consumer\n\nCredit  cards  are  revolving  lines  of  credit  with out  a  d efined   maturity  d ate.  Th e estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and  timing  of  expected  future  payments  (e.g.,  borrowers  making  full  payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that  it  will  take  for  a  receivable balance  to  pay  off.  Th e  ECL  on  th e  future  payments  incorporates  th e  spending behavior  of  a  b orrower  th rough   time  using  key  b orrower-specific  factors  and   th e economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. F uture draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.\n\nThe ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is  also  determined  using quantitative  methods  supplemented  with  qualitative  analysis.  The  quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, L TV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe  ECL  on  commercial  loans  is  forecasted  using  models  that  estimate  credit losses over the loan's contractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual  terms  to  forecast  future  principal  cash  flows  while  also  considering expected  prepayments.  For  open-ended  commitments  such  as  revolving  lines  of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower's draw and  payment  behavior  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  commitment.  For  loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer  attributes  such  as  L TV  ratio,  net  operating  income  and  debt  service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the  loss  forecasting  model  determines  the  probabilities  of  transition  to  different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower's current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower's industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions  of expected loss are conditioned  to  the  economic  outlook,  and  the  model  considers  key  economic variables  such  as  unemployment  rate,  gross  domestic  product,  corporate  bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns.\n\nIn  addition  to  th e  allowance  for  loan  and   lease  losses,  th e  Corporation  also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves  are  estimated  for  the  unfunded  exposure  using  the  same  models  and methodologies as the funded exposure",

Investments (continued)\n\n## Commercial and Agricultural Mortgage Loan Portfolio Segments\n\nWithin each loan portfolio segment, commercial and agricultural loans are pooled by internal risk rating. Estimated lifetime loss rates, which vary by internal risk rating, are applied to the amortized cost of each loan, ex cluding accrued investment income, on a quarterly basis to develop the ACL. Internal risk ratings are based on an assessment of the loan's credit quality, which can change over time. The estimated lifetime loss rates are based on several loan portfolio segment-specific factors, including (i) the Company's experience with defaults and loss severity, (ii) expected default and loss severity over the forecast period, (iii) current and forecasted economic conditions including growth, inflation, interest rates and unemployment levels, (iv) loan specific characteristics including loan-to-value ('L TV ') ratios, and (v) internal risk ratings. These evaluations are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. The Company uses its several decades of historical default and loss severity experience which capture multiple economic cycles. The Company uses a forecast of economic assumptions for a two-year period for most of its commercial and agricultural mortgage loans, while a one-year period is used for such loans originated in certain markets. After the applicable forecast period, the Company reverts to its historical loss experience using a straight-line basis over two years. For evaluations of commercial mortgage loans, in addition to historical experience, management considers factors that include the impact of a rapid change to the economy, which may not be reflected in the loan portfolio, recent loss and recovery trend experience as compared to historical loss and recovery experience, and loan specific characteristics including debt service coverage ratios ('DSCR'). In estimating expected lifetime credit loss over the term of its commercial mortgage loans, the Company adjusts for expected prepayment and extension experience during the forecast period using historical prepayment and extension experience considering the expected position in the economic cycle and the loan profile (i.e., floating rate, shorter-term fix ed rate and longer-term fix ed rate) and after the forecast period using long-term historical prepayment ex perience. For evaluations of agricultural mortgage loans, in addition to historical ex perience, management considers factors that include increased stress in certain sectors, which may be evidenced by higher delinquency rates,  or  a  change  in  the  number  of  higher  risk  loans.  In  estimating  ex pected  lifetime  credit  loss  over  the  term  of  its  agricultural  mortgage  loans,  the  Company's experience is much less sensitive to the position in the economic cycle and by loan profile; accordingly, historical prepayment experience is used, while extension terms are not prevalent with the Company's agricultural mortgage loans.\n\nCommercial mortgage loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis, which review includes, but is not limited to, an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, L TV  ratios, DSCR and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher L TV ratios  and  lower  DSCR. Agricultural mortgage loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis, which review includes, but is not limited to, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, L TV  ratios and borrower creditworthiness, as well as reviews on a geographic and property-type basis. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans also focuses on higher risk loans.\n\nFor commercial mortgage loans, the primary credit quality indicator is the DSCR, which compares a property's net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. G enerally, the lower the DSCR, the higher the risk of ex periencing a credit loss. The Company also reviews the L TV  ratio of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio. L TV  ratios compare the unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. G enerally, the higher the L TV  ratio, the higher the risk of ex periencing a credit loss. The DSCR and the values utilized in calculating the ratio are updated routinely. In addition, the LTV ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of the Company's ongoing review of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio.\n\nFor agricultural mortgage loans, the  Company's primary credit quality indicator is the  L TV  ratio.  The values utilized in calculating this ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural mortgage loan portfolio and are routinely updated.\n\nAfter commercial and agricultural mortgage loans are approved, the Company makes commitments to lend and, typically, borrowers draw down on some or all of the commitments. The timing of mortgage loan funding is based on the commitment expiration dates. A liability for credit loss for unfunded commercial and agricultural mortgage loan commitments that is not unconditionally cancellable is recognized in earnings and is reported within net investment gains (losses). The liability is based on estimated lifetime loss rates as described above and the amount of the outstanding commitments, which for lines of credit, considers estimated utilization rates. When the commitment is funded or expires, the liability is adjusted accordingly.",

      "question": "How do Morgan Stanley, PayPal, and Charles Schwab each quantify their net exposure in derivative and collateralized instruments, and what does this reveal about their respective risk management strategies and balance sheet utilization?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley reports a total net amount of $28,366 million, with $5,911 million of this amount not fully offset due to lack of enforceable agreements, indicating significant exposure despite offsetting mechanisms. PayPal shows a much smaller net liability of $7 million as of December 31, 2024, down from $39 million in 2023, suggesting effective liability reduction or lower derivative activity. Charles Schwab reports a net liability of $656 million as of December 31, 2024, with $17,794 million in collateral pledged against $19,067 million in gross liabilities, reflecting a strategy that relies heavily on collateral to manage counterparty risk. The differences in scale and collateral usage suggest that Morgan Stanley has a more complex and large-scale derivatives book, PayPal maintains a conservative or limited derivatives exposure, and Charles Schwab uses significant collateralization to manage its derivative liabilities.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America (BAC), Capital One (COF), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) each reflect the credit risk and portfolio dynamics of their credit card segments, and what do their respective allowance for losses, loan modifications, and credit card exposure reveal about their risk management strategies and market positioning in 2023?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reported a $7,346 million allowance for credit card loan losses, representing 55.06% of its total consumer allowance, indicating a significant focus on credit risk in this segment. Capital One disclosed that $699 million of its credit card loans were modified in 2023, with 0.45% of total credit card receivables affected, highlighting a relatively low level of credit stress and active loan modification management. JPMorgan Chase showed a massive $915.658 billion in credit card contractual exposure for 2023, underscoring its dominant position in the credit card market. When synthesized, these figures suggest that while all three banks are heavily involved in credit card lending, BAC is allocating substantial reserves to cover credit card risk, COF is managing credit stress through modifications, and JPM maintains the largest credit card exposure, reflecting differing strategies in risk mitigation and market emphasis.",

      "question": "How do AIG, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley each manage their liquidity resources under stress scenarios, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to liquidity risk in light of AIG's $4.5 billion credit facility, JPM's LCR requirements, and MS's emphasis on liquidity risk management in its balance sheet disclosures?",
      "answer": "AIG manages liquidity stress through a $4.5 billion revolving credit facility available as of December 31, 2023, which is conditioned on maintaining certain financial covenants. JPMorgan Chase manages liquidity under stress through its Contingency Funding Plan and adherence to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which requires maintaining sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. Morgan Stanley emphasizes liquidity risk management within its balance sheet framework, integrating liquidity considerations into its overall financial planning and reporting. The synthesis reveals that AIG relies on committed credit facilities, JPM focuses on regulatory-mandated liquidity buffers, and MS integrates liquidity risk into broader financial disclosures, reflecting distinct risk management philosophies across the firms.",

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) disclosed $3.7 billion and $2.8 billion in accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and noted that it generally does not maintain an allowance for credit losses on these balances, writing them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. PayPal (PYPL) reported accrued interest receivable of $140 million and $101 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were included in other current assets and excluded from gross amortized cost and estimated fair value disclosures.

Capital One, while not directly disclosing detailed metrics about its Wealth Management segment, highlights its stake in broader financial operations through its consolidated financial statements, which implies a strategic alignment in managing capital structures and stakeholder expectations across its business lines, including wealth-related services. Morgan Stanley discloses that its Wealth Management business segment incurs non-trading market risk, particularly interest rate risk, from lending and deposit-taking activities. The firm emphasizes a structured risk management framework, including risk limits and capital planning under stress testing scenarios, to manage exposures in this segment. When synthesized, the three firms demonstrate varying strategic and risk management approaches: BAC focuses on loan structuring and collateralization for high-net-worth clients, COF aligns capital and stakeholder interests across business lines, and MS emphasizes systemic risk controls and market risk mitigation in its wealth operations.",

C notes that interest rate contracts impact net interest income, with a projected near-term reclassification loss of $0.5 billion from cash flow hedges, suggesting some short-term headwinds despite potential long-term benefits from rate changes. GS experienced a decline in net interest income in 2024 compared to 2023, falling from $6.351 billion to $8.056 billion in 2024, but still below the $7.678 billion in 2022, indicating a more complex exposure to interest rate fluctuations and possibly a less favorable asset-liability mix in the current rate environment.

      "question": "How do AXP, COF, and GS each reflect the growth or management of their total deposits in 2024, and what does this reveal about their respective deposit strategies and customer bases?",
      "answer": "AXP reported total deposits of $139.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, with $12.4 billion of those deposits being uninsured, indicating a focus on high-balance customers or a less FDIC-dependent deposit structure. COF showed a significant increase in interest expense on deposits, rising to $11.493 billion in 2024 from $9.489 billion in 2023, suggesting increased reliance on or cost of deposit funding. GS categorized its $433.013 billion in total deposits as of December 2024 across consumer, private bank, brokered CDs, and transaction banking, with consumer deposits alone reaching $181.235 billion, showing a diversified and customer-centric deposit strategy. Together, these figures highlight differing approaches: AXP with a smaller but potentially more specialized deposit base, COF with rising deposit costs, and GS with a large, diversified deposit portfolio.",

      "question": "How do Capital One (COF), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Charles Schwab (SCHW) each position their total capital relative to their overall risk-weighted assets, and what does this reveal about their respective capital adequacy and risk management strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Morgan Stanley reported a total capital of $88,874 million against risk-weighted assets (RWA) of $456,053 million, yielding a total capital ratio of 19.5%. Charles Schwab reported total capital of $40,645 million and $31,816 million across its two segments (CSC and CSB), with corresponding RWAs of $128,230 million and $83,809 million, resulting in strong capital ratios of 31.7% and 38.0%. Capital One, while not explicitly disclosing a total capital figure, shows robust equity and liability positioning with total stockholders' equity of $58,089 million and total liabilities of $31,126 million, suggesting a conservative capital structure. These differences indicate that Schwab maintains the highest capital adequacy relative to risk exposure, while Morgan Stanley aligns with broader industry standards, and Capital One emphasizes balance sheet stability through high equity relative to liabilities.",

        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 Total Capital: Capital One does not directly report a 'total capital' figure but shows strong stockholders' equity of $58,089 million and total liabilities of $31,126 million, indicating a capital structure focused on equity-backed stability.",
        "Hop 2: MS \u2192 Total Capital: Morgan Stanley explicitly reports total capital of $88,874 million against risk-weighted assets of $456,053 million, yielding a total capital ratio of 19.5% as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 3: SCHW \u2192 Total Capital: Charles Schwab reports total capital of $40,645 million and $31,816 million across its two segments (CSC and CSB), with corresponding RWAs of $128,230 million and $83,809 million, resulting in capital ratios of 31.7% and 38.0% respectively."

      "question": "How do Bank of America (BAC), Capital One (COF), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) each compare in terms of their year-over-year change in 'Cash and due from banks' in 2023, and what might this reveal about their respective liquidity strategies?",
      "answer": "Bank of America (BAC) reported a decrease in 'Cash and due from banks' from $30,334 million in 2022 to $27,892 million in 2023, reflecting a reduction of $2,442 million. Capital One (COF) experienced a smaller decline, dropping from $5,193 million in 2022 to $4,903 million in 2023, a decrease of $290 million. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) saw an increase in 'Cash and due from banks' from $27,697 million in 2022 to $29,066 million in 2023, an increase of $1,369 million. This divergence in trends suggests that while BAC and COF may have been reducing liquidity held in non-interest-bearing or low-yielding cash accounts, JPM may have been increasing its liquidity buffer, possibly in response to different risk management or capital deployment strategies.",

      "answer": "Capital One (COF) presents a detailed breakdown of its average balances and interest expense for interest-bearing liabilities across multiple categories, showing how the company managed its liability structure in 2024. Goldman Sachs (GS) reports that its interest-bearing liabilities totaled $1.45 trillion in 2024, with a significant portion coming from interest-bearing deposits ($428.9 billion) and other interest-bearing liabilities ($233.6 billion), reflecting a growing reliance on interest-bearing funding sources. Morgan Stanley (MS) highlights a $25.351 billion increase in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities in 2023 vs. 2022, driven by rate changes, signaling rising funding costs. Together, these disclosures indicate that while all three firms are navigating rising interest-bearing liability costs, they differ in magnitude and composition, with GS showing the largest absolute liability base, MS emphasizing the rate-driven expense growth, and COF focusing on granular liability yield dynamics.",

      "question": "How do American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), and Capital One (COF) each account for direct costs related to their credit card operations, and what does this reveal about their differing cost structures and operational strategies?",
      "answer": "American Express capitalizes direct costs associated with internal-use software and depreciates them over the software's estimated useful life, generally 5 years. Bank of America includes rewards and credit card partner payments in direct costs, with rewards liability estimated based on redemption behavior and partner payments tied to transaction volumes. Capital One capitalizes direct costs incurred during the application development stage of internally developed software projects and depreciates them using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. These differences suggest that AXP focuses on long-term asset management, BAC emphasizes customer and partner incentives as a core cost driver, and COF prioritizes internal development efficiency, revealing distinct strategic approaches to credit card cost structures.",

      "answer": "Bank of America provides detailed credit quality indicators segmented by loan categories, with a focus on residential mortgage performance by vintage year. MetLife emphasizes its commercial mortgage loan portfolio's strength through high debt-service coverage ratios (DSCR) and low loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, indicating a conservative risk profile. Morgan Stanley notes a relatively unchanged allowance for credit losses in 2024, influenced by commercial real estate charge-offs and an economic outlook that assumes continued growth and lower interest rates. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three firms monitor credit quality closely, they differ in portfolio focus, risk tolerance, and macroeconomic assumptions.",

      "question": "How do AIG, COF, and MS each disclose or manage their exposure to off-balance sheet arrangements, and what does this reveal about their differing levels of reliance on and transparency around such financial structures?",
      "answer": "AIG quantifies its off-balance sheet exposure through VIEs, reporting $4,468 million in off-balance sheet assets in 2023, showing a slight decline from 2022. COF includes off-balance sheet arrangements as a dedicated section in its MD&A, signaling strategic importance, though it does not quantify the exposure. MS actively engages in off-balance sheet arrangements via unconsolidated SPEs and lending-related instruments, primarily tied to its Institutional Securities and Investment Management segments, and directs readers to detailed notes for further quantitative disclosure. Together, these disclosures suggest that AIG is reducing off-balance sheet risk, COF is increasing transparency structurally, and MS is deeply embedded in off-balance sheet activity as part of its core institutional operations.",

        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: AIG provides specific dollar amounts for off-balance sheet exposure through VIEs, showing a decrease from $4,685 million in 2022 to $4,468 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: COF \u2192 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: COF includes 'Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements' as a distinct section in its MD&A, indicating its importance in management\u2019s evaluation of financial condition, though no specific figures are disclosed.",
        "Hop 3: MS \u2192 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: MS utilizes off-balance sheet structures via SPEs and lending-related instruments, particularly in its Institutional Securities and Investment Management segments, and refers to detailed notes for further quantitative exposure."

      "answer": "Bank of America emphasizes a comprehensive credit risk management process that includes statistical modeling and behavioral data to manage consumer portfolios, noting an increase in net charge-offs by $1.1 billion in 2024, partly due to higher credit card loan charge-offs. JPMorgan Chase quantifies the financial impact of loan modifications in its commercial and industrial portfolio, reporting $1.9 billion in total modifications with specific impacts such as a 434 basis point reduction in interest rates and term extensions averaging 36 months. Morgan Stanley notes that no loans held for investment were 90 days or more past due and still accruing as of year-end 2024, and indicates that modifications may include interest rate reductions and term extensions in response to borrower financial difficulties. Together, this reveals varying degrees of focus on loan modifications\u2014BAC on consumer credit risk systems, JPM on measurable financial effects in commercial lending, and MS on absence of delinquencies despite modifications.",

Statistical  techniques  in conjunction  with  experiential  judgment  are  used  in  all  aspects  of  portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical experience and  are  a  component  of  our  consumer  credit  risk  management  process.  These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as  well  as  portfolio  management  strategies,  including  authorizations  and  line management,  collection  practices  and  strategies,  and  determination  of  the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.\n\n## Consumer Credit Portfolio\n\nDuring  202 4,  the  U.S.  unemployment  rate  remained  relatively  stable,  and  home prices increased steadily throughout most of 202 4. Net charge-offs increased $1.1 billion to $4.2 billion in 2024 primarily due to higher credit card loan charge-offs.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and lease losses was $8.6 billion, relatively unchanged from 2023. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 72.\n\nFor  more  information  on  our  accounting  policies  regarding  delinquencies, nonperforming  status,  charge-offs  and  loan  modifications  for  the  consumer portfolio, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTable  19  presents  our  outstanding  consumer  loans  and  leases,  consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more.\n\n## Table 19 Consumer Credit Quality\n\n",

      "question": "How do Citigroup (C), Capital One (COF), and Goldman Sachs (GS) each manage or depend on subsidiary dividends, and what does this reveal about their differing reliance on internal capital flows for financial stability and shareholder returns?",
      "answer": "Citigroup receives significant dividends from subsidiaries, with $5,549 million in 2024, contributing to its net income of $12,682 million and indicating a strong internal capital flow mechanism. Goldman Sachs also relies heavily on dividends from subsidiaries and affiliates, reporting $9,021 million in 2024 from nonbank entities, which plays a central role in its total net revenues of $4,875 million and pre-tax earnings of $3,506 million. In contrast, Capital One explicitly cites regulatory and operational risks that could limit its ability to receive such dividends, signaling a more constrained and uncertain reliance on subsidiary capital flows. This comparison reveals that C and GS maintain robust internal capital generation through subsidiaries, while COF faces structural limitations that could impede liquidity and shareholder returns.",

        "Hop 1: Citigroup (C) \u2192 Subsidiary Dividends: C received $5,549 million in dividends from subsidiaries in 2024, which contributed significantly to its total revenues and net income.",
        "Hop 2: Capital One (COF) \u2192 Subsidiary Dividends: COF identified regulatory and operational risks that could limit its ability to receive dividends from subsidiaries, indicating a dependency with notable constraints.",
        "Hop 3: Goldman Sachs (GS) \u2192 Subsidiary Dividends: GS received $9,021 million in dividends from nonbank subsidiaries in 2024, which was a key component of its revenue base and pre-tax earnings."

      "question": "How do Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and PayPal each characterize their exposure to charge-offs in 2024, and what does this reveal about the differing credit risk profiles and provisioning strategies across their loan portfolios?",
      "answer": "Bank of America details specific charge-off policies tied to loan types, including 180-day charge-off timelines for credit card loans and collateral-based write-downs for real estate loans. Morgan Stanley notes charge-offs primarily in the commercial real estate (especially office sector) and links credit risk to macroeconomic variables like GDP growth. PayPal provides quantitative data showing $156 million in total charge-offs during 2024, with a full write-down of merchant loans offset by recoveries. Together, these perspectives reveal that BAC focuses on granular loan-level charge-off triggers, MS ties credit risk to broader economic trends in commercial real estate, and PYPL shows a high turnover of provisions and charge-offs in its merchant finance business.",

Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS  are  not  reported  as  nonperforming.  When  a  nonaccrual  loan  is  deemed uncollectible, it is ch arged off against th e allowance for credit losses. If th e ch arged off  amount is later  recovered,  the  amount  is  reversed  through  the  allowance  for credit losses at the recovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than charge- offs, net chargeoffs are reported as a negative amount.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Corporation's  policies,  consumer  real  estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured longterm standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or F reddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes  90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estatesecured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy , within 60 days of  receipt  of  notification  of  filing,  with   th e  remaining  balance  classified  as nonperforming.\n\nCredit card and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Consumer vehicle  loans  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  status  when  they  become 90 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon  confirmation  of  fraud,  unless  the  borrower's  performance  indicates  that repayment is likely to occur. These loans are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral less expected disposal costs when the loans become 120 days past due, upon repossession of the collateral, within 60 days after receipt of notification of  b a nkruptcy  or  d eath   or  up on  confirmation  of  fraud ,  and   wh en  th e  b orrower's ability to pay cannot be validated. If repossession of the collateral is not expected, the loans are fully charged off.\n\nCommercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection.\n\nBusiness card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\n\nThe  entire  balance  of  a  consumer  loan  or  commercial  loan  or  lease  is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customer's billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable  is  reversed  when  loans  and  leases  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  status. Interest  collections  on  nonaccruing  loans  and  leases  for  which  the  ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored  to  accrual  status  when  all  principal  and  interest  is  current  and  full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nLoans  that  the  Corporation  intends  to  sell  in  th e  foreseeable  future,  including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases.\n\n## Premises and Equipment\n\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nFor the Corporation's financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For assets  that  are  subject  to  collateral  maintenance  provisions,  including  federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses  are  assumed  to  be zero.  For  all  other  assets,  the  Corporation  performs qualitative  analyses,  including  consideration  of  historical  losses  and  current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset.\n\n## Lessee Arrangements\n\nSubstantially  all  of  th e  Corporation's  lessee  arrangements  are  operating  leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the",

      "answer": "Capital One added back $2.4 billion to regulatory capital under the CECL Transition Rule, with 75% phased in by January 1, 2024. Goldman Sachs began phasing in a reduction to regulatory capital due to CECL adoption at 25% per year starting in January 2022, with full implementation expected by January 2025. Charles Schwab, while not directly quantifying CECL's impact, highlights its exposure to regulatory capital changes and notes that new rules could increase costs, constrain capital distributions, and require operational adjustments. Together, these disclosures show that COF is leveraging transitional relief to ease CECL's impact, GS is systematically phasing in reductions, and SCHW is preparing for broader regulatory shifts that could indirectly affect CECL-related capital treatment.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results.\n\nNew legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, money market funds, standards of conduct with clients, conflicts of interest, regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, CRA, changes in required minimum capital and capital structure, and changes in equity market structure, including rules relating to order routing and orderrelated revenues, may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines. In recent years, the SEC has proposed a number of new rules, such as its equity market structure proposals, that would require sweeping changes in industry operations and practices, thereby increasing uncertainty for markets and investors. The U.S. federal banking agencies have recently proposed rules regarding regulatory capital and long-term debt, and compliance with these proposed rules may result in increased costs and reduce our net income. In addition, the FDIC recently proposed amending the brokered deposits framework setting forth its conditions for when broker-dealers, such as CS&amp;Co, that place deposits with depository institutions through brokerage sweep arrangements qualify for the primary purpose exception from the definition of a deposit broker. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury, and operations functions.\n\n## Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition.\n\nCSC, together with its banking, broker-dealer, and FCM/FDM subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits the ability of our broker-dealer subsidiary to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, capital planning, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their stress capital buffer (CSC) or capital conservation buffer (banking subsidiaries) and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.\n\nCSC is subject to the CCAR process, which requires submission of an annual capital plan, and determination of CSC's stress capital buffer. The plan must include a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted. CSC's risk-based capital ratios must ex ceed the regulatory minimum plus the stress capital buffer. The stress capital buffer could make us subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions if we approach our minimum ratios. This could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to stockholders.\n\nIf the average of CSC's total consolidated assets for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches $700 billion, or if the average of cross-jurisdictional activity for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches $75 billion, CSC will become subject to more stringent Category II requirements, including annual stress testing, the advanced approaches framework, and the inability to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital calculations. At December 31, 2024, CSC had approximately $480 billion in total assets and cross-jurisdictional activity of approx imately $27 billion. See also Part II - Item 7 - Current Regulatory and Other Developments for discussion of regulatory proposals that could, among other things, require the Company to include AOCI in its regulatory capital calculations.\n\n## We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings.\n\nThe financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. We are also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.",

      "answer": "Bank of America (BAC) details specific charge-off policies tied to loan categories, such as 180-day charge-off timelines for credit card loans and 120-day timelines for vehicle loans, indicating a structured and policy-driven approach to credit risk. Citigroup (C) reports $10,694 million in total charge-offs in 2024, with $10,201 million in the consumer segment, showing a significant impact on consumer credit and a reactive, replenishment-based strategy reflected in $8,603 million in reserve builds. Capital One (COF) emphasizes the risk charge-offs pose to liquidity and profitability, particularly in a rising interest rate environment, suggesting a forward-looking, risk-mitigation strategy focused on macroeconomic sensitivity. Together, these perspectives reveal BAC's operational discipline, C's consumer credit intensity, and COF's macro-prudential focus in managing credit risk.",

Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS  are  not  reported  as  nonperforming.  When  a  nonaccrual  loan  is  deemed uncollectible, it is ch arged off against th e allowance for credit losses. If th e ch arged off  amount is later  recovered,  the  amount  is  reversed  through  the  allowance  for credit losses at the recovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than charge- offs, net chargeoffs are reported as a negative amount.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Corporation's  policies,  consumer  real  estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured longterm standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or F reddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes  90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estatesecured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy , within 60 days of  receipt  of  notification  of  filing,  with   th e  remaining  balance  classified  as nonperforming.\n\nCredit card and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Consumer vehicle  loans  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  status  when  they  become 90 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon  confirmation  of  fraud,  unless  the  borrower's  performance  indicates  that repayment is likely to occur. These loans are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral less expected disposal costs when the loans become 120 days past due, upon repossession of the collateral, within 60 days after receipt of notification of  b a nkruptcy  or  d eath   or  up on  confirmation  of  fraud ,  and   wh en  th e  b orrower's ability to pay cannot be validated. If repossession of the collateral is not expected, the loans are fully charged off.\n\nCommercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection.\n\nBusiness card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\n\nThe  entire  balance  of  a  consumer  loan  or  commercial  loan  or  lease  is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customer's billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable  is  reversed  when  loans  and  leases  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  status. Interest  collections  on  nonaccruing  loans  and  leases  for  which  the  ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored  to  accrual  status  when  all  principal  and  interest  is  current  and  full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nLoans  that  the  Corporation  intends  to  sell  in  th e  foreseeable  future,  including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases.\n\n## Premises and Equipment\n\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nFor the Corporation's financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For assets  that  are  subject  to  collateral  maintenance  provisions,  including  federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses  are  assumed  to  be zero.  For  all  other  assets,  the  Corporation  performs qualitative  analyses,  including  consideration  of  historical  losses  and  current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset.\n\n## Lessee Arrangements\n\nSubstantially  all  of  th e  Corporation's  lessee  arrangements  are  operating  leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the",

See ' We face risks resulting from the extensive use of models and data, as well as our evolving use of AI. '\n\n## Fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLike other financial institutions, our business is sensitive to interest rate movements. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the results of our operations and financial condition. For ex ample, higher interest rates may increase our borrowing costs and may require us to increase the interest we pay on funds deposited with us and may reduce the market value of our securities holdings. If interest rates increase or if higher interest rates persist for an extended period of time, our ex penses may increase further. On the other hand, lower interest rates could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the rate of economic growth decreased sharply, causing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, our net income could be adversely affected. While higher interest rates generally enhance our ability to grow our net interest income, there are potential risks associated with operating in a higher interest rate environment. For example, some customers have been and may continue to be less willing or able overall to borrow at higher interest rates. Higher interest rates also have hindered and may continue to hinder the ability of some borrowers to support required loan payments.\n\nAdditionally, interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as customers or commercial clients default on their loans, maintain lower deposit levels or, in the case of credit card accounts, reduce demand for credit or (for existing customers) the level of borrowing or purchase activity. For example, increases in interest rates increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers, which may adversely affect those borrowers' ability to pay as contractually obligated. This could result in additional or fluctuating delinquencies or charge-offs and negatively impact our results of operations. These changes could reduce the overall yield on our interest-earning asset portfolio.\n\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our net interest income and earnings, economic value and capital under various interest rate scenarios of different direction and magnitude. We take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments. For example, the Company employs various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. The Company's hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, the Company may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. We face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed.\n\nChanges in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio. Such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing. See 'Part II-Item 7. MD&amp;A-Market Risk Profile' and ' We face intense competition in all of our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation ' for additional information.\n\n## We may not be able to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to operate our business.\n\nWe may not be able to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to fund our operations, grow our business, pay our outstanding liabilities and meet regulatory expectations. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, including disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets. Additionally, increased charge-offs, rising interest rates, increased refinancing activity and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled or reduce the value of the securities that we hold for liquidity purposes, which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources. We could also experience impairments of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position, including possible constraints on liquidity and capital, as well as higher costs of capital.\n\nIn addition, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include increases in funding costs, downturns in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated, difficulties in credit markets or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, including as a result of unusual effects in the market.\n\n27\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "Bank of America explicitly states that a significant increase in default rates would result in a significantly lower fair value for long positions in loans and securities, indicating a direct negative sensitivity to credit risk. JPMorgan Chase discloses the financial effects of loan modifications and defaults, particularly in residential real estate, showing that defaults on modified loans have measurable impacts on their credit portfolio performance. Morgan Stanley incorporates default rates as a key input in discounted cash flow models and valuation techniques for mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate loans, and CDOs, demonstrating a structured approach to modeling credit risk. Together, these approaches reveal varying degrees of quantitative and methodological rigor in how each firm accounts for default risk in asset valuations.",

When evaluating the comparable instruments for use in the valuation of each security, security collateral-specific attributes, including payment priority, credit enhancement levels, type of collateral, delinquency rates and loss severity, are  considered.  In  addition,  for  RMBS  borrowers,  FICO  scores  and  the level of documentation for the loan are considered.\n- Market standard cash flow models may be utilized to model the specific collateral  composition  and  cash  flow  structure  of  each  transaction.  Key inputs to these models are market spreads, forecasted credit losses, and default and prepayment rates for each asset category.\n- Valuation levels of RMBS and CMBS indices are used as an additional data point for benchmarking purposes or to price outright index positions.\n\nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\n- Level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments\n- Level 3-if external prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or not  supported  by  market  liquidity  or  if  the  comparability  assessment involves significant subjectivity related to property type differences, cash flows, performance or other inputs\n\n## Loans and Lending Commitments\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- Fair  value  of  corporate  loans  is  determined  using  recently  executed transactions,  market  price  quotations  (where  observable),  implied  yields from comparable debt, market observable CDS spread levels obtained from independent  external  parties  adjusted  for  any  basis  difference  between cash and derivative instruments, along with proprietary valuation models and default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.\n- Fair value of contingent corporate lending commitments is determined by using  executed  transactions  on  comparable  loans  and  the  anticipated market  price  based  on  pricing  indications  from  syndicate  banks  and customers. The valuation of loans and lending commitments also takes into account fee income that is considered an attribute of the contract.\n- Fair value of mortgage loans is determined using observable prices based on  transactional  data  or  third-party  pricing  for  comparable  instruments, when available.\n- Where  position-specific  external  prices  are  not  observable,  fair  value  is estimated  based  on  benchmarking  to  prices  and  rates  observed  in  the primary market for similar loan\n- or borrower types or based on the present value of expected future cash flows  using  the  Firm's  best  available  estimates  of  the  key  assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved or a methodology that utilizes the capital structure and credit spreads of recent comparable securitization transactions.\n- Fair  value  of  equity  margin  loans  is  determined  by  discounting  future interest cash flows, net of potential losses resulting from large downward price  movements  of  the  underlying  margin  loan  collateral.  The  potential losses  are  modeled  using  the  margin  loan  rate,  which  is  calibrated  from market observable CDS spreads, implied debt yields or volatility metrics of the loan collateral.\n\nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\n- Level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments\n- Level  3-in  instances  where  prices  or  significant  spread  inputs  are unobservable or not supported by market liquidity or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity\n\n## Corporate and Other Debt\n\nCorporate Bonds\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- Fair value is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations,  bond  spreads  and  CDS  spreads  obtained  from  independent external  parties,  such  as  vendors  and  brokers,  adjusted  for  any  basis difference between cash and derivative instruments.\n- The spread data used is for the same maturity as the bond. If the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that references comparable issuers are  used. When  position-specific  external  price  data  is  not observable,  fair  value  is  determined  based  on  either  benchmarking  to comparable instruments or cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single-name  CDS  spreads  and  recovery  rates  or  loss  given  default  as significant inputs.\n\nValuation Hierarchy Classification:\n\n- Level  2-if  value  based  on  observable  market  data  for  comparable instruments\n- Level  3-in  instances  where  prices  or  significant  spread  inputs  are unobservable  or  if  the  comparability  assessment  involves  significant subjectivity\n\n## CDOs\n\nValuation Techniques:\n\n- The  Firm  holds  cash  CDOs  that  typically  reference  a  tranche  of  an underlying synthetic portfolio of single-name  CDS spreads collateralized by  corporate  bonds  ('CLN')  or  cash  portfolio  of  ABS/loans  ('assetbacked CDOs').\n- Credit correlation, a primary input used to determine the fair value of CLNs, is  usually  unobservable  and  derived  using  a  benchmarking  technique. Other  model  inputs,  such  as  credit  spreads,  including  collateral  spreads and interest rates, are typically observable.\n- Asset-backed CDOs are valued based on an evaluation of the market and model input parameters sourced from comparable instruments as indicated by market activity.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n\n## 8. Investments (continued)\n\nThe methodology and significant inputs used to determine the amount of credit loss are as follows:\n\n- The Company calculates the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate is generally the effective interest rate of the security at the time of purchase for fixedrate securities and the spot rate at the date of evaluation of credit loss for floating-rate securities.\n- When  determining  collectability  and  the  period  over  which  value  is  expected  to  recover,  the  Company  applies considerations utilized in its overall credit loss evaluation process which incorporates information regarding the specific security, fundamentals  of the industry and  geographic  area in which  the security issuer operates, and  overall macroeconomic  conditions.  Projected  future  cash  flows  are  estimated  using  assumptions  derived  from  management's single best estimate, the most likely outcome in a range of possible outcomes, after giving consideration to a variety of variables that include, but are not limited to: payment terms of the security; the likelihood that the issuer can service the interest  and  principal  payments;  the  quality  and  amount  of  any  credit  enhancements;  the  security's  position  within  the capital structure of the issuer; possible corporate restructurings or asset sales by the issuer; any private and public sector programs  to  restructure  foreign  government  securities  and  municipals;  and  changes  to  the  rating  of  the  security  or  the issuer by rating agencies.\n- Additional considerations are made when assessing the unique features that apply to certain Structured Products including, but not limited to: the quality of underlying collateral, historical performance of the underlying loan obligors, historical rent and vacancy levels, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors, expected prepayment speeds, current  and  forecasted  loss  severity,  consideration  of  the  payment  terms  of  the  underlying  loans  or  assets  backing  a particular security, changes in the quality of credit enhancement and the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security.\n\nWith respect to securities that have attributes of debt and equity ('perpetual hybrid securities'), consideration is given in the credit loss analysis as to whether there has been any deterioration in the credit of the issuer and the likelihood of recovery in value of the securities that are in a severe unrealized loss position. Consideration is also given as to whether any perpetual hybrid securities with an unrealized loss, regardless of credit rating, have deferred any dividend payments.\n\nAfter the adoption of credit loss guidance on January 1, 2020, in periods subsequent to the recognition of an initial ACL on a security, the Company reassesses credit loss quarterly. Subsequent increases or decreases in the expected cash flow from the security result in corresponding decreases or increases in the ACL which are recognized in earnings and reported within net investment gains (losses); however, the previously recorded ACL is not reduced to an amount below zero. Full or partial writeoffs  are  deducted  from  the ACL  in  the  period  the  security,  or  a  portion  thereof,  is  considered  uncollectible.  Recoveries  of amounts previously written off are recorded to the ACL in the period received. When the Company has the intent-to-sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, any ACL is written off and the amortized cost is written down to estimated fair value through a charge within net investment gains (losses), which becomes the new amortized cost of the security.\n\nMethodologies used during the year ended December 31, 2019 to evaluate the recoverability of a security in an unrealized loss position using OTTI guidance were similar to those used after the adoption of credit loss guidance on January 1, 2020, except: (i) the length of time estimated fair value had been below amortized cost was considered for securities, and (ii) for nonfunctional currency denominated securities, the impact from weakening non-functional currencies on securities that were near maturity was considered in the evaluation. In addition, measurement methodologies were similar, except: (i) a fair value floor was not utilized to limit the credit loss recognized in earnings, (ii) the amortized cost of securities was adjusted for the OTTI to the expected recoverable amount and an ACL was not utilized, (iii) subsequent to a credit loss being recognized, increases in expected cash flows from the security did not result in an immediate increase in valuation recognized in earnings through net investment gains (losses) from reduction of the ACL instead such increases in value were recorded as unrecognized unrealized gains in OCI, and (iv) in periods subsequent to the recognition of OTTI on a security, the Company accounted for the impaired security  as  if  it  had  been  purchased  on  the  measurement  date  of  the  impairment;  accordingly,  the  discount  (or  reduced premium) based on the new cost basis was accreted over the remaining term of the security in a prospective manner based on the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan explains that credit spreads are a key component of the discount rate used in fair value measurements, and an increase in credit spreads generally leads to a decrease in fair value, particularly for mortgage-backed and corporate debt securities. MetLife incorporates credit spreads into the valuation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives by applying spreads to risk-free rates based on collateral arrangements, reflecting counterparty credit risk without requiring additional adjustments due to strong netting and collateral agreements. Morgan Stanley uses credit spread risk sensitivity metrics as part of its Value at Risk (VaR) modeling to assess potential losses in trading portfolios, specifically tracking daily net trading revenues influenced by interest rate and credit spread movements.

The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobserv able input may giv e rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobserv able inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observ able and unobserv able inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobserv able prepayment rates decline); such relationships hav e not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the indiv idual relationships described below, the inv erse relationship would also generally apply.\n\nThe following discussion also prov ides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the v aluation of the Firm's positions.\n\nYield - The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair v alue measurement.\n\nCredit spread - The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return ov er the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair v alue measurement.\n\nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute lev el of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the lev el of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgagebacked securities is driv en by the subordination of the security being v alued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation.\n\nPrepayment speed - The prepayment speed is a measure of the v oluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair v alue measurement of assets v alued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair v alue measurement of assets valued at a discount to par.\n\nPrepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driv en by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the lev el and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality hav e a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.\n\nConditional default rate - The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to hav e lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss sev erity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm's market-making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented.\n\nLoss severity - The loss sev erity (the inv erse concept is the recov ery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relativ e to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss sev erity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss sev erity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair v alue measurement.\n\nThe loss sev erity applied in v aluing a mortgage-backed security depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender's lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.",

Fair Value (continued)\n\nThe credit risk of both the counterparty and the Company is considered in determining the estimated fair value for all OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives, and any potential credit adjustment is based on the net exposure by counterparty after taking into account the effects of netting agreements and collateral arrangements. The Company values its OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives using standard swap curves which may include a spread to the risk-free rate, depending upon specific collateral arrangements. This credit spread is appropriate for those parties that execute trades at pricing levels consistent with similar collateral arrangements. As the Company and its significant derivative counterparties generally execute trades at such pricing levels and hold sufficient collateral, additional credit risk adjustments are not currently required in the valuation process.  The  Company's ability to consistently execute at such pricing levels is, in part, due to the netting agreements and collateral arrangements that are in place with all of its significant derivative counterparties. An evaluation of the requirement to make additional credit risk adjustments is performed by the Company each reporting period.\n\n## Freestanding Derivatives\n\n## Level 2 Valuation Approaches and Key Inputs:\n\nThis  level  includes  all  types  of  derivatives  utilized  by  the  Company  with  the  ex ception  of  ex change-traded  derivatives  included  within  Level  1  and  those derivatives with unobservable inputs as described in Level 3.\n\n## Level 3 Valuation Approaches and Key Inputs:\n\nThese valuation methodologies generally use the same inputs as described in the corresponding sections for Level 2 measurements of derivatives. However, these derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\n\nFreestanding derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. V aluations of non-option-based derivatives utilize present value techniques, whereas valuations of option-based derivatives utilize option pricing models. Key inputs are as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "AXP reports a minimal direct exposure to corporate loans, with only $51 million in corporate loans maturing within one year, representing a negligible portion of its total loan portfolio of $133.081 billion. BLK holds $205 million in loans, including corporate loans, as part of its broader investment portfolio, indicating a more indirect and diversified exposure to corporate credit risk. MS, in contrast, highlights corporate loans as a key component of its credit loss provisions, noting that charge-offs in 2023 were primarily related to corporate and commercial real estate loans, signaling a more significant and active role in corporate lending with associated credit risk. Together, these perspectives reveal AXP as a marginal participant, BLK as a diversified investor, and MS as a core corporate lender with elevated credit risk exposure.",

      "answer": "American Express (AXP) reports that as of December 31, 2023, it maintained regulatory capital ratios in excess of the minimum requirements set by the Federal Reserve and qualified as 'well capitalized.' Capital One (COF) provides a detailed comparison in Table 12, showing its Basel III standardized approach capital ratios against regulatory minimums and well-capitalized standards for both 2023 and 2022. Morgan Stanley (MS) includes its regulatory capital ratios within the Management's Discussion and Analysis section, though without specific figures, the context implies alignment with regulatory expectations. Collectively, these disclosures suggest that all three firms prioritize maintaining capital positions above regulatory floors, though with varying levels of transparency and detail.",

      "answer": "AIG incorporates expected prepayment speeds as a critical input when estimating future cash flows for purchased credit-deteriorated (PCD) RMBS securities, directly influencing the initial allowance for credit losses. JPMorgan Chase uses prepayment speeds as one of several significant unobservable inputs in its internally developed valuation models for level 3 instruments, reflecting the broader judgment required in estimating fair value for less liquid assets. MetLife considers expected prepayment speeds in its discounted cash flow analysis for structured products, factoring them into the assessment of credit losses and recovery value. The synthesis reveals that while all three firms rely on prepayment speeds as a key modeling assumption, AIG focuses on initial credit loss estimation, JPM emphasizes fair value judgment, and MetLife integrates it into ongoing credit loss and recovery assessments.",

MetLife explicitly lists equity volatility as a key unobservable input in the valuation of Level 3 financial instruments, showing its material role in asset/liability management. Morgan Stanley discloses specific equity volatility ranges (7% to 71% in 2024) used in its option pricing models, revealing granular sensitivity to market fluctuations. Together, these approaches show that while all three firms rely on equity volatility as a critical modeling input, they apply it differently \u2014 JPM for credit risk provisioning, MET for fair value estimation, and MS for explicit pricing sensitivity analysis.",

          "chunk_text": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) inv olv ed our especially challenging, subjectiv e, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, prov iding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllow ance for Loan Losses - Portfolio-based component of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios\n\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios was $22.0 billion on total portfoliobased retained loans of $919.3 billion at December 31, 2024. The Firm's allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses ov er the remaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-based component of the Firm's allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan portfolios begins with a quantitativ e calculation of expected credit losses ov er the expected life of the loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are determined based on the weighted av erage of fiv e internally dev eloped macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as deriv ed through forecast macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitativ e calculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjectiv e factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the forecast of macroeconomic v ariables, specifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the Firm's forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the quantitativ e calculation utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjectiv e factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectiv ity, and effort in performing procedures and in ev aluating audit ev idence obtained relating to the credit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort inv olv ed the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter inv olv ed performing procedures and ev aluating audit evidence in connection with forming our ov erall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiv eness of controls relating to the Firm's allowance for loan losses, including controls ov er model v alidation and generation of macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which inv olv ed (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in quantitativ e calculations; (ii) ev aluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv ) evaluating the reasonableness of management's adjustments to the quantitativ e output for the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjectiv e factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic variables.\n\n## Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm carries $1.5 trillion of its assets and $586.2 billion of its liabilities at fair v alue on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $10.9 billion of trading assets and $51.8 billion of liabilities measured at fair v alue on a recurring basis, collectiv ely financial instruments, which are classified as lev el 3 as they contain one or more inputs to v aluation which are unobservable and significant to their fair v alue measurement. The Firm utilized internally dev eloped v aluation models and unobserv able inputs to estimate fair v alue of the lev el 3 financial instruments. The unobserv able inputs used by management to estimate the fair v alue of certain of these financial instruments include interest rate v olatility, equity v olatility, Bermudan switch value and correlation relating to interest rates, interest rate-to-foreign exchange,",

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs quantifies Regulatory VaR as $3,538 million, directly linking it to a significant increase in Market RWAs in 2024. JPMorgan Chase defines Regulatory VaR as 'Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules,' emphasizing its role in market risk measurement and capital adequacy. Morgan Stanley notes that market risk RWA increased due to higher charges on Specific and Incremental risk, which are components influenced by Regulatory VaR. Collectively, this shows that while all three institutions are subject to Regulatory VaR, they differ in how they disclose and contextualize its impact on capital usage and risk exposure.",

        "Hop 1: GS \u2192 Regulatory VaR: GS quantifies Regulatory VaR at $3,538 million and ties it directly to a $7,950 million increase in Market RWAs in 2024, indicating a strong link between VaR and capital consumption.",
        "Hop 2: JPM \u2192 Regulatory VaR: JPM defines Regulatory VaR as a rule-based metric for capital adequacy but does not provide a specific figure, focusing instead on its conceptual role in Pillar 3 disclosures and risk-weighted asset calculations.",
        "Hop 3: MS \u2192 Regulatory VaR: MS attributes a rise in Market RWA to higher Specific and Incremental risk charges, which are influenced by Regulatory VaR, though it does not isolate the VaR figure itself."

          "chunk_text": "\nRegulatory VaR-VaR for regulatory capital requirements\n\nIn  2024,  Credit  risk  RWA  increased  under  both  the  Standardized  and Advanced Approaches. Under the Standardized Approach, the increase was primarily due to higher Securities financing transactions, growth in Corporate lending, as well as an increase in Other credit risk driven by securitizations. These increases  were  partially  offset  by  decreased  ex posure  in  derivatives. Under the Advanced Approach, the increase was primarily due to growth in Corporate lending, increase in Derivatives driven by counterparty credit risk, and higher  Securities  financing  transactions.  These  increases  were  partially offset by decreased exposure in investment securities.\n\nMarket  risk  RWA  increased  in  2024  under  both  the  Standardized  and Advanced Approaches, primarily  driven  by  higher  charges  on  Specific  risk and Incremental risk due to increased exposures.\n\nThe increase in Operational risk RWA in 2024 is related to legal expenses and execution losses.\n\n## G-SIB Capital Surcharge\n\nWe  and  other  U.S.  G -SIBs  are  subject  to  an  additional  risk-based  capital surcharge, the G -SIB capital surcharge, which must be satisfied using CET1 capital and which functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. The surcharge is calculated based on the  G -SIB's size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, and complex ity and\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nsubstitutability ('Method 1') or use of short-term wholesale funding ('Method 2'), whichever is higher.\n\n## Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements\n\nThe Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt ('L TD') and  clean  holding  company  requirements  for  top-tier  BHCs  of  U.S.  G -SIBs ('covered  BHCs'),  including  the  Parent  Company.  These  requirements  are designed  to  ensure  that  covered  BHCs  will  have  enough  loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible  L TD  to  equity  or  otherwise  by  imposing  losses  on  eligible  L TD  or other  forms  of  TLAC  where  an  SPOE  resolution  strategy  is  used  (see 'Business-Supervision and Regulation-Financial  Holding  CompanyResolution  and  Recovery  Planning'  and  'Risk  Factors-Legal,  Regulatory and Compliance Risk').\n\nThese TLAC and eligible L TD requirements include various restrictions, such as requiring eligible  L TD to: be issued by the covered BHC; be unsecured; have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance; and not contain certain embedded features, such as a principal or redemption amount subject to reduction based on the performance of an asset, entity or index, or a similar feature.  In  addition,  the  requirements  provide  permanent  grandfathering  for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible L TD but  for  having  impermissible  acceleration  clauses  or  being  governed  by foreign law.\n\nA covered BHC is also required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of (i) 18% of total RWA or (ii) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the  denominator  of  its  SLR).  Covered  BHCs  must  also  meet  a  minimum external L TD requirement equal to the greater of (i) total RWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the higher of the Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company or (ii) 4.5% of its total leverage exposure.\n\nTLAC buffer  requirements  are  imposed  on  top  of  both  the  risk-based  and leverage  exposure-based  external  TLAC  minimum  requirements.  The  riskbased TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, our Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage exposurebased TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of our total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.",

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs reported $2.3 trillion in assets under management within its asset management segment, emphasizing institutional and high-net-worth clients with a focus on alternative investments. JPMorgan Chase highlighted $2.9 trillion in AUM, with a broader client base including institutional, retail, and corporate clients, and positioned the segment as a key driver of stable fee income. Charles Schwab reported $1.1 trillion in AUM, focusing primarily on retail investors and offering a more cost-efficient, technology-driven platform. When combined, these figures illustrate varying strategic approaches: Goldman leans into alternative assets and elite clientele, JPMorgan emphasizes scale and diversification, and Schwab prioritizes accessibility and digital engagement for retail investors.",

Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries.\n\nOur global proprietary card-issuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, where we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. In addition, we maintain a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support our business activities.\n\nWe aim to satisfy these financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, tenor or investor. We seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in unsecured debt, asset securitizations and deposits, and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility.\n\nOur direct retail deposits have become a larger proportion of our funding over time. We expect the balance of these deposits to continue to grow. Our funding plan is primarily driven by the size and mix of business asset growth, our liquidity position, and choice of funding sources, as well as cash requirements generated by the redemptions of deposits by our customers, the maturities of debt outstanding and related interest payments. In executing our funding plan, we aim to maintain a balanced debt maturity profile with an appropriate mix of short-term and long-term refinancing requirements.\n\n## FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES\n\nWe had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of December 31:\n\n## TABLE 17: SUMMARY OF CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND CONSOLIDATED DEBT\n\n",

Governments, investors or media may pressure us not to repurchase shares of our common stock or other securities, or prohibit us from doing so. Our use of other means to return excess capital to shareholders may be less tax-efficient than repurchases. We maintain a buffer of cash and other liquid assets,  and  may  increase  it.  As  a  result,  we  may  have  less  capital  to  devote  to  other  uses,  such  as  innovation,  acquisitions, development  and  return  of  capital  to  shareholders.  We  may  also  be  restricted  from  repurchasing  shares  or  entering  into  share repurchase programs at times, such as when we are aware of material non-public information.\n\nIf we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock or pay interest on our junior subordinated debentures or trust securities, terms of those instruments may restrict our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the 'Series A preferred stock'), junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures or other securities.\n\n## Our Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\n\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. MetLife, Inc. may also not meet its free cash flow or shareholder cash distribution goals.\n\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required if they determine payments could be adverse to our policyholders or contract holders. Business conditions, rating agency considerations, taxation,  dividend  and  repatriation  rules,  and  monetary  transfer  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rules  may  limit  our  insurance subsidiaries'  dividends  and  other  payments.  We  may  need  to  transfer  capital  among  our  companies  to  comply  with  net  worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\n\n## Investment Risks\n\n## We May Face Defaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events That Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold\n\nIn case of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events, our estimated fair value of our fixed income securities and loan portfolios and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default  rate  of  our  investment  portfolio  may  increase.  These  changes  could  harm  the  issuers  or  guarantors  of  securities  or  the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels if securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fixed income securities may increase our write-downs or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\n\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property type may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the prices we can obtain  when  we  sell  assets,  and  our  results  of  operations  or  financial  condition.  Legislation  or  regulations  that  would  allow  or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans could harm our investment portfolio.\n\nPandemics and other major public health issues (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) have affected and may continue to affect financial markets and our investment portfolio. These have increased and may continue to increase our risk of investment defaults, downgrades and volatility, and lower variable investment income and returns, and may cause or exacerbate any of the investment risks we describe in these risk factors.\n\nMarket volatility affects the value of or return on our investments. It may slow or prevent us from reacting to market events as effectively as we otherwise could. When we sell our investment holdings, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price  lower  than  our  carrying  value,  due  to  reduced  liquidity  during  periods  of  market  volatility  or  disruption,  or  other  reasons. Borrowers may delay or fail to pay principal and interest when due, or may demand loan modifications. Tenants may delay paying rent,  or  fail  to  pay  it,  or  demand  lease  modifications.  We  may  face  moratoriums  on  foreclosures  and  other  enforcement  actions impairments, and loan or lease modifications, due to government action or market conditions. We may also encounter credit spread changes, increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our product fee income. Issuer or guarantor default rates may increase.",

These developments have led and could lead in the future to additional regulatory costs and challenges for us, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- PayPal  (Europe)  operates  in  the  U.K.  within  the  scope  of  its  passport  permissions  (as  they  existed  at  the  end  of  the transition period) pursuant to the Temporary Permissions Regime pending the grant of new U.K. authorizations by the U.K. financial regulators. If we are unable to obtain the required authorizations before the expiry of the longstop dates set by the U.K. regulators under the Temporary Permissions Regime, our European operations could lose their ability to offer services into the U.K. market on a cross-border basis; and\n- our European operations being required to comply with new legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K. that may be in addition to, or inconsistent with, those of the EEA, in each case, leading to increased complexity and costs.\n\n## Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.\n\nAdverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including, but not limited to, tightening in the credit markets, extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets (including the fixed income, credit, currency, equity, and commodity markets), higher unemployment, high consumer debt levels, recessionary or inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, agreements, treaties, tariffs and restrictive actions, the inability of a government to enact a budget in  a  fiscal  year,  government  shutdowns,  government  austerity  programs,  and  other  negative  financial  news  or  macroeconomic developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets and increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position.  Such  conditions  may  also  expose  us  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  or  interest  rates  that  could materially and adversely affect our financial results. See 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Liquidity and Capital Resources' and 'Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' for additional information on our financial risks.\n\n## Real or perceived inaccuracies in our metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\n\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are organically  developed  or  acquired  through  business  combinations. While  the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment.\n\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments  unless  the  retrospective  impact  of  process  improvements  or  enhancements  is  determined  by  management  to  be material.  Further,  as  our  business  develops,  we  may  revise  or  cease  reporting  metrics  if  we  determine  that  such  metrics  are  no longer appropriate measures of our performance. If investors, analysts, or customers do not consider our reported measures to be sufficient or to accurately reflect our business, we may receive negative publicity, our reputation may be harmed, and our business may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance ('ESG') issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\n\nCustomers,  investors,  employees  and  other  stakeholders  are  increasingly  focused  on  ESG  practices,  including  our  efforts  with respect to global talent, cybersecurity, data privacy and protection and climate change. If we do not adapt to and comply with new laws  and  regulations  or  changes  to  legal  or  regulatory  requirements  concerning  ESG  matters,  or  fail  to  meet  rapidly  evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if the Company is perceived to have not responded appropriately to growing concerns with respect to ESG issues, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services, and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.",

      "question": "How do Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Charles Schwab each quantify or disclose their average total assets in 2024, and what does this reveal about their relative balance sheet sizes and business models?",
      "answer": "Goldman Sachs reported average total assets of $1.699 trillion for the quarter ended December 2024, reflecting its focus on institutional and investment banking activities. JPMorgan Chase disclosed average total assets of $631.6 billion for the full year 2024, indicating a significantly larger and more diversified banking operation. Charles Schwab, while mentioning supplemental disclosures related to average balance sheets, does not provide a specific figure for average total assets in the provided excerpt, which aligns with its more asset-light brokerage and wealth management model. This comparison highlights differing asset intensity and operational focus across the three firms.",

        "Hop 1: GS \u2192 Average Total Assets: Goldman Sachs discloses average total assets of $1.699 trillion for December 2024, indicating its scale in institutional finance.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and MetLife each characterize the impact of regulatory capital on their financial positioning, and what does this reveal about the divergent strategic importance of capital adequacy across banking and insurance sectors?",
      "answer": "Bank of America demonstrates strong regulatory capital adequacy under Basel 3 standards, maintaining a 'well capitalized' status under PCA framework in 2024 and 2023. Goldman Sachs experienced an increase in both Standardized and Advanced risk-based capital ratios from 2023 to 2024, driven by capital growth from net earnings and reduced market risk-weighted assets. MetLife emphasizes that regulatory capital levels and composition at the subsidiary level are critical factors influencing its insurer financial strength and credit ratings, indicating a broader dependency on capital adequacy for liquidity access and funding profile. Together, these perspectives highlight how banks focus on regulatory capital as a measure of solvency and operational capacity, while insurers like MetLife rely on it for maintaining creditworthiness and accessing capital markets.",

      "answer": "AIG reports $13,153 million in total liabilities, including $12,644 million categorized under Level 3 and unclassified liabilities, which encompass complex items like derivative liabilities and policyholder contract deposits. BLK discloses $4,854 million in total liabilities, with $2,889 million in Level 2 liabilities tied to securities lending agreements and other operational liabilities. MS discloses $1,375 million in VIE liabilities, with the largest portion coming from investment vehicles and MABS. The comparative analysis shows that AIG has the highest exposure to complex liabilities, particularly through insurance-related obligations and derivatives, while BLK's liabilities are more tied to asset management activities, and MS maintains a smaller but still notable exposure through structured vehicles.",

      "answer": "American Express reported a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 9.8% for the company and 9.6% for its national bank subsidiary in 2024, both above the minimum requirement of 4.0%. JPMorgan Chase showed a lower Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 7.2% for the parent company and 7.9% for its bank subsidiary, still comfortably above regulatory floors. Morgan Stanley, while not directly disclosing its Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, provided a detailed breakdown of its adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure, indicating a focus on the components that determine the ratio. Collectively, these disclosures suggest that all three firms maintain strong capital positions, though with differing degrees of buffer above regulatory minimums, reflecting varied approaches to capital management and risk exposure.",

Morgan Stanley reports $86.4 billion in securities-based lending within its Wealth Management segment, representing the largest single category in its wealth loan portfolio.

( 1)\n\nOur bank subsidiaries' liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity . Bank subsidiaries can also generate  incremental  liquidity  by  pledging  a  range  of  unencumbered  loans  and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window . The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $328 billion and $3 12 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. We have  established  operational  procedures  to  enable  us  to  borrow  against  these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligib ility is d efined  in guid elines from th e FHLBs and  th e Fed eral R eserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the Parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.\n\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. The Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality , liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet  the  obligations  of  that  entity ,  and   transfers  to  th e  Parent  or  to  any  oth er subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.\n\nTable 16 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.",

      "answer": "AIG incorporates loss severity as an unobservable input in the fair value measurement of RMBS and CLO securities, noting that ranges of inputs relate to individual underlying mortgage loans and do not directly correlate to changes in the fair values of specific tranches due to other factors like seniority and attachment points. COF reports a range of 30-80% for loss severity in its Level 3 fair value measurements, using discounted cash flow techniques and vendor pricing to estimate fair value for impaired loans and securitization structures. MS evaluates loss severity as part of collateral-specific attributes when valuing mortgage- and asset-backed securities, particularly for RMBS, and considers it alongside default and recovery rates in discounted cash flow models. The synthesis reveals that AIG emphasizes structural complexity in valuation, COF applies standardized loss severity ranges, and MS integrates loss severity within broader market and model inputs, reflecting differing degrees of specificity and market alignment in their Level 3 valuation practices.",

        "Hop 3: MS \u2192 Loss Severity: MS considers loss severity as a collateral-specific attribute when valuing RMBS, using it in conjunction with default and recovery rates in cash flow models, and benchmarks to market data or comparable instruments when unobservable inputs are used."

JPM notes that changes in housing prices affect the value of residential real estate collateral and influence consumer credit performance, especially in its consumer lending business where household income and collateral values are critical to repayment capacity. Together, these perspectives show that while all three firms recognize housing prices as a systemic credit risk, they differ in how they incorporate this variable\u2014ranging from behavioral spending impacts (AXP) to model-driven credit loss forecasting (Citi) to collateral value sensitivity (JPM).",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS\n\nThis section highlights certain risks that could affect us and our businesses, broadly categorized in accordance with the risk types identified in our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework: 'Strategic &amp; Business, Reputational and Country Risks,' 'Operational and Compliance/Legal Risks' and 'Model, Credit, Market and Funding &amp; Liquidity Risks.' You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in 'Risk Management' under 'MD&amp;A,' which describes our approach to identifying, monitoring and managing the risks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques, may not be fully effective in managing the risks to which we are ex posed. For ex ample, while we are currently conducting a comprehensive assessment and uplift of our risk management capabilities and control environment, the outcome may not meet our or our regulators' expectations.\n\nThe risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\n\n## Strategic &amp; Business, Reputational and Country Risks\n\n## Business and economic conditions are a major driver of our results of operations and difficult conditions in the business and economic environment may materially adversely affect our business.\n\nWe offer a broad array of products and services to consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products. Slow economic growth, economic contraction or shifts in broader consumer and business trends significantly impact customer behaviors, including spending on our cards, the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us, demand for fee-based products and services and levels of customers' deposits with us.\n\nFactors such as consumer spending and confidence, household income and housing prices, unemployment rates, business investment and inventory levels, bankruptcies, geopolitical instability, public policy decisions, government spending, international trade relationships, tariffs, interest rates, tax es, inflation and deflation (including the effects of related governmental responses), energy costs and availability of capital and credit all affect the economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. Additionally, sustained periods of high inflation may, among other things, increase certain of our ex penses and erode consumer purchasing power, confidence and spending. An economic downturn or recession may result in higher unemployment and lower household income, consumer spending, corporate earnings and business investment, which may negatively impact spending on our cards and demand for our products, and increase delinquencies and write-off rates.\n\nSpending by our premium consumer Card Members, for example, is sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels and tends to decline during general economic downturns. Likewise, spending by small business and corporate clients, which comprised approximately 42 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2024, depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation. The consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the economic environment generally can be sudden and severe and can impact customer types and geographies in which we operate in very different ways.\n\n## Our business is subject to the effects of geopolitical conditions, weather, natural disasters and other catastrophic events.\n\nGeopolitical conditions, terrorist attacks, military conflicts, supply chain issues, natural disasters, severe weather, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, information or cybersecurity incidents (including intrusion into or degradation or unavailability of systems or technology by cyberattacks), operational incidents and other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business. Political and social conditions, including geopolitical instability (such as from tensions involving China and the U.S.), fiscal and monetary policies (including developments related to the U.S. federal deficit, debt ceiling, government shutdowns and other budgetary issues), trade wars and tariffs, labor shortages, regional or domestic hostilities, economic sanctions and the prospect or occurrence of more widespread conflicts could also negatively affect our business, operations and partners, consumer and business spending, including travel patterns and business investment, and demand for credit. Pandemics and other health emergencies can have widespread and unpredictable impacts on global society, economic conditions and consumer and business behavior, which may reoccur or occur over an extended duration, such as the macroeconomic and behavioral impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending and many of our partners' businesses relate to travel, our business is sensitive to impacts to travel and tourism, such as health and safety concerns and limitations on travel and mobility. In addition, disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel protection products we offer.\n\nA number of actions are taking place across the globe that impact geopolitical stability. Several countries are considering or have implemented tariffs or other trade barriers or restrictions, as well as other measures affecting cross-border commerce and the flow of information, which could have broad economic consequences, impact global supply chains and negatively affect our business, customers and partners. There are multiple ongoing military conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts) and geopolitical tensions may result in additional conflicts or escalate ex isting conflicts. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we announced that we suspended business operations in Russia and Belarus, and these conflicts have led to economic uncertainty and market disruptions, including the imposition of sanctions and export controls. The broader consequences remain uncertain, but geopolitical conditions may adversely affect macroeconomic conditions and our business in a number of ways, including regional",

The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables, including housing prices, unemployment rate and real GDP, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments.\n\nIn addition, Citi's models determine expected credit losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates, as well as other credit trends.\n\n## Qualitative Component\n\nThe qualitative management adjustment component includes risks that are not fully captured in the quantitative component. These may include but are not limited to portfolio characteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not within historical loss data or the economic forecast, uncertainty in the credit environment and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The primary examples of these are the following:\n\n- Transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law\n- Potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainties, including those related to potential global recession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices and geopolitical tensions\n- Risk associated with consumer payment behavior given the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, Citi's qualitative component of the ACL decreased quarterover-quarter. The decrease was driven by factors such as a release related to reserves for specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions.\n\n## Macroeconomic Variables\n\nAs further discussed below, Citi considers various global macroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the quantitative component of the ACL. Citi's forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL.\n\nThe tables below present Citi's forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic forecast for Citi's ACL at each quarterly reporting period from 4Q23 to 4Q24:\n\n",

The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments hav e no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the ov erhead ratio, on a 'managed' basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also rev iews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net rev enue for the Firm as a whole, and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate, on an FTE basis. Accordingly, rev enue from inv estments that receiv e tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable inv estments and securities. These financial measures\n\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment lev els because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to inv estors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relev ant competitors. Refer to Business Segment &amp; Corporate Results on pages 70-90 for additional information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following summary table prov ides a reconciliation from the Firm's reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.\n\n",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley differ in their quantitative and strategic approaches to managing interest rate sensitivity, particularly in terms of their use of derivatives, sensitivity metrics, and assumptions about deposit behavior?",
      "answer": "Bank of America employs a sensitivity analysis assuming no action in response to rate shocks and highlights nonlinear behaviors in larger shocks, using interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to manage exposure. JPMorgan Chase provides specific sensitivity metrics, such as a $16 million impact from a 10% depreciation of currency on FX exposure related to non-USD LTD hedges. Morgan Stanley emphasizes interest rate and currency sensitivity in its liquidity and capital resources management, with oversight from senior committees, though it does not provide specific quantitative sensitivity figures. Collectively, the firms demonstrate varying levels of granularity and strategic emphasis on interest rate sensitivity, with BAC focusing on behavioral assumptions, JPM on quantitative exposure metrics, and MS on governance and policy oversight.",

      "question": "How do Citigroup (C), Capital One (COF), and Morgan Stanley (MS) each quantify the use of term extensions in loan modifications, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to credit risk management in different lending segments?",
      "answer": "Citigroup reported $28 million in term extensions across residential first mortgages in North America and noted no term extensions in credit card modifications. Capital One disclosed that 97% of consumer banking loan modifications involved term extensions, with an average extension of 4 months for auto loans and 13 months for retail banking. Morgan Stanley applied term extensions across multiple categories, including 50 months for commercial real estate and 120 months for residential real estate when combining term extension with interest rate reduction. These differences suggest that while C applies term extensions selectively in specific segments, COF widely uses them in consumer lending, and MS applies longer extensions, particularly in real estate portfolios.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan highlights delinquency as the primary credit quality indicator for auto and other retained loans, using it to inform chargeoff projections. PayPal discloses that its allowance for consumer loans receivable incorporates delinquency status among other factors in forecasting credit losses, with $341 million allocated to consumer loans as of December 31, 2024. Charles Schwab monitors delinquency alongside other credit quality indicators like FICO scores and loan-to-value ratios, and reported a rise in nonaccrual loans from $15 million to $35 million by year-end 2024. Together, these disclosures show that while all three firms rely on delinquency as a key metric, they apply it differently\u2014JPMorgan in auto loan chargeoff estimation, PayPal in macroeconomic-informed loss modeling, and Schwab in broader credit quality stratification.",

Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Allowance for Consumer Loans Receivable\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the total allowance for loans and interest receivable was $461 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $341 million relates to consumer loans receivable. The allowance for consumer loans receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data and incorporates macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The consumer loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, loan term, delinquency, credit rating, vintage, and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario to reflect the economic conditions applicable to a particular period.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for consumer loans receivable is a critical audit matter are (i) a high degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to certain consumer loss models, and for the revolving credit portfolio, forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales used to estimate expected credit losses; and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for consumer loans receivable, including controls over certain consumer loss models, and for the revolving credit portfolio, forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales used to estimate expected credit losses. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for determining the allowance for consumer loans receivable; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in the estimate; and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of certain methodologies and consumer loss models used by management and (b) for the revolving credit portfolio, the reasonableness of forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California February 4, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2000.",

Amid slower hiring and moderating inflation, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target overnight rate by 100 basis points in the second half of 2024. Management's macroeconomic outlook reflects sustained current benchmark lending rates, with unemployment remaining relatively flat and modest home price appreciation. Though higher mortgage rates are softening demand and reducing borrower affordability, we expect constrained housing supply to keep home prices relatively stable. Furthermore, credit quality metrics in the Company's bank loans portfolio remain very strong and have improved in recent quarters. As a result of these factors, we decreased projected loss rates at December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023.\n\nBank loan-related nonperforming assets consisted of nonaccrual loans of $35 million and $15 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Nonaccrual loans include nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings recorded prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, ' Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures ' on January 1, 2023. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty were not material.\n\n## Credit Quality\n\nIn addition to monitoring delinquency, Schwab monitors the credit quality of First Mortgages and HELOCs by stratifying the portfolios by the following:\n\n- Year of origination;\n- Borrower FICO scores at origination (Origination FICO);\n- Updated borrower FICO scores (Updated FICO);\n- Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at origination (Origination LTV); and\n- Estimated Current LTV ratios (Estimated Current LTV).\n\nBorrowers' FICO scores are provided by an independent third-party credit reporting service and are generally updated quarterly. The Origination LTV and Estimated Current LTV for a HELOC include any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC's origination. The Estimated Current LTV for each loan is updated on a monthly basis by reference to a home price appreciation index.\n\nThe credit quality indicators of the Company's First Mortgages and HELOCs are detailed below:",

      "question": "How do MA, PYPL, and V each describe the impact of cybersecurity threats and litigation risks on transaction volume, and what does this reveal about their exposure to operational and reputational risks in the payments industry?",
      "answer": "MA highlights that litigation settlements, particularly those involving changes to business practices like the no-surcharge rule, could reduce transaction volume by affecting customer relationships. PYPL emphasizes that legal disputes and regulatory actions could lead to increased compliance costs, changes in business practices, and ultimately a decrease in transaction volume. V states that cybersecurity threats and data breaches could disrupt operations, damage reputation, and reduce the use and acceptance of their products, which would lower transaction volume. Collectively, this indicates that all three companies see cybersecurity and legal/regulatory risks as key threats to transaction volume, but with distinct focal points: MA on litigation-driven business limitations, PYPL on regulatory-induced cost and volume impacts, and V on cybersecurity-driven reputational and operational risks.",

Additionally, our compliance with new economic sanctions and related laws with respect to particular jurisdictions or customers could result in a loss of business, which could be significant. Finally, failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties. In particular, a violation and subsequent judgment or settlement against us, or those with whom we may be associated, under economic sanctions and AML, CFT, and anti-corruption  laws  could  subject  us  to  substantial  monetary  penalties,  damages,  and/or  have  a  significant reputational impact. Each instance may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance and/or our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our reputation.\n\n## We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\n\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Potential  changes  in  existing  tax  laws,  including  future  regulatory  guidance,  may  impact  our  effective  income  tax  rate  and  tax payments. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Litigation\n\nLiabilities we may incur or limitations on our business related to any litigation or litigation settlements could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe are a defendant in a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations, including among others, those alleging  violations  of  competition  and  antitrust  law  and  those  involving  intellectual  property  claims.  See  Note  21  (Legal  and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings. In the event we are found liable in any material litigations or proceedings, particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large class-action lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling  the  plaintiff  to  treble  damages  or  under  which  we  were  jointly  and  severally  liable,  we  could  be  subject  to  significant damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\nCertain  limitations  have  been  placed  on  our  business  in  recent  years  because  of  litigation  and  litigation  settlements,  such  as changes to our no-surcharge rule in the United States. Any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could impact our relationships with our customers, including reducing the volume of business that we do with them, which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Business and Operations\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe  global  COVID-19  pandemic  and  measures  taken  in  response  have  adversely  impacted  our  business,  results  of operations and financial condition, and may continue to do so depending on future developments, which are uncertain.\n\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to have negative effects on the global economy. The pandemic has affected business activity, adversely impacting consumers, our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as our workforce. Variants of the virus have emerged, resulting in a resurgence of infections that have affected regions at different times. New variants may emerge with similar results. The extent to which the resurgence and severity of infections has affected, and may in the future affect, regions is  impacted  by  the  ongoing  global  administration  of  vaccines  and  the  availability  of  therapeutic  treatments  in  those  locations. Governments, businesses and consumers continue to react to the changing conditions, tightening or loosening safety measures or voluntarily making personal safety decisions, as applicable, based on the current environment of their location.\n\nThe pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and working in remote or hybrid environments). We continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic and may take further actions as required that are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners and which otherwise meet the responses by",

We are subject to patent disputes and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business as our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims  may  be  brought  directly  or  indirectly  against  our  companies  and/or  against  our  customers  (who  may  be  entitled  to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a result of our acquisitions, particularly in cases where we are introducing new products or services in connection with such acquisitions. We have in the past been forced to litigate such claims, and we believe that additional lawsuits alleging such claims will be filed against us. Intellectual  property  claims,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  are  time-consuming  and  costly  to  defend  and  resolve,  could  require expensive changes in our methods of doing business, or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or make substantial payments to settle claims or to satisfy damages awarded by courts.\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our customers (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules, or policies, that our practices, prices, rules, policies, or customer/user agreements violate applicable law, or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such prices, rules, policies, or agreements. In addition to these types of disputes and regulatory inquiries, our operations are also subject to regulatory and/or legal review and/or challenges that may reflect the increasing global regulatory focus to which the payments industry is subject and, when taken as a whole with other regulatory and legislative action, such  actions  could  result  in  the  imposition  of  costly  new  compliance  burdens  on  our  business  and  customers  and  may  lead  to increased costs and decreased transaction volume and revenue. Further, the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business has grown and expanded in scale and scope, including the number of active accounts and payments transactions on our platform, the range and increasing complexity of the products and services that we offer, and our geographical operations. Any  claims  or  regulatory  actions  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  time  consuming,  result  in  costly litigation, settlement payments, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions), fines, penalties, injunctive relief, or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business.\n\n## INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS\n\nOur agreements with eBay governing our separation from eBay provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations for both eBay and us. Disputes between eBay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future, and an adverse outcome in such matters could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against eBay under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us, and our indemnity obligations to eBay may be significant.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have  commercial  relationships.  Under  these  contracts,  we  generally  indemnify,  hold  harmless,  and  agree  to  reimburse  the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to  our  domain  names,  trademarks,  logos,  and  other  branding  elements  to  the  extent  that  such  marks  are  related  to  the  subject agreement.  We  have  provided  an  indemnity  for  other  types  of  third-party  claims,  which  are  indemnities  related  primarily  to intellectual property rights, confidentiality, willful misconduct, data privacy obligations, and certain breach of contract claims. We have also provided an indemnity to our payments processors in the event of card association fines against the processor arising out of  conduct  by  us  or  our  customers.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification provisions  due  to  our  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  and  circumstances  involved  in  each particular situation.\n\nPayPal  has  participated  in  the  U.S.  Government's  Paycheck  Protection  Program  administered  by  the  U.S.  Small  Business Administration. Loans made under this program are funded by an independent chartered financial institution that we partner with. We receive a fee for providing services in connection with these loans and retain operational risk related to those activities. We have agreed, under certain circumstances, to indemnify the chartered financial institution and its assignee of a portion of these loans in connection with the services provided for loans made under this program.\n\nTo  date,  no  significant  costs  have  been  incurred,  either  individually  or  collectively,  in  connection  with  our  indemnification provisions.",

Given the increase in online banking, ecommerce and other online activity, as well as more employees working remotely as a result of the COVID19 pandemic, we continue to see increased cyber and payment fraud activity, as cybercriminals attempt DDoS related attacks, phishing and social engineering scams and other disruptive actions. Overall, such attacks and breaches have resulted, and may continue to result in, fraudulent activity and ultimately, financial losses to Visa's clients.\n\nNumerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, targeted attacks against our employees and trusted partners (i.e., insider threats), phishing and social engineering schemes, particularly on our internet-facing applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data in our systems or  the  systems  of  our  third-party  service  providers.  Because  the  tactics,  techniques  and  procedures  used  to  obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and  sophisticated,  and  may  be  difficult  to  detect  for  periods  of  time,  we  may  not  anticipate  these  acts  or  respond adequately or timely. The security measures and procedures we, our financial institution and merchant clients, other merchants and third-party service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks or system failures. In some cases, the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards, who may not be able to timely patch vulnerabilities or fix security defects, or whose hardware,  software  or  network  services  may  be  subject  to  error,  defect,  delay,  outage  or  lack  appropriate  malware prevention to prevent breaches or data exfiltration incidents. Despite our security measures and programs to protect our systems and data, and prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats.\n\nThese events could significantly disrupt our operations; impact our clients and consumers; damage our reputation and brand; result in litigation or claims, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, and increased regulatory review or scrutiny, investigations, actions, fines or penalties; result in damages or changes to our business practices; decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products; decrease our volume, revenues and future growth prospects; and be costly,  time  consuming  and  difficult  to  remedy.  In  the  event  of  damage  or  disruption  to  our  business  due  to  these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets, and data  through  our  business  continuity  program.  Furthermore,  while  we  maintain  insurance,  our  coverage  may  not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise.\n\n## Structural and Organizational Risks\n\n## We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments, and may face risks and uncertainties as a result.\n\nAs  part  of  our  overall  business  strategy,  we  make  acquisitions  and  strategic  investments,  and  enter  into  joint ventures. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our current and future acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments and they may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\n- disruption  to  our  ongoing  business,  including  diversion  of  resources  and  management's  attention  from  our existing business;\n- greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses;\n- failure to adequately develop our acquired entities or joint ventures;\n- the  data  security,  cybersecurity  and  operational  resilience  posture  of  our  acquired  entities,  joint  ventures  or companies we invest in or partner with, may not be adequate and may be more susceptible to cyber incidents;\n- difficulty, expense or failure of implementing controls, procedures and policies at our acquired entities or joint ventures;\n- challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems and technologies;\n- failure to retain employees, clients or partners of our acquired entities or joint ventures;\n- in  the  case of foreign acquisitions, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages;",

Capital One (COF), as a Category III institution, is subject to a minimum Total Capital Ratio of 8.0%, and while it does not disclose its exact ratio, its compliance with Basel III rules and use of the CECL transition relief indicates a structured approach to maintaining capital adequacy. Morgan Stanley (MS), using the standardized approach, reported a Total Capital Ratio of 20.3%, significantly above its required ratio of 17.0%. This comparison reveals that while all three firms maintain strong capital positions, MS holds a more conservative capital buffer relative to requirements, whereas AXP is closer to its effective minimum, suggesting a more optimized capital structure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NOTE 12-REGULATORY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n\n## Regulation and Capital Adequacy\n\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Board of G overnors of the Federal Reserve System ('Federal Reserve') and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ('OCC'), respectively (the 'Basel III Capital Rules'). The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('Basel Committee'), along with certain provisions of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ('Dodd-Frank Act') and other capital provisions.\n\nAs a bank holding company ('BHC') with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules.\n\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to prompt corrective action ('PCA') capital regulations.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 ('CET1') capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement, each as described in 'Part I-Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital and Stress Testing Regulation-Stress Capital Buffer Rule.' Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework.\n\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. For information on the recognition of AOCI in regulatory capital under the proposed changes to the Basel III Capital Rules, see 'Part I-Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital and Stress Testing Regulation-Basel III Finalization Proposal.'\n\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') (collectively, 'Federal Banking Agencies') adopted a final rule ('CECL Transition Rule') that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the CECL standard on their regulatory capital (the 'CECL Transition Election'). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the 'day 2' ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform 'scaling factor' of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax  'day 1' CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and the cumulative 'day 2' ongoing impact were being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.\n\nCapital Impact Delayed\n\nPhase In Period\n\n",

      "answer": "Capital One (COF) highlights that integration costs related to the pending Discover transaction could be higher than anticipated, with risks that synergies may not be fully realized or that integration may be more costly or difficult than expected. Morgan Stanley (MS) notes that unsuccessful integration of acquisitions could materially and adversely affect their results of operations, specifically citing the risk of not aligning processes and policies with acquired entities. Charles Schwab (SCHW) discusses the complexity and risk of integrating TD Ameritrade, particularly in transitioning active trader accounts, which could delay synergy realization and increase integration-related costs. Collectively, these perspectives indicate that all three firms face significant exposure to integration cost overruns, though each emphasizes different aspects\u2014COF on regulatory and strategic alignment, MS on operational integration challenges, and SCHW on client transition risks.",

      "answer": "AIG consistently pays $29 million in preferred stock dividends annually, indicating a stable capital structure and predictable preferred shareholder returns. MET pays significantly higher preferred stock dividends, at $198 million in 2023, suggesting a more substantial reliance on preferred equity in its capital structure. SCHW references preferred stock dividends in the context of earnings allocation but does not disclose specific amounts, implying a less prominent role for preferred shares in its capital framework. Together, these differences highlight varied capital composition strategies across the financial services sector, with implications for common shareholder returns and financial flexibility.",

      "answer": "Citigroup reports a total consumer loan portfolio of $393.3 billion, with a significant portion in long-term residential mortgages ($73.9 billion fixed, $65.1 billion floating) and a large credit card segment ($51.9 billion fixed, $132.1 billion floating). JPMorgan Chase's total consumer loans amount to $109.3 billion, with a dominant share in residential real estate ($106.2 billion) and a smaller auto and other loan segment ($3.1 billion). PayPal\u2019s consumer loans are much smaller at $5.4 billion, primarily revolving credit ($5.2 billion), with a notable $138 million in gross charge-offs for revolving loans in 2024. These differences highlight Citigroup\u2019s broad-based consumer lending, JPMorgan\u2019s focus on residential and wholesale lending, and PayPal\u2019s niche in digital consumer credit with higher short-term delinquencies.",

      "question": "How do BAC, COF, and JPM each quantify or contextualize the impact of rising default rates on their financial instruments, lending portfolios, or risk management strategies, and what does this reveal about their sensitivity to credit deterioration in consumer and commercial markets?",
      "answer": "BAC highlights that a significant increase in default rates would result in a significantly lower fair value for long positions in financial instruments like RMBS, CLOs, and CDOs, impacting valuation models that incorporate default assumptions. COF notes that rising default rates are tied to broader economic and social factors, such as consumer confidence and attitudes toward debt, which influence payment patterns and borrowing behavior. JPM provides data on the financial effects of loan modifications and defaults, showing how defaults on restructured residential real estate loans directly affect portfolio performance and recovery outcomes.

Consequently, we may not obtain governmental or regulatory approval for a proposed acquisition on acceptable terms or at all, in which case we would not be able to complete the acquisition despite investing resources in pursuing it.\n\nFor additional risks related to the Transaction, see 'Risks Relating to the Acquisition of Discover' and the section entitled 'Risk Factors' included in our joint proxy statement/prospectus included in the registration statement declared effective by the SEC on January 6, 2025.\n\n## Reputational risk and social factors may impact our results and damage our brand.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our products, services, trustworthiness, business practices, workplace culture, compliance practices or our financial health. All of Capital One's brands are one of our most important assets. Maintaining and enhancing our brand depends largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality products and services. Adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer, commercial, and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating, maintaining and financing accounts. In particular, negative public perceptions regarding our reputation, including negative perceptions regarding our ability to maintain the security of our technology systems and protect customer data, could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that current and potential consumer and commercial customers choose to maintain with us. Negative perceptions may also significantly increase the costs of attracting and retaining customers. In addition, negative perceptions regarding certain industries, partners or clients could also prompt us to cease business activities associated with those entities in order to manage reputational risk.\n\nNegative public opinion or damage to our brand could also result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, cyber-attacks or other security incidents, corporate governance and sales and marketing, and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct. Such conduct could fall short of our customers' and the public's heightened expectations of companies of our size with rigorous privacy, data protection, data security and compliance practices, and could further harm our reputation. In addition, our co-brand and private label credit card partners or other third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us or the financial services industry. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the actual or alleged events discussed above could impact our reputation and business.\n\nIn addition, a variety of economic or social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by account holders and borrowers domestically and internationally. These economic and social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, the public's perception regarding the banking industry and consumer debt, including credit card use, and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy. If consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt, or consumption trends decline or if we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, or we incur significant expenses to do so, our reputation and business and financial results could be materially and negatively affected.\n\nThere has also been an increased focus by investor advocacy groups, investment funds and shareholder activists, among others, on topics related to environmental, social and corporate governance policies, and our policies, practices and disclosure in these areas, including those related to climate change. Reputation risk related to corporate policies and practices on environmental, social and corporate governance topics is increasingly complex. Divergent ideological and social views may create competing stakeholder, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny that may impact our reputation or operations. Furthermore, responding to environmental, social and corporate governance considerations and implementing our related goals and initiatives involve risk and uncertainties, require investments and depend in part on third-party performance or data that is outside of our control. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these goals and initiatives or that any such achievements will have the desired results. Our failure or perceived failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis, if at all, or incorrect perception or distortions of our goals and initiatives could impact our reputation and public perceptions of our business.\n\n## If we are not able to protect our intellectual property rights, or we violate third-party intellectual property rights, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect and enhance our intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, licenses and certain restrictions on disclosure, solicitation and competition. We also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary and confidential information. These measures may not be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction or preventing misappropriation of our proprietary or\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "Capital One (COF) includes NSFR in its glossary of terms, indicating awareness of the metric but provides no operational or strategic context, suggesting a passive acknowledgment of regulatory terminology. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also lists NSFR in its glossary without elaborating on its impact or internal application, reflecting a similar high-level recognition rather than active disclosure. In contrast, Charles Schwab (SCHW) actively discloses its NSFR compliance, noting that it is subject to the final NSFR rule and must maintain available stable funding equal to 100% of required stable funding on a daily basis, with public disclosure of its NSFR on a semi-annual basis. This reveals that while COF and JPM treat NSFR as a standard acronym within regulatory contexts, SCHW engages with it operationally, indicating a more proactive and transparent approach to liquidity risk management under regulatory scrutiny.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley differ in their treatment and disclosure of nonaccrual loans, particularly in terms of financial impact, classification, and trends, and what does this reveal about their credit risk management strategies?",
      "answer": "Bank of America discusses nonaccrual loans as part of its broader credit risk framework, incorporating them into qualitative reserves within the allowance for loan and lease losses, and emphasizes the role of macroeconomic variables like unemployment and real estate prices in forecasting credit losses. JPMorgan Chase includes the principal amounts of nonaccrual loans in its average loan balances for determining average interest rates earned on loans, indicating a focus on the yield impact of these loans. Morgan Stanley provides specific dollar amounts for nonaccrual loans, showing a significant increase from $502 million in 2022 to $877 million in 2023, with a separate disclosure of $86 million in nonaccrual loans without an allowance component. These differences suggest that BAC emphasizes forward-looking risk modeling and economic sensitivity, JPM integrates nonaccruals into performance metrics, and MS highlights the growing size and segmentation of nonperforming assets.",

JPMorganChase could become subject to similar regulatory or governmental resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorganChase incurring higher operational and compliance costs, including dev oting substantial resources to the required remediation or needing to comply with other restrictions.\n\nIn connection with resolv ing specific regulatory inv estigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators hav e required JPMorganChase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activ ities that gav e rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\n\n- greater exposure in litigation\n- damage to JPMorganChase's reputation\n- disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or\n- other direct and indirect adv erse effects.\n\nFurthermore, gov ernment officials in the U.S. and other countries hav e demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and hav e required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolv ing regulatory inv estigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can hav e significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:\n\n- loss of clients, customers and business\n- restrictions on offering certain products or serv ices, and\n- losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.\n\nJPMorganChase expects that:\n\n- it and other financial serv ices firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and gov ernmental inv estigations and enforcement actions\n- governmental authorities will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed v iolations of law with formal and punitiv e enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolv ing these matters through informal superv isory actions, and\n- governmental authorities will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorganChase to the extent that it has prev iously been subject to other gov ernmental inv estigations or enforcement actions.\n\nIf JPMorganChase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental inv estigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators, it could be required to, among other things:\n\n- enter into further resolutions of inv estigations or enforcement actions\n- pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments, or\n- accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.\n\nIn these circumstances, JPMorganChase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civ il litigation with respect to the conduct that gav e rise to an inv estigation or enforcement action.

      "question": "How do AIG, BAC, and SCHW each quantify and manage their Allowance for Credit Losses in relation to their respective loan portfolios, and what does this reveal about their risk exposure and provisioning strategies in 2024?",
      "answer": "AIG reported an Allowance for Credit Losses of $138 million as of December 31, 2023, which represented 4% of its total loans. This indicates a relatively conservative provisioning approach, especially given that 1% of its loans were over 90 days delinquent or in foreclosure. BAC, on the other hand, had a significantly higher Allowance for Credit Losses of $14,336 million as of December 31, 2024, with a net charge-off rate of 0.57% of average loans, showing a more aggressive provisioning strategy aligned with its larger and more diverse loan book. SCHW maintained a much smaller Allowance for Credit Losses of $21 million as of December 31, 2024, against a total loan portfolio of $45,236 million, suggesting a more optimistic or lower-risk credit profile, particularly in its residential real estate and pledged asset lines. Collectively, these figures highlight differing risk appetites and provisioning philosophies across the three firms, with BAC reserving more heavily for potential losses, AIG maintaining moderate reserves, and SCHW showing the lowest provisioning intensity.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley differ in their quantitative exposure to foreign exchange risk in 2023, and what does this reveal about their respective risk management strategies?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reported a foreign exchange exposure of $29 million as of December 31, 2023, indicating a relatively low exposure compared to other risk categories like interest rate and credit. JPMorgan Chase incorporates foreign exchange adjustments in the accounting for its held-for-investment loans, reflecting a more integrated approach to managing FX risk within its broader credit portfolio. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, reported a significantly higher foreign exchange-related impact of $1,054 million in 2023, placing it second only to equity-related gains. This suggests that Morgan Stanley has a more pronounced exposure to FX markets, likely due to its trading and investment banking activities. Collectively, these figures indicate that while all three institutions manage FX risk, they do so with different intensities and strategies\u2014BAC with a conservative stance, JPM through integration into loan accounting, and MS with a more active exposure tied to its capital markets operations.",

      "answer": "American Express (AXP) generates significant revenue from its credit card business, primarily through discount revenue earned from merchants, interest income from outstanding balances, and annual card fees. The company emphasizes its integrated global payments model, where credit cards are a core product within its broader portfolio. Bank of America (BAC) reports $102.2 billion in credit card outstandings, with $2.4 billion in past-due balances (30+ days), indicating a substantial but managed exposure to consumer credit risk. MetLife (MET), while not directly issuing credit cards, holds $1.122 billion in credit card-related asset-backed securities (ABS) within its investment portfolio, representing 5.5% of total ABS holdings and showing a more indirect, investment-oriented exposure. The contrast in direct lending (BAC), payment facilitation (AXP), and investment exposure (MET) highlights distinct roles and risk profiles across the credit card ecosystem.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&amp;A)\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## BUSINESS INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are a globally integrated payments company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), Commercial Services (CS), International Card Services (ICS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate &amp; Other.\n\nOur range of products and services includes:\n\n- Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products\n- Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, fraud prevention, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants\n- Network services\n- Travel and lifestyle services\n- Expense management products and services\n- Other services, such as the design and operation of customer loyalty programs\n\nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services:\n\n- Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, primarily represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for card-not-present transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States;\n- Interest income, principally represents interest earned on outstanding loan balances;\n- Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account;\n- Service fees and other revenue, primarily represent service fees earned from merchants and other customers, foreign currency-related fees charged to Card Members, Card Member delinquency fees, travel commissions and fees, and income (losses) from our investments in which we have significant influence; and\n- Processed revenue, primarily represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners.\n\nRefer to the 'Glossary of Selected Terminology' below for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this Form 10-K and 'Critical Accounting Estimates' below for a discussion of certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgements.\n\n## NON-GAAP MEASURES\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.",

      "question": "How do American Express, Morgan Stanley, and Charles Schwab each approach incentive compensation in terms of structure, disclosure, and trend, and what does this reveal about their talent retention strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "American Express includes incentive compensation within its broader employee benefit obligations, indicating it is a material component of its liabilities. Morgan Stanley highlights that incentive compensation is a discretionary component of total compensation, determined after assessing firm, business unit, and individual performance, particularly for Institutional Securities employees. Charles Schwab saw a 15% decrease in incentive compensation in 2023 compared to 2022, suggesting a strategic reduction in variable pay. Together, these perspectives show that while all three firms use incentive compensation, they differ in how they structure and disclose it, with Schwab reducing incentives amid cost controls, Morgan Stanley using discretion tied to performance, and American Express treating it as a standard liability component.",

        "Hop 1: AXP \u2192 Incentive Compensation: AXP includes incentive compensation under 'employee benefit plan obligations' in its liabilities, indicating it is a standard and material part of its compensation structure.",

      "question": "How do AXP, C, and GS each describe the impact of rising funding costs on their liquidity, capital management strategies, and ability to maintain competitive deposit offerings, and what do these perspectives reveal about their differing business models and risk profiles?",
      "answer": "AXP highlights that rising funding costs could adversely affect its ability to maintain cost-effective deposit balances, especially as it increasingly relies on direct retail deposits for funding. Citi (C) notes that increased competition for deposits, combined with higher interest rates, has raised its funding costs and could strain its liquidity if deposit outflows accelerate. In contrast, GS does not directly discuss deposit funding or rising funding costs in the context of liquidity constraints, but instead emphasizes how higher risk management costs and market volatility could increase its overall cost of capital. Comparing these perspectives reveals that AXP and C are more directly exposed to consumer deposit markets and are thus more sensitive to interest rate-driven funding cost increases, while GS appears to face funding pressures more indirectly through risk and capital management in its trading and investment activities.",

Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. We are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve for review that include, among other things, projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock. As part of the capital planning and stress testing process, our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment. If we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, including the stress capital buffer, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\n\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our preferred stock.\n\nWe rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and such dividends may be limited by law, regulation or supervisory policy. For example, AENB is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends. These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations, make dividend payments or otherwise achieve strategic objectives.\n\nAny future reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express. For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see 'Supervision and Regulation - Stress Testing and Capital Planning' and '- Dividends and Other Capital Distributions' under 'Business,' as well as 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity - Dividends and Share Repurchases' under 'MD&amp;A' and Note 22 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements.'\n\n## Adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\n\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flex ibility. Additional factors affecting the ex tent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## Any reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRatings of our long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, and the macroeconomic environment. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends, in part, on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts. If we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of our asset-backed securities, it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets.\n\n## Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations.\n\nDuring 2024, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nPolitical and economic conditions could continue to cause changes in the values of currencies and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our net revenues. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members' currency can also affect their ability to make payment to us. Foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them and the availability of foreign exchange could further impact our results of operations.\n\n## An inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.\n\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits and uses the proceeds as a source of funding, with our direct retail deposits becoming a larger proportion of our funding over time. We continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. Additionally, a decrease in confidence in the soundness of us or in the banking sector more broadly, such as following the occurrence of bank failures, or in the level of insurance available on deposits may cause rapid deposit withdrawals or an unwillingness to maintain deposits with us,",

          "chunk_text": "and financial institutions for both institutional and consumer deposits, which represent Citi's most stable and lowest cost source of long-term funding. The competition for deposits has continued to increase in recent years, including as a result of quantitative tightening by central banks and fixed income alternatives for customer funds.\n\nCiti's costs to obtain and access wholesale funding are directly related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and its credit spreads. Changes in Citi's credit spreads are driven by both external market factors and factors specific to Citi, such as negative views by investors of the financial services industry or Citi's financial prospects, and can be highly volatile. For additional information on Citi's primary sources of funding, see 'Managing Global RiskLiquidity Risk' below.\n\nCiti's ability to obtain funding may be impaired and its cost of funding could also increase if other market participants are seeking to access the markets at the same time or to a greater ex tent than expected, or if market appetite for corporate debt securities declines, as is likely to occur in a liquidity stress event or other market crisis. In such circumstances, Citi's ability to sell assets may also be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time or a liquid market does not exist for such assets. Additionally, unexpected changes in client needs due to idiosyncratic events or market conditions could result in greater than ex pected drawdowns from off-balance sheet committed facilities. A sudden drop in market liquidity could also cause a temporary or protracted dislocation of capital markets activity. In addition, clearing organizations, central banks, clients and financial institutions with which Citi interacts may ex ercise the right to require additional collateral during challenging market conditions, which could further impair Citi's liquidity. If Citi fails to effectively manage its liquidity, its businesses, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\n\nLimitations on the payments that Citigroup Inc. receives from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity. As a holding company, Citigroup Inc. relies on interest, dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations. Several of Citi's U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity, regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments, including any local regulatory stress test requirements and inter-affiliate arrangements entered into in connection with Citigroup Inc.'s resolution plan. Citigroup Inc.'s broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses.\n\nA bank holding company is also required by law to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. As a result, the FRB may require Citigroup Inc. to commit resources to its subsidiary banks even if doing so is not otherwise in the interests of Citigroup Inc. or its shareholders or creditors, reducing the amount of funds available to meet its obligations.\n\n## A Ratings Downgrade Could Adversely Impact Citi's Funding and Liquidity.\n\nThe credit rating agencies, such as Fitch Ratings, Moody's Ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings, continuously evaluate Citi and certain of its subsidiaries. Their ratings of Citi and its rated subsidiaries' long-term debt and short-term obligations are based on firm-specific factors, including the financial strength of Citi and such subsidiaries, as well as factors that are not entirely within the control of Citi and its subsidiaries, such as the agencies' proprietary rating methodologies and assumptions, potential impact from negative actions on U.S. sovereign ratings and conditions affecting the financial services industry and markets generally.\n\nA ratings downgrade could result from, among other factors, delays or missteps in Citi's transformation efforts, including risk management and internal controls improvements, public statements by Citi's management or regulators, operational risk charges, control failures, substantial failure to meet cost targets, deterioration in Citi's funding structure or liquidity, declines in profitability, significant increases in risk appetite or material reductions in regulatory capitalization levels.\n\nCiti and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings and outlooks. Ratings downgrades could negatively impact Citi and its rated subsidiaries' ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds as well as increase credit spreads and the costs of those funds. A ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on Citi and its rated subsidiaries' ability to obtain funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity and the impact from derivative triggers, which could require Citi and its rated subsidiaries to meet cash obligations and collateral requirements or permit counterparties to terminate certain contracts. In addition, a ratings downgrade could have a negative impact on other funding sources such as secured financing and other margined transactions for which there may be no explicit triggers.\n\nFurthermore, a credit ratings downgrade could have impacts that may not be currently known to Citi or are not possible to quantify. Some of Citi's counterparties and clients could have ratings limitations on their permissible counterparties, of which Citi may or may not be aware. Certain of Citi's corporate customers and trading counterparties, among other clients, could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit the trading of certain market instruments, and limit or withdraw deposits placed with Citi in response to ratings downgrades. Changes in customer and counterparty behavior could impact not only Citi's funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of certain Citi businesses. For additional information on the potential impact of a reduction in Citi's or Citibank's credit ratings, see 'Managing Global Risk-Liquidity RiskPotential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades' below.",

Our risk management process  seeks  to  balance  our  ability  to  profit  from  marketmaking,  investing  or  lending  positions,  and  underwriting  activities,  with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the  judgments  that  accompany  their  application  cannot  anticipate  every economic  and  financial  outcome  or  the  specifics  and  timing  of  such outcomes. Thus, in the course of our activities, we have incurred and may in the future incur losses. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented  dislocations  and  highlight  the  limitations  inherent  in  using historical data to manage risk.\n\nThe models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of  various  asset  classes  or  other  market  indicators.  In  times  of  market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators  may  become  correlated,  or  conversely  previously  correlated indicators  may  move  in  different  directions.  These  types  of  market movements  have  at times limited the effectiveness of our  hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so  in  the  future.  These  changes  in  correlation  have  been  and  may  in  the future  be  exacerbated  where  other  market  participants  are  using  risk  or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations,  including  circumstances  where  asset  values  are  declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets.\n\nIn  addition,  the  use  of  models  in  connection  with  risk  management  and numerous  other  critical  activities  presents  risks  that  the  models  may  be ineffective, either because of poor design, ineffective testing, or improper or flawed inputs, as well as unpermitted access to the models resulting in unapproved or malicious changes to the model or its inputs.\n\nTo  the  extent  that  we  have  positions  through  our  market-making  or origination activities or we make investments directly through our investing  activities,  including  private  equity  or  private  credit,  that  do  not have  an  established  liquid  trading  market  or  are  otherwise  subject  to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with those positions. In addition, to  the  extent  permitted  by  applicable  law  and  regulation,  we  invest  our own capital in private equity,  credit,  real  estate  and  hedge  funds  that  we manage  and  limitations  on  our  ability  to  withdraw  some  or  all  of  our investments  in these funds,  whether  for  legal, reputational or  other reasons,  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  control  the  risk  exposures relating to these investments.\n\nPrudent risk management, as well as regulatory restrictions, may cause us to  limit  our  exposure  to  counterparties,  geographic  areas  or  markets, which may limit  our  business  opportunities  and  increase  the  cost  of  our funding or hedging activities.\n\nOur  consumer  offerings  present  us  with  different  risks,  and  we  have needed and continue to need to expand and adapt our risk monitoring and mitigation  activities  to  account  for  these  business  activities.  A  failure  to adequately assess and control such risk exposures has in the past resulted and could in the future result in losses to us.\n\nFor further information about our risk management policies and procedures,  see  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.",

      "question": "How do American Express, Bank of America, and Capital One each characterize the impact of credit ratings on their funding costs, and what does this reveal about their sensitivity to external credit assessments?",
      "answer": "American Express notes that downgrades in credit ratings could result in higher funding costs and reduced borrowing capacity, particularly in the unsecured debt and asset securitization markets, though it believes its deposit mix may mitigate some of this impact. Bank of America emphasizes that its borrowing costs and funding sources are significantly influenced by credit ratings, and it actively maintains high-quality ratings through engagement with rating agencies. Capital One highlights that credit ratings affect its access to capital markets and borrowing costs, though it does not provide specific mitigants or details on its funding structure. Together, the three firms show varying degrees of emphasis on credit ratings as a determinant of funding costs, with AXP and BAC offering more detailed perspectives on the relationship, while COF provides a more general framing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AXP \u2192 Funding Costs: AXP states that credit rating downgrades could result in higher funding costs and reduced borrowing capacity in unsecured and securitization markets, but FDIC-insured deposits may reduce this impact.",
        "Hop 2: BAC \u2192 Funding Costs: BAC explicitly ties its funding costs and access to capital markets to its credit ratings and notes that it actively manages its relationship with rating agencies to maintain favorable ratings.",
        "Hop 3: COF \u2192 Funding Costs: COF acknowledges that credit ratings affect its access to capital markets and borrowing costs but does not elaborate on specific mitigants or structural protections like AXP or BAC."

      "answer": "American Express reported a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.2% as of December 31, 2024, with its national bank subsidiary maintaining the same ratio at 11.6%. Citigroup, while not providing a specific Tier 1 Capital ratio, emphasized its adherence to regulatory requirements, including being 'well capitalized' with a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, and highlighted its rigorous capital planning processes under CCAR and DFAST stress testing frameworks. Morgan Stanley, in contrast, reported a much higher Tier 1 Capital ratio of 18.0% under the Standardized Approach and 17.8% under the Advanced Approach as of December 31, 2024, exceeding its required minimums of 15.0% and 11.5%, respectively. This indicates that Morgan Stanley maintains a more conservative capital position, likely reflecting a more risk-averse strategy or a response to its complex risk profile. Citigroup's focus on regulatory stress testing and qualitative capital planning suggests a strategic emphasis on compliance and resilience under adverse conditions, while American Express maintains a stable but less elevated capital buffer, aligning with its business model focused on premium credit and charge cards.",

          "chunk_text": "considered 'well capitalized.' Citibank was 'well capitalized' as of December 31, 2024. Furthermore, to be 'well capitalized' under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0% and not be subject to a FRB directive to maintain higher capital levels.\n\n## Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning\n\nCiti is subject to an annual assessment by the FRB as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs: the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST).\n\nFor the largest and most complex firms, such as Citi, CCAR includes a qualitative evaluation of a firm's abilities to determine its capital needs on a forward-looking basis. In conducting the qualitative assessment, the FRB evaluates firms' capital planning practices, focusing on six areas of capital planning: governance, risk management, internal controls, capital policies, incorporating stressful conditions and events, and estimating impact on capital positions. As part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates Citi's capital adequacy, capital adequacy process and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common share repurchases. The FRB assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks.\n\nAll CCAR firms, including Citi, are subject to a rigorous evaluation of their capital planning process. Firms with weak practices may be subject to a deficient supervisory rating, and potentially an enforcement action, for failing to meet supervisory expectations. For additional information regarding CCAR, see 'Risk Factors-Strategic Risks' below.\n\nDFAST is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi's regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the FRB and the general public as to how Citi's regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the FRB. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the FRB.\n\nBoth CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under two supervisory scenarios (baseline and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\nIn addition, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under several scenarios on Citibank's regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as to how Citibank's regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank's capital planning process.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank are required to disclose the results of their company-run stress tests.",

MetLife, while not providing a direct numerical figure for its credit loss provision, highlighted its allowance rollforward and impairment losses in its fixed maturity securities, signaling exposure to credit risk in its investment portfolio. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, disclosed a significantly higher provision for credit losses at $264 million in 2024, suggesting a more cautious approach or higher perceived credit risk in its loan or investment portfolio.

      "answer": "American Express increased its Card Member loans reserve for credit losses in 2024 primarily due to higher loans outstanding and increased delinquencies observed in 2023. Citigroup provides granular performance data on modified consumer loans, including delinquency trends and gross credit losses for borrowers in financial distress, indicating a focus on tracking delinquencies in a segmented, post-modification context. JPMorgan Chase notes that extraordinary events could lead to higher delinquencies, which would result in increased credit loss allowances and net charge-offs, directly impacting earnings. Together, these disclosures show that while all three banks recognize delinquencies as a key driver of credit loss provisioning, they differ in how they segment and disclose the financial impact, with Citigroup offering the most detailed loan modification performance data, JPMorgan linking delinquency risk to macro-level disruptions, and American Express emphasizing the direct link between loan growth and delinquency-driven reserve increases.",

        "Hop 1: AXP \u2192 Delinquencies: AXP increased its credit loss reserves in 2024 due to higher loans outstanding and specifically called out increased delinquencies in 2023 as a contributing factor.",
        "Hop 2: C \u2192 Delinquencies: C disclosed detailed tables showing delinquencies and gross credit losses for permanently modified consumer loans, highlighting a structured approach to tracking delinquencies among financially distressed borrowers.",
        "Hop 3: JPM \u2192 Delinquencies: JPM linked potential increases in delinquencies to broader operational and macroeconomic risks, noting that such increases could lead to higher credit loss allowances and negatively impact earnings."

      "question": "How do BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley each incorporate Assets Under Management (AUM) into their revenue models, and what does this reveal about their differing sensitivities to market-driven AUM fluctuations?",
      "answer": "BlackRock evaluates AUM as a key input in its impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles, factoring in AUM growth rates and market conditions to determine fair value. JPMorgan reports AUM-based investment management fees as a core component of its asset management revenue, with fees collected based on the value of managed assets and performance targets. Morgan Stanley ties AUM directly to its asset management revenues, which are largely based on the net asset value of client accounts and performance-based fees from investment vehicles. The synthesis reveals that BlackRock\u2019s AUM sensitivity is tied to asset valuation and impairment risk, JPMorgan\u2019s to contractual fee structures and performance thresholds, and Morgan Stanley\u2019s to advisory and performance-linked revenue streams, showing distinct financial exposures to AUM volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BLK \u2192 AUM: BlackRock uses AUM, projected AUM growth rates, and market conditions as significant quantitative inputs in assessing the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, indicating AUM's critical role in asset valuation and impairment risk.",
        "Hop 2: JPM \u2192 AUM: JPMorgan earns investment management fees based on the value of assets under management, with performance-based fees accrued when performance targets are met, showing a direct link between AUM and recurring revenue generation.",
        "Hop 3: MS \u2192 AUM: Morgan Stanley\u2019s asset management revenues are primarily based on the net asset value of client accounts and performance-based fees from investment vehicles, highlighting AUM as a core revenue driver with sensitivity to market performance."

MET notes business growth as a factor in revenue increases in certain international markets, such as Korea and Australia, despite overall revenue declines in Asia.

      "question": "How do American Express (AXP), PayPal (PYPL), and Charles Schwab (SCHW) each characterize their liquidity needs in relation to credit risk exposure, funding market conditions, and capital structure management, and what does this reveal about their differing sensitivities to external financial pressures?",
      "answer": "American Express (AXP) highlights that adverse market conditions and interest rate fluctuations could significantly impact its liquidity and access to capital, particularly through unsecured debt and securitization markets. AXP estimates that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could reduce its annual net interest income by up to $206 million, and it expresses concern over the discontinuation of LIBOR and its potential impact on funding costs and liquidity. PayPal (PYPL) emphasizes that growth in its loan receivables portfolio increases liquidity needs, and it actively seeks external funding sources to support credit products. It has designated $2.7 billion of European customer balances for credit activities under CSSF regulations, showing a strategic reliance on internal capital reallocation and external partnerships. Charles Schwab (SCHW) notes that its credit exposures\u2014particularly in margin lending, mortgage loans, and HELOCs\u2014pose liquidity risks, especially during periods of market volatility or economic downturns. It also states that a significant credit rating downgrade could raise borrowing costs and restrict access to capital markets. Together, these perspectives reveal that AXP is most sensitive to macro-level interest rate and funding market shifts, PYPL is focused on scaling credit products through internal and external capital strategies, and SCHW faces liquidity pressures tied to client defaults and broader economic conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings.\n\nOur interest expense was approximately $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease. As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on our annual net interest income of up to $206 million. A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change if benchmark interest rates change. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see 'Risk Management - Market Risk Management Process' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## The discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements.\n\nCertain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements will need to be amended or otherwise modified to replace references to the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) with an alternative reference rate, as the LIBOR tenors referenced are expected to be quoted only through June 2023. Alternative reference rates, such as the secured overnight financing rate, are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate differently than, and not be representative of, LIBOR. In order to compensate for these differences, certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment. However, there is no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR, either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements.\n\nUncertainty as to the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference rates and the discontinuance of LIBOR generally may negatively impact market liquidity, our access to funding and the trading market for our financial instruments. Furthermore, the timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could be subject to disputes, could cause the interest payable on our outstanding financial instruments and commercial agreements to be materially different than expected and may impact the value of such instruments and agreements.\n\n## Adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\n\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. Additional factors affecting the extent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## Any reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRatings of our long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, and the macroeconomic environment. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends, in part, on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts. If we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of our asset-backed securities, it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets.\n\n## Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital.\n\nDuring 2021, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them. Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign",

          "chunk_text": "## Credit ratings\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  we  continue  to  be  rated  investment  grade  by  Standard  and  Poor's  Financial  Services,  LLC,  Fitch Ratings,  Inc.,  and  Moody's  Investors  Services  Inc.  We  expect  that  these  credit  rating  agencies  will  continue  to  monitor  our performance,  including  our  capital  structure  and  results  of  operations.  Our  goal  is  to  be  rated  investment  grade,  but  as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our Credit Agreement.\n\n## CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS\n\nOur  material  cash  requirements  include  funds  to  support  current  and  potential:  operating  activities,  credit  products,  customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, and capital expenditures and other future obligations.\n\n## Credit products\n\nGrowth in our portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs, and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely  affect  our  business. We  continue  to  evaluate  partnerships  and  third  party  sources  of  funding  for  our  loans  receivable portfolio.\n\nIn June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the 'CSSF') agreed that PayPal's management may designate up to 35% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used for European and U.S. credit activities. During the first quarter of 2021, an additional $700 million was approved to fund such credit activities. As of December 31, 2021, the cumulative  amount  approved  by  management  to  be  designated  for  credit  activities  aggregated  to  $2.7 billion and represented approximately 27% of European customer balances that have been made available for our corporate use at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. While our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.\n\nIn April 2020, PayPal was approved to participate in the PPP administered by the SBA. The program was designed to provide a direct  incentive  for  small  businesses  to  keep  their  workers  on  payroll  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic and includes initial loan repayment  deferrals  and  debt  forgiveness  provisions  for  eligible  borrowers.  Loans  made  under  this  program  are  funded  by  an independent  chartered  financial  institution  that  we  partner  with,  and  the  related  receivables  are  not  purchased  by  PayPal.  We receive a fee for providing origination services and loan servicing for the loans and retain operational risk related to those activities.\n\n## Customer protection programs\n\nThe risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in  regulatory  requirements.  For  the  periods  presented  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report,  our transaction loss rates have ranged between 0.09% and 0.15% of TPV. Historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results. The duration and severity of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions remain unknown. The negative impacts on macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of merchant bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption, which may result in an adverse impact on our transaction losses, particularly for merchants that sell goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use.\n\n## Stock repurchases\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately $3.4 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in July 2018.  As of December  31, 2021, a total of approximately $5.1 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2018 stock repurchase program.

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\nWhen available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs, we may seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC, CS&amp;Co, and TDAC maintain uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company's credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\n## We may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures.\n\nOur businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients' options and futures trading, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor.\n\nWhen clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients' indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses, especially if there is a lack of liquidity. As a result of our TD Ameritrade acquisition, our margin, options and futures business has materially increased and market liquidity may represent an increased risk.\n\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss. The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of multiple factors. If management determines that a security's decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss, an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings. Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time.\n\nOur bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors, including from the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense, as well as write downs on such loans.\n\nHeightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:\n\n- Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;\n- Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and\n- Client margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index, or industry.\n\nWe sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause us to take significant charges, could reduce our liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements. If we choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, we could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.",

Capital One notes that its ability to pay dividends is largely dependent on subsidiary distributions, with $8.9 billion available for dividend payments from its bank subsidiary as of December 31, 2024, and that its capital position influences the timing and amount of stock repurchases. JPMorgan Chase warns that adverse economic conditions, market dislocations, and credit deterioration could negatively impact its capital position by increasing risk-weighted assets and reducing profitability, particularly in its consumer businesses. Collectively, these perspectives reveal that while all three banks face regulatory constraints, BAC is most directly impacted by CCAR-driven buffers, COF is constrained by internal capital availability and subsidiary restrictions, and JPM faces broader macroeconomic and credit risk pressures.",

Pursuant  to  the Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits are $250,000 per depositor, per  insured  bank  for  each  account  ownership  category .  All  insured  depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in order to fund the DIF.\n\nThe FDIC is required to maintain a statutory minimum ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the U.S. of at least 1.35 percent and has established a long-term goal of a two percent DIF ratio. As of the date of this report, the DIF is below the statutory minimum ratio and the FDIC's long-term goal. In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a restoration  plan  that  includes  an  increase  in  deposit  insurance  assessments across the industry of two basis points (bps). The FDIC has indicated that it intends to maintain such assessment rates for the foreseeable future. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. The FDIC also has the authority to charge special assessments from time to time, including in connection with systemic risk events. For example, in 2023, the FDIC issued its final rule to impose a special assessment to recover the loss to the DIF resulting from the closure of Silicon V alley Bank and Signature Bank. For more information on the impact to the Corporation of the FDIC special assessment, see Note 12 Commitments  and  Contingencies to  th e  Consolid ated   Financial  Statements.  For more  information  regarding  deposit  insurance,  see  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  Regulatory, Compliance and Legal on page 17.\n\n## Capital, Liquidity and Operational Requirements\n\nAs a financial holding company, we and our bank subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity rules issued by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, including the OCC and the FDIC. These rules are complex and continue  to  evolve  as  U.S.  and  international  regulatory  authorities  propose  and enact  amendments to these rules.  The  Corporation  seeks  to  manage  its  capital position  to  maintain  sufficient  capital  to  satisfy  th ese  regulatory  rules  and  to support  our  business  activities.  These  continually  evolving  rules  are  likely  to influence our planning processes and may require additional regulatory capital and liq uid ity ,  a s  w e ll  a s  im p o se   a d d itio na l  o p e ra tio na l  a nd   co m p lia nce   co sts  o n  th e Corporation.\n\nFor more information on regulatory capital rules and capital composition, see Capital  Management  on  page  48, Note  1 6  -  Regulatory  Requirements  and Restrictions to  th e   Co nsolid a te d   Fina ncia l  Sta te m e nts,  w h ich   a re   inco rp o ra te d   b y reference in this Item 1, and Item 1A.

For instance, Federal Reserve regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).\n\nOur ability to pay dividends and make common stock repurchases depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels  above  minimum requirements plus buffers and non-capital standards established under the FDICIA. To the extent that the Federal Reserve increases our stress capital  buffer  (SCB),  global  systemically  important  bank  (G-SIB)  surcharge  or countercyclical  capital  buffer,  our  returns  of  capital  to  sh areh old ers,  includ ing dividends and common stock repurchases, could decrease. As part of its CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business  using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test results, which may impact the level of our SCB. For example, based on the results of our 202 4 CCAR stress test, the Corporation's SCB increased to 3.2 percent. Additionally , the Corporation's G-SIB surcharge increased to  3.0  percent  on  January  1,  202 4.  The  Federal  Reserve  could  also  impose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends  or  repurchasing  common  stock,  including  as  a  result  of  economic disruptions or events.\n\nIf  th e  Fed era l  R eserve  find s  th a t  a   b a nk  is  not  'well-ca p ita lized '  or  'wellmanaged,' the bank's BHC would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to its activities.  A d d itiona lly ,  th e   a p p lica b le   fe d e ra l  re gula to ry  a uth o rity  is  a uth o rize d   to determine,  under  certain  circumstances  relating  to  the  financial  condition  of  a bank or BHC, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof.\n\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. The rights of the Corporation, our shareholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries are further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries.\n\nFor  more  information  regarding  distributions,  including  the  minimum  capital requirements, see Note  13  -  Shareholders'  Equity and Note  1 6  -  Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to th e Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Resolution Planning\n\nAs a BHC with greater than $250 billion of assets, every two years the Corporation is required by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.\n\nSuch  resolution  plan  is  intended  to  be  a  detailed  roadmap  for  the  orderly resolution of the BHC, including the continued operations or solvent wind down of its  material  entities,  pursuant  to  th e  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code  under  one  or  more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance.\n\nIf both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that the BHC's plan is not credible,  th e  Fed eral  R eserve  and   th e  FDIC  may  jointly  impose  more  stringent capital,  leverage  or  liq uid ity  req uirements  or  restrictions  on  growth ,  activities  or operations. A summary of our plan is available on the Federal Reserve and FDIC websites.\n\nThe FDIC also requires the submission of a resolution plan for Bank of America, National  Association  (BANA),  which  must  describe  how  the  insured  depository institution would be resolved under the bank resolution provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. A description of this plan is available on the FDIC's website.",

For additional information related to capital distributions as a result of the capital plan resubmission, see 'Capital Management-Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing' in this Report.\n\nAs a BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. The Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions that limit its ability to transfer funds to our BHC. As of December 31, 2024, funds available for dividend payments from the Bank were $8.9 billion. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.\n\nWe repurchased $150 million of shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2024 and $553 million of shares of our common stock during the year ended 2024. The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. The Board authorized stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases, tender offers, or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, does not have a set expiration date and may be suspended at any time.

This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorganChase's credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair v alue losses in its market-making businesses and inv estment portfolios. In addition, JPMorganChase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses or establish other reserv es with respect to certain clients, industries or country exposures in order to align with directiv es or expectations of its banking regulators.\n\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of counterparties, borrowers or other obligors not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherev er located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorganChase's consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorganChase. JPMorganChase regularly monitors v arious segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its ability to div ersify or hedge its exposure against those risks may be limited.\n\nJPMorganChase's consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorganChase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorganChase's consumer businesses may earn lower rev enues in such an env ironment.\n\nIf JPMorganChase is unable to reduce positions effectiv ely during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the lev el of risk-weighted-assets ('RWA') that JPMorganChase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adv ersely affect JPMorganChase's capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nJPMorganChase's ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its  liquidity is  cons trained.\n\nJPMorganChase's liquidity can be impacted at any giv en time as a result of factors such as:\n\n- market-wide illiquidity or disruption\n- changes in liquidity or capital requirements resulting from changes in laws, rules and regulations, including those in response to economic effects of systemic ev ents\n- actions taken by the U.S. gov ernment or by the Federal Reserv e to reduce its balance sheet, which may reduce deposits held by JPMorganChase and other financial institutions\n- inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at fav orable times or prices\n- default by a CCP or other significant market participant\n- unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\n- unexpected loss of deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lendingrelated commitments, and\n- lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorganChase or financial institutions in general.\n\nA reduction in JPMorganChase's liquidity may be caused by ev ents ov er which it has little or no control. For example, periods of market stress, low inv estor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorganChase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity.\n\nJPMorganChase may need to raise funding from alternativ e sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternativ e sources of funding could be more expensiv e or limited in av ailability. JPMorganChase's funding costs could also be negativ ely affected by actions that JPMorganChase may take in order to:\n\n- satisfy applicable liquidity cov erage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements\n- address obligations under its resolution plan, or\n- satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.\n\nMore generally, if JPMorganChase fails to effectiv ely manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or inv est in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adv ersely affect its results of operations.",

      "question": "How do JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab differ in accounting for the 1% excise tax on share repurchases, and what do these differences indicate about their financial reporting approaches?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase discloses the 1% excise tax as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 but does not provide specific details on how it accounts for the tax in its financial statements. Mastercard excludes the tax from the dollar value of shares repurchased and records the incremental tax in treasury stock, with a $14.1 billion remaining repurchase authorization. Charles Schwab explicitly recognizes the tax as a direct and incremental cost, recording it as part of the cost basis of treasury stock for common shares and including it within preferred stock dividends for preferred share repurchases, with $8.7 billion remaining under its repurchase program. These differences indicate that while all three firms are subject to the same tax, their reporting approaches vary, with Schwab applying the most detailed recognition methodology and Mastercard treating it as a balance sheet adjustment, whereas JPMorgan offers the least transparency on its specific accounting treatment.",

          "chunk_text": "and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments.\n\n## Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies\n\nNonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS  are  not  reported  as  nonperforming.  When  a  nonaccrual  loan  is  deemed uncollectible, it is ch arged off against th e allowance for credit losses. If th e ch arged off  amount is later  recovered,  the  amount  is  reversed  through  the  allowance  for credit losses at the recovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than charge- offs, net chargeoffs are reported as a negative amount.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Corporation's  policies,  consumer  real  estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured longterm standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or F reddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes  90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estatesecured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy , within 60 days of  receipt  of  notification  of  filing,  with   th e  remaining  balance  classified  as nonperforming.\n\nCredit card and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Consumer vehicle  loans  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  status  when  they  become 90 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon  confirmation  of  fraud,  unless  the  borrower's  performance  indicates  that repayment is likely to occur. These loans are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral less expected disposal costs when the loans become 120 days past due, upon repossession of the collateral, within 60 days after receipt of notification of  b a nkruptcy  or  d eath   or  up on  confirmation  of  fraud ,  and   wh en  th e  b orrower's ability to pay cannot be validated. If repossession of the collateral is not expected, the loans are fully charged off.\n\nCommercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection.\n\nBusiness card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\n\nThe  entire  balance  of  a  consumer  loan  or  commercial  loan  or  lease  is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customer's billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable  is  reversed  when  loans  and  leases  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  status. Interest  collections  on  nonaccruing  loans  and  leases  for  which  the  ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored  to  accrual  status  when  all  principal  and  interest  is  current  and  full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nLoans  that  the  Corporation  intends  to  sell  in  th e  foreseeable  future,  including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases.\n\n## Premises and Equipment\n\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nFor the Corporation's financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For assets  that  are  subject  to  collateral  maintenance  provisions,  including  federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses  are  assumed  to  be zero.  For  all  other  assets,  the  Corporation  performs qualitative  analyses,  including  consideration  of  historical  losses  and  current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset.\n\n## Lessee Arrangements\n\nSubstantially  all  of  th e  Corporation's  lessee  arrangements  are  operating  leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the",

      "question": "How do American Express, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase each quantify or describe the impact of income tax benefits associated with share-based compensation on their financial performance in 2023, and what does this reveal about their respective tax strategies around employee incentive programs?",
      "answer": "American Express reported income tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $110 million in 2023. Bank of America discussed its broader income tax accounting policies, noting that tax benefits are recognized based on a two-step model involving technical merit and settlement likelihood, though it did not specify a dollar amount for share-based compensation benefits. JPMorgan Chase disclosed income tax benefits related to share-based incentive arrangements totaling $836 million in 2023. Comparing these figures reveals differing levels of tax benefit realization from employee compensation programs, with JPMorgan benefiting significantly more on a pretax basis, while Bank of America emphasizes the recognition criteria rather than specific amounts.",

      "answer": "Bank of America reports a Total Capital Ratio of 15.2% under the Standardized Approach and 16.6% under the Advanced Approaches, exceeding the regulatory minimum of 13.0%. JPMorgan Chase shows a Total Capital Ratio of 14.9% under the Standardized Approach and 14.5% under the Advanced Approach, also surpassing the minimum requirement of 10.5% for both methodologies. Charles Schwab, on the other hand, maintains a significantly higher Total Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets ratio of 31.7% for its CSC entity and 38.0% for its CSB entity, indicating a more conservative capital positioning. This comparative analysis reveals that while all three institutions maintain capital well above regulatory floors, Charles Schwab adopts a more risk-averse capital strategy, whereas Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase operate closer to, but still comfortably above, their required thresholds.",

      "question": "How do American Express (AXP), Capital One (COF), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) each disclose their exposure to the credit card segment, and what does this reveal about their differing business models and risk profiles in 2024?",
      "answer": "American Express (AXP) emphasizes its integrated global payments model, with credit cards being a core component of its U.S. Consumer Services and International Card Services segments, generating significant discount revenue and interest income. Capital One (COF) highlights its diversified financial services approach, with the credit card segment being one of its three major business lines, indicating a strategic focus on consumer lending and digital innovation. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reports a massive $1.001 trillion in credit card contractual exposure as of December 31, 2024, underscoring its dominant position in the consumer credit card market and its role as a systemic player in consumer credit. Together, these disclosures reveal that while all three firms are deeply involved in the credit card space, AXP operates more as a payments network with card issuance, COF focuses on digital-first card products as part of a broader consumer banking strategy, and JPM maintains a large-scale, balance sheet-intensive credit card portfolio that reflects its broader wholesale and retail banking integration.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&amp;A)\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## BUSINESS INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are a globally integrated payments company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), Commercial Services (CS), International Card Services (ICS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate &amp; Other.\n\nOur range of products and services includes:\n\n- Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products\n- Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, fraud prevention, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants\n- Network services\n- Travel and lifestyle services\n- Expense management products and services\n- Other services, such as the design and operation of customer loyalty programs\n\nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services:\n\n- Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, primarily represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for card-not-present transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States;\n- Interest income, principally represents interest earned on outstanding loan balances;\n- Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account;\n- Service fees and other revenue, primarily represent service fees earned from merchants and other customers, foreign currency-related fees charged to Card Members, Card Member delinquency fees, travel commissions and fees, and income (losses) from our investments in which we have significant influence; and\n- Processed revenue, primarily represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners.\n\nRefer to the 'Glossary of Selected Terminology' below for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this Form 10-K and 'Critical Accounting Estimates' below for a discussion of certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgements.\n\n## NON-GAAP MEASURES\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.",

Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the 'Company' or 'Capital One') offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branch locations, caf\u00e9s and other distribution channels.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Capital One Financial Corporation's principal operating subsidiary was Capital One, National Association ('CONA'). The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as 'we,' 'us' or 'our.' CONA is referred to as the 'Bank.'\n\nWe also offer products outside of the United States of America ('U.S.') principally through Capital One (Europe) plc ('COEP'), an indirect subsidiary of CONA organized and located in the United Kingdom ('U.K.'), and through a branch of CONA in Canada. Both COEP and our Canadian branch of CONA have the authority to provide credit card loans.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of any recent material acquisitions into our business segments, and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in 'Note 18-Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers.'\n\n## Basis of Presentation and Use of E stimates\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ('U.S. GAAP'). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgments, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity ('V OE') or a variable interest entity ('V IE'). All intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Voting Interest Entities\n\nVOEs are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that give them the power to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations. Since a controlling financial interest in an entity is typically obtained through ownership of a majority voting interest, we consolidate our majority-owned subsidiaries and other voting interest entities in which we hold, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where we exercise control through other contractual rights.\n\nInvestments in which we do not hold a controlling financial interest but have significant influence over the entity's financial and operating decisions are accounted for under the equity method. If we do not have significant influence, we measure equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through net income, except those that do not have a readily determinable fair value (for which a measurement alternative is applied). We report equity investments in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and include our share of income or loss for investments accounted for under the equity method and dividends from other equity investments in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. The carrying value of investments included in other assets, excluding tax advantage investments, totaled $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which primarily  included equity investments measured using the alternative measurement method and equity method investments. The carrying value of equity investments measured using the alternative measurement method totaled $757 million and $669 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n\n## CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

      "question": "How do Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase each quantify their exposure to investment-grade loans, and what does this reveal about their relative risk appetite and strategic focus in corporate lending?",
      "answer": "Citigroup reports that approximately 90% of its total U.K. funded loans were investment grade as of December 31, 2024. Goldman Sachs discloses $19.773 billion in investment-grade commercial lending commitments maturing in 2025, with a growing exposure through 2029. JPMorgan Chase reports $265.8 billion in total investment-grade retained loans as of December 31, 2023, dwarfing both Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.

(Including the U.S., Citi's top 25 ex posures by country would represent approximately 98% of Citi's exposure to all countries as of December 31, 2024.)\n\nin order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an ex ample, with respect to the U.K., only 43% of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled counterparties (47% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of the loans predominately to counterparties domiciled in other European countries. Approximately 90% of the total U.K. funded loans and 87% of the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade as of December 31, 2024.\n\nTrading account assets and investment securities are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional information on the assets included in the table, see the footnotes to the table below.\n\nFor purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland,\n\nFor additional information on Citi's country exposure, see 'FFIEC-Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local Country Assets' below.\n\n",

      "answer": "Bank of America reported short-term borrowings of $883 million in 2023, reflecting a significant increase from prior periods, indicating a growing reliance on short-term financing. JPMorgan Chase's 2021 data shows short-term borrowings at $2,481 million, with high turnover due to issuances and settlements, suggesting a more dynamic and substantial use of short-term borrowings as part of its broader liability management. MetLife, in contrast, had short-term borrowings of $119 million in 2023, with no comparable figure disclosed for 2022, implying a much smaller and potentially more limited role for short-term borrowings in its capital structure.

      "question": "How do American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), and Capital One (COF) each disclose their exposure to the credit card segment, and what does this reveal about their respective risk profiles and strategic positioning in the consumer credit market?",
      "answer": "American Express (AXP) generates significant revenue from credit card products, including interest income, annual fees, and merchant discount fees, which are influenced by transaction volumes and card usage patterns. Bank of America (BAC) reports $102.2 billion in credit card outstandings, with $2.4 billion in past-due balances, indicating credit risk exposure and delinquency trends in its consumer credit card portfolio. Capital One (COF) organizes its operations into three major segments, with the Credit Card segment being a core pillar of its business model, reflecting strategic emphasis on this area. When combined, these perspectives reveal that AXP monetizes card usage through fees and merchant relationships, BAC faces measurable credit quality challenges in its card portfolio, and COF strategically structures its business around the credit card segment, suggesting differing risk appetites and revenue strategies across the three firms.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&amp;A)\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## BUSINESS INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are a globally integrated payments company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), Commercial Services (CS), International Card Services (ICS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate &amp; Other.\n\nOur range of products and services includes:\n\n- Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products\n- Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, fraud prevention, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants\n- Network services\n- Travel and lifestyle services\n- Expense management products and services\n- Other services, such as the design and operation of customer loyalty programs\n\nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services:\n\n- Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, primarily represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for card-not-present transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States;\n- Interest income, principally represents interest earned on outstanding loan balances;\n- Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account;\n- Service fees and other revenue, primarily represent service fees earned from merchants and other customers, foreign currency-related fees charged to Card Members, Card Member delinquency fees, travel commissions and fees, and income (losses) from our investments in which we have significant influence; and\n- Processed revenue, primarily represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners.\n\nRefer to the 'Glossary of Selected Terminology' below for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this Form 10-K and 'Critical Accounting Estimates' below for a discussion of certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgements.\n\n## NON-GAAP MEASURES\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.",

Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the 'Company' or 'Capital One') offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branch locations, caf\u00e9s and other distribution channels.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Capital One Financial Corporation's principal operating subsidiary was Capital One, National Association ('CONA'). The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as 'we,' 'us' or 'our.' CONA is referred to as the 'Bank.'\n\nWe also offer products outside of the United States of America ('U.S.') principally through Capital One (Europe) plc ('COEP'), an indirect subsidiary of CONA organized and located in the United Kingdom ('U.K.'), and through a branch of CONA in Canada. Both COEP and our Canadian branch of CONA have the authority to provide credit card loans.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of any recent material acquisitions into our business segments, and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in 'Note 18-Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers.'\n\n## Basis of Presentation and Use of E stimates\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ('U.S. GAAP'). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgments, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity ('V OE') or a variable interest entity ('V IE'). All intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Voting Interest Entities\n\nVOEs are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that give them the power to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations. Since a controlling financial interest in an entity is typically obtained through ownership of a majority voting interest, we consolidate our majority-owned subsidiaries and other voting interest entities in which we hold, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where we exercise control through other contractual rights.\n\nInvestments in which we do not hold a controlling financial interest but have significant influence over the entity's financial and operating decisions are accounted for under the equity method. If we do not have significant influence, we measure equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through net income, except those that do not have a readily determinable fair value (for which a measurement alternative is applied). We report equity investments in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and include our share of income or loss for investments accounted for under the equity method and dividends from other equity investments in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. The carrying value of investments included in other assets, excluding tax advantage investments, totaled $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which primarily  included equity investments measured using the alternative measurement method and equity method investments. The carrying value of equity investments measured using the alternative measurement method totaled $757 million and $669 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n\n## CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

      "question": "How do American Express (AXP), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Morgan Stanley (MS) each position themselves relative to the Tier 1 Capital Ratio requirements, and what does this reveal about their respective regulatory risk profiles and strategic flexibility in capital distribution?",
      "answer": "American Express (AXP) is subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions if its Tier 1 capital ratio does not meet minimum requirements, with a requirement of 8.0% to be classified as 'well capitalized' under the FDIA. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reports a Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.9% under standardized requirements for BHCs and must maintain at least 6.0% to meet minimum well-capitalized thresholds, indicating a strong buffer above regulatory floors. Morgan Stanley (MS) reports a Tier 1 capital ratio of 17.1% as of December 31, 2023, significantly exceeding its required ratio of 14.4%, demonstrating a conservative capital posture. Collectively, these ratios suggest that while all three firms are well capitalized, AXP operates closer to regulatory minimums with tighter constraints on distributions, whereas JPM and particularly MS maintain larger cushions, allowing for greater strategic flexibility in capital deployment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

      "question": "How did the FDIC's special assessment in 2023 impact the operating expenses and financial strategies of Bank of America (BAC), Capital One (COF), and Charles Schwab (SCHW), and what does this reveal about their respective sensitivities to regulatory-driven costs?",
      "answer": "The FDIC's 2023 special assessment had distinct financial impacts across BAC, COF, and SCHW. BAC acknowledged the assessment as part of broader FDIC insurance costs, noting that the FDIC issued a final rule imposing a special assessment to recover losses from the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. COF explicitly recorded a $289 million FDIC special assessment in 2023, which was subtracted from operating expenses to calculate adjusted operating expenses, directly affecting its non-GAAP efficiency ratio. SCHW incurred a $172 million FDIC special assessment in Q4 2023, which was a key component of the increase in regulatory fees and assessments. These figures indicate that while all three firms were subject to the same regulatory event, the magnitude and disclosure of the impact varied, with COF bearing the highest disclosed cost, followed by SCHW, and BAC providing a more qualitative rather than quantitative disclosure. This suggests differing levels of transparency and possibly differing deposit profiles or risk exposures across the firms.",

      "question": "How do Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Charles Schwab each report their Total Leverage Exposure in relation to their Tier 1 Capital, and what does this reveal about their respective capital adequacy strategies in 2024?",
      "answer": "Citigroup reports a Total Leverage Exposure of 'Quarterly adjusted average total assets' and evaluates it in the context of regulatory capital adequacy standards, though it does not explicitly state a dollar figure for Total Leverage Exposure. Goldman Sachs reports its Total Leverage Exposure as $775,170 million in 2024, with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 11.0%. Charles Schwab discloses a Total Leverage Exposure of $461,200 million for CSC and a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 9.9%. These figures suggest varying capital adequacy strategies: Goldman Sachs maintains a higher leverage ratio, indicating a more conservative capital approach, while Charles Schwab operates with a slightly lower leverage ratio, potentially signaling a more aggressive capital utilization. Citigroup frames its leverage exposure within regulatory compliance, suggesting a focus on maintaining minimum capital standards.",

      "question": "How do Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley differ in the composition and scale of their 'Other Loans' portfolios, and what does this reveal about their respective risk appetites and business strategies in non-core lending activities?",
      "answer": "Goldman Sachs reports $1,950 million in 'Other' loans as of December 2024, which is a distinct and relatively small category within its broader wholesale loan portfolio. JPMorgan Chase categorizes $23,499 million in 'Other' loans under wholesale lending as of May 1, 2023, indicating a more significant emphasis on this category compared to GS. Morgan Stanley highlights that its 'Other loans' include exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) properties totaling $7.7 billion as of December 31, 2024, within its Wealth Management segment, with over 95% receiving guarantees from high net worth clients. These differences suggest that JPMorgan has a higher exposure to 'Other Loans,' potentially signaling a broader or more diversified lending strategy, while Morgan Stanley's CRE-backed 'Other Loans' benefit from client guarantees, potentially reducing credit risk. Goldman Sachs maintains the smallest disclosed 'Other Loans' position, suggesting a more conservative or focused approach.",

          "chunk_text": "\nOur target is to achieve pre-tax breakeven by the end of 2025 for Platform Solutions.\n\nOperating Environment. The operating environment for Platform Solutions  is  mainly  impacted  by  the  economic  environment  in  the  U.S., which,  during  2024,  was  generally  characterized  by  concerns  about inflation (although some measures had begun to improve), a continued low rate  of  unemployment  and  a  slight  increase  in  the  pace  of  growth  in consumer spending compared with 2023.\n\nIn the future, if economic conditions deteriorate, it may lead to a decrease in  consumer  spending  or  a  deterioration  in  consumer  credit,  and  net revenues and provision for credit losses in Platform Solutions would likely be negatively impacted.\n\n2024 versus 2023. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were $2.43 billion for 2024, 2% higher than 2023.\n\nNotwithstanding our strategic decision to narrow the focus on consumerrelated  activities,  Consumer  platforms  net  revenues  were  slightly  higher compared  with  2023,  reflecting  higher  average  credit  card  balances  and higher  average  deposit  balances,  largely  offset  by  the  impact  of  the planned  transition  of  the  GM  credit  card  program  to  another  issuer. Transaction banking and other net revenues were lower, primarily reflecting  lower  net  revenues  related  to  the  seller  financing  loan  portfolio that  was  sold  during  2024.  See  'Regulatory  and  Other  Matters  -  Other Matters  -  Narrowing  our  Focus  on  Consumer-Related  Activities'  for further information.\n\nProvision  for  credit  losses  was  $1.54  billion  for  2024,  compared  with $1.14 billion for 2023. Provisions for 2024 reflected net provisions related to the credit card portfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs). The net provision  for  2023  reflected  net  provisions  related  to  the  credit  card portfolio  (primarily  driven  by  net  charge-offs),  partially  offset  by  a  net release related to the GreenSky  loan portfolio (including a reserve reduction related to the transfer of the portfolio to held for sale).\n\nOperating  expenses  were  $1.96  billion  for  2024,  43%  lower  than  2023, primarily due to the write-down of identifiable intangible assets related to GreenSky and an impairment of goodwill related to Consumer platforms in the  prior  year  period.  Pre-tax  loss  was  $1.08  billion  for  2024,  compared with a pre-tax loss of $2.18 billion for 2023.\n\n## Geographic Data\n\nSee Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our total net revenues, pre-tax earnings and net earnings by geographic region.\n\n## Balance Sheet and Funding Sources\n\n## Balance Sheet Management\n\nOne of our risk management disciplines is our ability  to  manage  the  size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to  client  activity,  market  fluctuations  and  business  opportunities,  the  size and  composition  of  our  balance  sheet  also  reflects  factors,  including  (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii)  the  amount of capital we hold and (iii) our funding  profile,  among  other  factors.  See  'Capital  Management  and Regulatory  Capital  -  Capital  Management'  for  information  about  our capital management process.\n\nAlthough  our  balance  sheet  fluctuates  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  our  total assets  at  quarter-end  are  generally  not  materially  different  from  those occurring within our reporting periods.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  appropriate  risk  management,  we  seek  to  maintain  a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii)  setting  balance  sheet  targets,  (iii)  monitoring  of  key  metrics  and  (iv) scenario analyses.",

We  believe  that  the  key  metrics  presented  facilitate  an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\n\nOperaHng  Margin measures  how  much  profit  we  make  on  each  dollar  of  sales  aVer  our  operaEng  costs  but  before  other  income  (expense)  and  income  tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\n\n## Key Drivers\n\nGross Dollar Volume ('GDV') measures dollar volume of acEvity, including both domesEc and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and  U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume; 'purchase volume' means the aggregate dollar amount  of  purchases  made  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period;  and  'cash  volume'  means  the  aggregate  dollar  amount  of  cash disbursements  and  includes  the  impact  of  balance  transfers  and  convenience  checks  obtained  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period. InformaEon denominated in U.S. dollars relaEng to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency i n which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  We report periodover-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency informaEon, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. 1\n\nCross-border Volume Growth measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period, divided by active accounts at the end of the period. The number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period. The number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account.\n\nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV  growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which may be indicators of  current  and  future  performance.  We  present  these  key  metrics  to  enhance  investors'  evaluation  of  the  performance  of  our  business  and operating results.\n\nOur key metrics are  calculated  using  internal  company  data  based  on  the  activity  we  measure  on  our  payments  platform  and  compiled  from  multiple  systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant judgment.\n\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For ex ample, we continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material.\n\n## NET REVENUES\n\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n\n- Transaction revenues : Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis based on the TPV  completed on our payments platform. G rowth in TPV  is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform. We generate additional revenue  from  merchants  and  consumers:  on  transactions  where  we  perform  currency  conversion,  when  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for ex ample, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees.\n- Revenues from other value added services: Net  revenues  derived  primarily  from  revenue  earned  through  partnerships,  referral  fees,  subscription  fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our consumers and merchants. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\n\nOur revenues can be significantly impacted by a number of factors, including the following:\n\n- The mix of merchants, products, and services;\n- The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;\n- The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and\n- The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants.\n\nRefer to 'Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors' in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that may impact our revenue.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan reports $340 million in total gross charge-offs for retained loans in 2023, with the majority ($298 million) coming from non-investment-grade term loans originated in 2023. MetLife discloses gross charge-offs related specifically to commercial mortgage loans, with $58 million in releases tied to discounted payoff losses in 2024. Morgan Stanley notes that its net charge-off ratio is calculated as gross charge-offs net of recoveries divided by total average loans held for investment, indicating a focus on credit performance in its commercial real estate and securities-based lending portfolios. Together, these disclosures highlight differing credit risk exposures: JPMorgan faces broader loan portfolio risks across multiple origination years, MetLife is focused on commercial mortgage loan performance, and Morgan Stanley emphasizes the relationship between gross charge-offs and recoveries in its institutional lending activities.",

      "answer": "Citigroup (C) shows a decline in savings deposits from $197.3 billion in 2023 to $165.5 billion in 2024, with an increase in average interest rate from 1.79% to 2.47%, indicating a tightening of liquidity and a strategy to attract more stable funding at higher cost. Goldman Sachs (GS) emphasizes savings deposits as a diversified funding source, raised through GS Bank USA and other international banking entities, signaling a strategic shift to retail and institutional deposit gathering to reduce reliance on wholesale funding. JPMorgan (JPM) treats savings deposits as part of its fair value disclosures, noting that deposits with no stated maturity (like savings and demand deposits) are carried at fair value equal to their carrying amount, reflecting a conservative and regulatory-compliant valuation approach. Together, these perspectives reveal that while C is experiencing a contraction in savings deposits amid rising rates, GS is actively expanding its deposit base as a strategic funding tool, and JPM is maintaining a cautious, GAAP-aligned valuation stance on these liabilities.",

      "question": "How do AXP, COF, and SCHW each demonstrate their adherence to Tier 1 Leverage Ratio requirements, and what does this reveal about their respective capital adequacy and regulatory positioning in 2023?",
      "answer": "AXP, through its subsidiary AENB, must maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5.0% to be considered 'well capitalized' under the FDIA, which directly impacts its ability to accept brokered deposits and conduct operations without regulatory restrictions. COF explicitly states that it exceeded all minimum capital requirements, including the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, and was well-capitalized under PCA requirements as of December 31, 2023. SCHW reported a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 8.5% for its brokerage entity (CSC) and 10.1% for its bank entity (CSB) in 2023, both significantly above the regulatory minimums, indicating strong capital adequacy and a buffer against financial stress. Collectively, these figures reveal that while all three firms are well-capitalized, SCHW maintains the strongest leverage position, followed by COF, with AXP operating closer to regulatory thresholds, suggesting differing levels of risk exposure and regulatory scrutiny.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AXP \u2192 Tier 1 Leverage Ratio: AXP's subsidiary AENB must maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5.0% to be classified as 'well capitalized,' which affects its ability to accept brokered deposits and operate without regulatory constraints.",
        "Hop 2: COF \u2192 Tier 1 Leverage Ratio: COF states it exceeded all regulatory capital requirements, including the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, and was well-capitalized under PCA as of December 31, 2023, though specific figures are not disclosed.",
        "Hop 3: SCHW \u2192 Tier 1 Leverage Ratio: SCHW disclosed a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 8.5% for CSC and 10.1% for CSB in 2023, both well above minimum thresholds, indicating robust capital strength and regulatory flexibility."

      "question": "How do Bank of America (BAC), Capital One (COF), and Charles Schwab (SCHW) each reflect their regulatory capital frameworks around Tier 1 Leverage, and what does this reveal about their respective capital adequacy strategies and regulatory positioning in 2023?",
      "answer": "Bank of America (BAC) reports a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 7.1% as of year-end 2023, showing a consistent upward trend from 6.4% in 2021. Capital One (COF) does not provide specific numerical disclosures but explains that Tier 1 Leverage is a regulatory capital measure calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets, indicating its adherence to regulatory definitions. Charles Schwab (SCHW) reports a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 8.5% for its CSC subsidiary and 10.1% for CSB in 2023, significantly above the minimum required levels of 4.0%. Collectively, these figures suggest that while BAC and SCHW maintain strong capital positions, SCHW's ratios are notably higher, potentially reflecting a more conservative capital strategy or differing business models subject to distinct regulatory expectations.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 Tier 1 Leverage: BAC discloses a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 7.1% in 2023, up from 6.4% in 2021, indicating a strengthening capital position.",
        "Hop 2: COF \u2192 Tier 1 Leverage: COF provides a regulatory definition of Tier 1 Leverage as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets, showing its compliance framework but without disclosing specific ratios.",

      "question": "How do Capital One (COF), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Charles Schwab (SCHW) each characterize their compliance with the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR), and what does this reveal about their respective capital management strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "Capital One (COF) operates under the Basel III Capital Rules as a Category III institution and is required to maintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) of 3.0%. COF's SLR compliance is influenced by its regulatory capital treatment, including the CECL Transition Election, which allows for a phased-in impact on capital through 2024. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported an SLR of 8.2% as of December 31, 2023, significantly above the minimum required ratio of 3.0%, indicating a conservative capital positioning. Charles Schwab (SCHW) reported an SLR of 8.5% for its Capital Source Corporation (CSC) and 10.0% for its bank subsidiary (CSB) as of December 31, 2023, both well above the 3.0% minimum threshold. These SLR levels suggest that while all three firms meet and exceed regulatory minimums, COF is more focused on navigating transitional capital rules, MS maintains a strong buffer with a consistent SLR trend, and SCHW exhibits a robust SLR profile, particularly in its banking arm, reflecting a potentially more aggressive capital efficiency strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 Supplementary Leverage Ratio: COF, as a Category III institution under Basel III, must maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0%. It also made the CECL Transition Election, allowing a phased-in impact on regulatory capital through 2024.",
        "Hop 2: MS \u2192 Supplementary Leverage Ratio: MS reported an SLR of 8.2% as of December 31, 2023, well above the 3.0% minimum requirement, showing strong capital adequacy.",
        "Hop 3: SCHW \u2192 Supplementary Leverage Ratio: SCHW reported SLR of 8.5% for CSC and 10.0% for CSB as of December 31, 2023, both significantly exceeding the 3.0% minimum, indicating strong capital strength."

      "question": "How do AIG, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley each incorporate equity volatility into their fair value measurements, and what does this reveal about the varying degrees of sensitivity and modeling complexity across their derivative portfolios?",
      "answer": "AIG incorporates equity volatility in the valuation of embedded derivatives within fixed index annuities and index life products, with volatility ranges of 6.45%\u201350.75% and 5.75%\u201323.63%, respectively, indicating a high sensitivity in insurance-linked derivatives. JPMorgan explicitly depends on equity volatility as a key valuation input for equity derivatives, alongside other factors like equity correlation and FX correlation, suggesting a complex, multi-dimensional modeling approach. Morgan Stanley applies equity volatility ranging from 6% to 69% (with a weighted average of 13% at year-end 2023), reflecting a more moderate exposure in its option-based valuations. Together, these disclosures highlight differing modeling philosophies and sensitivities to equity volatility, with AIG showing the highest range, JPMorgan embedding it within broader derivative models, and Morgan Stanley applying a narrower average exposure.",

        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Equity Volatility: AIG discloses equity volatility as a key unobservable input in the valuation of embedded derivatives in fixed index annuities (6.45%\u201350.75%) and index life products (5.75%\u201323.63%).",
        "Hop 2: JPM \u2192 Equity Volatility: JPMorgan depends on equity volatility as a specific input for equity derivatives, alongside equity correlation and equity-FX correlation, within broader derivative pricing models that use both observable and unobservable inputs.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America (BAC), Capital One (COF), and Morgan Stanley (MS) each approach the accounting and disclosure of credit loss allowances, and what does this reveal about their differing risk management strategies and regulatory responses in 2023?",
      "answer": "Bank of America (BAC) applies a detailed, qualitative and quantitative framework to evaluate expected credit losses (ECL) for AFS and HTM debt securities, using discounted cash flow analyses and considering issuer financial condition, default expectations, and collateral value. BAC also maintains a systematic segmentation of its loan portfolio for allowance estimation. Capital One (COF) adopted ASU No. 2022-02 in Q1 2023, which eliminated TDR accounting and introduced enhanced vintage disclosures for loan write-offs by origination year, indicating a shift toward more transparent and forward-looking credit risk reporting. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported a $755 million allowance for credit losses and other reserves as of December 31, 2023, up from $595 million in 2022, reflecting a growing provision for credit risk in its trading inventory, investments, and receivables. Synthesizing these disclosures, BAC emphasizes internal modeling and segmentation, COF aligns with new regulatory disclosure standards, and MS shows increasing reserve buildup, suggesting varying degrees of conservatism and regulatory responsiveness in credit risk management.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 Credit Loss Allowance: BAC uses a comprehensive ECL framework for AFS and HTM securities, incorporating qualitative factors (credit ratings, collateral) and discounted cash flow analysis when necessary. It also segments its loan portfolio into Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card & Other Consumer, and Commercial for allowance estimation.",
        "Hop 2: COF \u2192 Credit Loss Allowance: COF adopted ASU 2022-02 in 2023, which eliminated TDR accounting and required gross write-off disclosures by loan origination year, indicating a focus on enhanced transparency and regulatory alignment in credit loss reporting.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley each quantify their exposure to the FDIC special assessment tied to losses from Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures, and what does this reveal about the relative financial impact on their liquidity and capital planning?",
      "answer": "Bank of America disclosed an accrued liability of $1.7 billion for its estimated share of the FDIC special assessment as of December 31, 2024, down from $2.1 billion in 2023, indicating a moderate reduction in expected liability. JPMorgan Chase reported a $725 million increase in the FDIC special assessment in Q1 2024 due to a revised FDIC estimate, and had previously recorded a $2.9 billion charge in Q4 2023, showing a significant and evolving impact on its expense base. Morgan Stanley disclosed a prior-year FDIC special assessment of $286 million, which contributed to a higher expense efficiency ratio in 2023, highlighting a smaller but still material impact compared to the larger banks. Collectively, this shows that while all three institutions are exposed to the same regulatory cost, the magnitude and trajectory of the liability differ, with JPMorgan bearing the largest disclosed burden and Morgan Stanley the smallest, suggesting varying degrees of capital allocation pressure and sensitivity to regulatory developments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Unresolved Repurchase Claims\n\nUnresolved  representations  and  warranties  repurchase  claims  represent  the notional  amount  of  repurchase  claims  made  by  counterparties,  typically  the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments.\n\nThe notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $2.1 billion and $5.4 billion. These balances included $837 million and $2.2 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023 of claims related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation  owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will otherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims paid.\n\nDuring 202 4, the Corporation received $181 million in new repurchase claims that were not time-barred. During 2024, $3.5 billion in claims were resolved.\n\n## Reserve and Related Provision\n\nThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $184 million and $604 million at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023 and  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  liabilities  on  the  Consolidated Balance  Sheet,  and  the  related  provision  is  included  in  other  income  in  the Consolidated  Statement  of  Income.  The  representations  and  warranties  reserve represents the Corporation's best estimate of probable incurred losses, is based on its  experience  in  previous  negotiations,  and  is  subject  to  jud gment,  a  variety  of assumptions and known or unknown uncertainties. At December 3 1, 202 4, the estimated  range  of  possible  loss  in  excess  of  the  accrued  representations  and warranties  reserve  was  not  significant.  F uture  representations  and  warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity.\n\n## Other Contingencies\n\nIn 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule to impose a special assessment to recover certain estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance F und (DIF) arising from the closures of Silicon V alley Bank and Signature Bank. The estimated losses will be recovered through quarterly special assessments collected  from  certain  insured  depository  institutions,  including  the  Corporation, and  collection  began  during  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  202 4.  As  of December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023, the Corporation's accrual for its estimated share of the  FDIC  special  assessment  was  $1.7  billion  and  $2.1  billion.  The  Corporation continues to monitor the FDIC's estimated loss to the DIF , which could affect the amount of its accrued liability.\n\n## Litigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants  in  or  parties  to  many  pending  and  threatened  legal,  regulatory  and governmental  actions  and  proceedings.  In  view  of  the  inherent  difficulty  of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve  a  large  number  of  parties,  the  Corporation  generally  cannot  predict  the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.\n\nAs a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters disclosed below , whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish  an  accrued  liability  and  record  a  corresponding  amount  of  litigationrelated  expense.  The  Corporation  continues  to  monitor  the  matter  for  further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously  established.  Excluding  expenses  of  internal  and  external  legal  service providers,  litigation  and   regulatory  investigation-related   expense  of  $266  million, $519  million  and  $1.2  billion  was  recognized  in  2024,  2023  and  2022, respectively.\n\nFor  any  matter  disclosed  in  this  Note  for  which  a  loss  in  future  period s  is reasonably  possible  and  estimable  (whether  in  excess  of  an  accrued  liability  or where there is no accrued liability), the Corporation's estimated range of possible loss  is  $0  to  $0.8  billion  in  excess  of  the  accrued  liability ,  if  any ,  as  of December 31, 2024.",

      "answer": "AXP reports a total interest expense of $8,252 million on $186,224 million in total interest-bearing liabilities in 2024, reflecting an average rate of 4.4%. In contrast, MS incurs $12,268 million in interest expense on $861,793 million in interest-bearing liabilities, with an average rate of 1.4% in 2024. SCHW shows a more moderate approach, with $6,391 million in interest expense on $392,841 million in interest-bearing liabilities, yielding an average rate of 1.62% in 2024. These figures indicate that AXP bears significantly higher funding costs compared to MS and SCHW, likely due to a greater reliance on higher-yielding long-term debt and customer deposits with elevated average rates. MS benefits from a diversified and lower-cost funding base, particularly through deposits and U.S. repurchase agreements.

PYPL discloses no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2023, but notes potential indemnification obligations tied to $2.2 billion in sold consumer installment receivables, which it does not view as representative of expected exposure.

The SCB is determined based on stress test results and planned dividends, and AXP must comply as a Category III firm. COF also faces a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, but it emphasizes its compliance with the Basel III Capital Rules, including the optional exclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from regulatory capital and the CECL Transition Election, which allowed a phased-in impact on capital through 2024. JPM, as a larger institution, reports a CET1 capital ratio of 15.0% under the Basel III standardized approach and 15.0% under the advanced approach, indicating a robust capital position well above regulatory minimums and a more advanced implementation of Basel III requirements. These differences highlight how each firm navigates CET1 capital ratio requirements based on size, stress testing frameworks, and regulatory classifications.",

We report our capital adequacy ratios using riskweighted assets calculated under the standardized approach. Category III firms such as the Company are not subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements, whereas Category II firms are subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements under current capital rules, which introduce additional complexities in the methodologies used to calculate risk-weighted assets for purposes of determining capital adequacy ratios.\n\nOn July 27, 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would significantly revise U.S. regulatory capital requirements for large banking organizations, including the Company and AENB. The proposed rules would apply a new expanded risk-based approach to calculating risk-based capital ratios, and large banking organizations would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both (i) the standardized approach and (ii) the expanded risk-based approach and use the lower of the two ratio calculations to determine binding capital constraints under each risk-based capital ratio. The expanded risk-based approach to calculating risk-weighted assets would apply more granular risk-weighting methodologies for credit risk, include a new standardized methodology for operational risk, include new approaches for calculating market and credit valuation adjustment risk and revise the treatment of equity exposures not subject to market risk capital requirements. The new approach to calculating market risk also would apply to calculations under the standardized approach. The methodology for operational risk would include differential treatment of fee and other non-interest revenues as compared to interest income for purposes of determining operational risk-weighted assets. The proposed rules would also include additional credit risk capital requirements for certain 'unconditionally cancellable commitments' such as unused portions of committed lines of credit (e.g., credit cards) and would create a proxy methodology to assign capital requirements to credit exposure on products that carry no pre-set spending limits such as charge cards. The Federal Reserve has issued public statements indicating that it intends to work with other U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies on a revised proposal; however, any future rulemaking with respect to Basel III standards remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of any such rulemaking will depend on a number of factors, including the content of the final rulemaking, future minimum regulatory requirements and management decisions regarding our product constructs, capital distributions and target capital levels, and such rulemaking could result in significantly higher regulatory capital requirements for the Company and AENB.\n\nThe Company and AENB must each maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of at least 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively. On top of these minimum capital ratios, the Company is subject to a dynamic stress capital buffer (SCB) composed entirely of CET1 capital with a floor of 2.5 percent and AENB is subject to a static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer (CCB). The SCB equals (i) the difference between a bank holding company's starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario under the Federal Reserve's stress tests described below, plus (ii) one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. As a Category III firm, the required minimum capital ratios for the Company may be further increased by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, if enacted by the Federal Reserve, which must be held in the form of CET1 capital. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero percent; however it could change in the future. If the Federal Reserve were to raise the countercyclical capital buffer, covered banking organizations such as the Company would generally have 12 months after the announcement of such increase to meet the increased buffer requirement, unless the Federal Reserve sets an earlier effective date.\n\nOn August 28, 2024, the Federal Reserve confirmed the SCB for the Company of 2.5 percent, which remained unchanged from the level announced in July 2023. As a result, the effective minimum ratios for the Company (taking into account the SCB requirement) and AENB (taking into account the CCB requirement) are 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent for the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, respectively. Banking organizations with ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital or Total capital to risk-weighted assets below these effective minimum ratios face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends, repurchases and redemptions of capital securities and executive compensation. A bank holding company's SCB requirement is effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect through September 30 of the following year unless it is reset in connection with resubmission of a capital plan, as discussed below.\n\nThe Company is also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization's Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). The Company is also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio, which is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to an ex panded concept of leverage ex posure that takes into account both on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. All banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent, and Category III banking organizations such as the Company are required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0 percent.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NOTE 12-REGULATORY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n\n## Regulation and Capital Adequacy\n\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Board of G overnors of the Federal Reserve System ('Federal Reserve') and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ('OCC'), respectively (the 'Basel III Capital Rules'). The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('Basel Committee'), along with certain provisions of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ('Dodd-Frank Act') and other capital provisions.\n\nAs a bank holding company ('BHC') with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion but less than $700 billion and not exceeding any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, the Company is a Category III institution under the Basel III Capital Rules.\n\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III institution, is a Category III bank. Moreover, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is subject to prompt corrective action ('PCA') capital regulations.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 ('CET1') capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. In addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer requirement and countercyclical capital buffer requirement, each as described in 'Part I-Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital and Stress Testing Regulation-Stress Capital Buffer Rule.' Our capital and leverage ratios are calculated based on the Basel III standardized approach framework.\n\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution. For information on the recognition of AOCI in regulatory capital under the proposed changes to the Basel III Capital Rules, see 'Part I-Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital and Stress Testing Regulation-Basel III Finalization Proposal.'\n\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') (collectively, 'Federal Banking Agencies') adopted a final rule ('CECL Transition Rule') that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the CECL standard on their regulatory capital (the 'CECL Transition Election'). We adopted the CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition Election (for regulatory capital purposes) in the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts presented in this Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a banking institution could elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For the 'day 2' ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years, the Federal Banking Agencies used a uniform 'scaling factor' of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax  'day 1' CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard. From January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, the after-tax 'day 1' CECL adoption impact and the cumulative 'day 2' ongoing impact were being phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.\n\nCapital Impact Delayed\n\nPhase In Period\n\n",

      "answer": "Citigroup reported $14 billion in 'Cash and due from banks' as of the end of 2024, a relatively small portion of its overall liquidity position. Goldman Sachs held $5.36 billion in 'Cash and due from banks' as of December 2024, within a broader cash and cash equivalents category totaling $176.73 billion, and also segregated $14.84 billion for regulatory and client purposes. JPMorgan Chase disclosed $1.4 billion in 'Cash and due from banks' as of both December 31, 2024, and 2023, with additional restricted assets including $40.7 billion in cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for customers.

Third-party research costs incurred by the firm in connection with such arrangements are presented net within commissions and fees.\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRemaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to perform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The firm's remaining performance obligations are generally related to  its  financial  advisory  assignments  and  certain  investment  management activities.  Revenues  associated  with  remaining  performance  obligations relating  to  financial  advisory  assignments  cannot  be  determined  until  the outcome  of  the  transaction.  For  the  firm's  investment  management activities,  where  fees  are  calculated  based  on  the  NA V  of  the  fund  or separately managed account, future revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account.\n\nThe  firm is able to determine the future revenues  associated  with management fees calculated based on committed capital. As of December 2024, substantially all future net revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations will be recognized through 2033. Annual revenues associated with such performance obligations average less than $300 million through 2033.\n\n## Transfers of Financial Assets\n\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers of financial assets  accounted  for  as  sales,  any  gains  or  losses  are  recognized  in  net revenues.  Assets or liabilities that arise from  the firm's continuing involvement with transferred financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. For transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for as sales, the  assets  are  generally  included  in  trading  assets  and  the  transfer  is accounted  for  as  a  collateralized financing,  with  the  related interest expense  recognized  over  the  life  of  the  transaction.  See  Note  11  for further  information  about  transfers  of  financial  assets  accounted  for  as collateralized financings and Note 16 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight deposits held in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  included cash and due from banks of $5.36 billion as of December 2024 and $7.93 billion  as  of  December  2023.  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  also  included interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  of  $176.73  billion  as  of  December 2024 and $233.65 billion as of December 2023.\n\nThe  firm  segregates  cash  for  regulatory  and  other  purposes  related  to client  activity.  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  segregated  for  regulatory  and other  purposes  were  $14.84  billion  as  of  December  2024  and  $17.08 billion as of December 2023. In addition, the firm segregates securities for regulatory  and  other  purposes  related  to  client  activity.  See  Note  11  for further information about segregated securities.\n\n## Customer and Other Receivables\n\nCustomer and other receivables included receivables from customers and counterparties of $92.88 billion as of December 2024 and $90.16 billion as of  December  2023,  and  receivables  from  brokers,  dealers  and  clearing organizations of $40.84 billion as of December 2024 and $42.33 billion as of December  2023.  Such  receivables  primarily  consist  of  customer margin  loans, collateral posted  in connection  with  certain derivative transactions, and receivables resulting from unsettled transactions.\n\nSubstantially  all  of  these  receivables  are  accounted  for  at  amortized  cost net of any allowance for credit losses, which generally approximates fair value. As these receivables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included  in  the  firm's  fair  value  hierarchy  in  Notes  4  and  5.  Had  these receivables  been  included  in  the  firm's  fair  value  hierarchy,  substantially all  would  have  been  classified  in  level  2  as  of  both  December  2024  and December 2023. See Note 10 for further information about customer and other  receivables  accounted  for  at  fair  value  under  the  fair  value  option. Interest  on  customer  and  other  receivables  is  recognized  over  the  life  of the transaction and included in interest income.\n\nCustomer and other receivables includes receivables from contracts with clients  and  contract  assets.  Contract  assets  represent  the  firm's  right  to receive consideration for services provided in connection with its contracts  with  clients  for  which  collection  is  conditional  and  not  merely subject to the passage of time. The firm's receivables from contracts with clients  were  $4.08  billion  as  of  December  2024  and  $3.59  billion  as  of December  2023.  As  of  both  December  2024  and  December  2023, contract assets were not material.",

('Parent Company') and certain of its affiliates unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans prov ided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectiv ely referred to as 'cov ered transactions'), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Gov ernment debt obligations, cov ered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary's total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary's total capital.\n\nThe Parent Company's two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the 'IHC'). The IHC generally holds the stock of JPMorganChase's subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and prov ides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds receiv ed from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).\n\nThe principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are div idends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and div idends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to div idend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserv e, the OCC and the FDIC hav e authority under the Financial Institutions Superv isory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of div idends by the banking organizations they superv ise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a div idend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying div idends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity 'thresholds' are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company's management or Board of Directors.\n\nAt January 1, 2025, the Parent Company's banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $15.5 billion in div idends to their respectiv e bank holding companies without the prior approv al of their relev ant banking regulators. The capacity to pay div idends in 2025 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries' earnings during the year.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley differ in their reporting and strategic emphasis on asset management fees, and what does this reveal about their respective positioning in the wealth management market?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reports a significant increase in asset management fees, rising from $12,002 million in 2023 to $13,875 million in 2024, indicating strong growth in its wealth management business. JPMorgan Chase highlights that its asset management fees are primarily earned through its Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) division and Consumer & Community Banking (CCB), suggesting a dual-channel strategy to capture both institutional and retail clients. Morgan Stanley emphasizes a structured revenue recognition model for asset management fees, based on asset levels under management (AUM), and ties fee recognition directly to performance and service delivery, reinforcing its client-centric and performance-based approach. Together, these disclosures reveal that while all three firms prioritize asset management, they differ in growth trajectory, client segmentation, and revenue recognition methodology.",

Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Presentation Changes in 2024\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Firm implemented certain presentation changes which resulted in a decrease to both interest income and interest expense of $4,432  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  and  no  effect  on  net interest  income,  with  the  entire  impact  to  the  Firm  recorded  within  the Institutional Securities segment. These changes further aligned the accounting  treatment  between  the  balance  sheet  and  the  related  interest income  or  ex pense,  primarily  by  offsetting  interest  income  and  ex pense  for certain  prime  brokerage-related  customer  receivables  and  payables  that  are currently accounted for as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The current  and  previous  presentation  of  these  interest  income  and  interest expense amounts are acceptable and the change does not represent a change in  accounting  principle.  These  changes  were  applied  retrospectively  to  the consolidated income statement for 2023 and accordingly, 2023 amounts were adjusted to conform with the current presentation.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when the promised goods or services are delivered to  our  customers in an amount that is based on the consideration the  Firm expects  to  receive  in  ex change  for  those  goods  or  services  when  such amounts are not probable of significant reversal.\n\n## Investment Banking\n\nRevenues from investment banking activities consist of revenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fix ed income securities and loan syndications,  and  advisory  fees,  primarily  for  mergers,  acquisitions  and restructurings.\n\nUnderwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty  or  contingency  related  to  the  amount  to  be  paid.  Underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related underwriting revenues are recorded.\n\nAdvisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated  progress  of  work  and  when  revenues  are  not  probable  of  a significant reversal. Advisory costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items, including those reimbursed.\n\n## Commissions and Fees\n\nCommission and fee revenues generally result from transaction-based arrangements  in  which  the  client  is  charged  a  fee  for  the  ex ecution  of transactions. Such  revenues  primarily  arise  from  transactions  in  equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and options, as well as revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to brokerdealers,  ex changes  and  market  centers  for  ex ecution.  Commission  and  fee revenues  are  recognized  on  trade  date  when  the  performance  obligation  is satisfied.\n\n## Asset Management Revenues\n\nAsset management, distribution and administration fees are generally based on related asset levels, such as the AUM of a customer's account or the net asset value of a fund. These fees are generally recognized when services are performed and the value of the assets is known. Management fees are reduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, provided to the customer.\n\nPerformance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are recorded when the annual performance target is met and the revenues are not probable of a significant reversal.\n\nSales  commissions  paid  by  the  Firm  in  connection  with  the  sale  of  certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred  commission  assets  and  amortized  to  Other  expenses  over  the expected life of the contract. The Firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods.  Other  asset  management  and  distribution  costs  are  recognized  as incurred in the relevant non-interest ex penses line items.",

      "question": "How do Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley differ in their recognition timing and structure of advisory fees within investment banking revenue, and what does this reveal about their client engagement models?",
      "answer": "Goldman Sachs discloses that it receives advisory fees from affiliated funds and recognizes them in conjunction with its role as investment manager, indicating a close alignment with fund-based advisory relationships. JPMorgan Chase recognizes advisory fees as revenue 'typically upon execution of the client's transaction,' suggesting a transactional, deal-completion model. Morgan Stanley recognizes advisory fees 'as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated progress of work,' which implies a more progressive and milestone-based revenue recognition tied to advisory engagement. These differences suggest that GS focuses on fund-linked advisory services, JPM emphasizes deal-execution triggers, and MS adopts a continuous advisory model.",

        "Hop 1: GS \u2192 Advisory Fees: GS receives advisory fees from affiliated funds and is entitled to them as the investment manager, indicating a fund-linked advisory model.",

The related contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliv er future serv ices. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliv er serv ices in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future ev ents or underlying asset v alues, and is not recognized until the outcome of those ev ents or v alues are known.\n\n## Investment banking fees\n\nThis rev enue category includes debt and equity underwriting and adv isory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital v ia public offering and priv ate placement of v arious types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as rev enue typically upon execution of the client's transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as rev enue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria.\n\nThe Firm also prov ides adv isory serv ices by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, div estitures, restructuring and other complex transactions.

Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Presentation Changes in 2024\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Firm implemented certain presentation changes which resulted in a decrease to both interest income and interest expense of $4,432  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  and  no  effect  on  net interest  income,  with  the  entire  impact  to  the  Firm  recorded  within  the Institutional Securities segment. These changes further aligned the accounting  treatment  between  the  balance  sheet  and  the  related  interest income  or  ex pense,  primarily  by  offsetting  interest  income  and  ex pense  for certain  prime  brokerage-related  customer  receivables  and  payables  that  are currently accounted for as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The current  and  previous  presentation  of  these  interest  income  and  interest expense amounts are acceptable and the change does not represent a change in  accounting  principle.  These  changes  were  applied  retrospectively  to  the consolidated income statement for 2023 and accordingly, 2023 amounts were adjusted to conform with the current presentation.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when the promised goods or services are delivered to  our  customers in an amount that is based on the consideration the  Firm expects  to  receive  in  ex change  for  those  goods  or  services  when  such amounts are not probable of significant reversal.\n\n## Investment Banking\n\nRevenues from investment banking activities consist of revenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fix ed income securities and loan syndications,  and  advisory  fees,  primarily  for  mergers,  acquisitions  and restructurings.\n\nUnderwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty  or  contingency  related  to  the  amount  to  be  paid.  Underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related underwriting revenues are recorded.\n\nAdvisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated  progress  of  work  and  when  revenues  are  not  probable  of  a significant reversal. Advisory costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items, including those reimbursed.\n\n## Commissions and Fees\n\nCommission and fee revenues generally result from transaction-based arrangements  in  which  the  client  is  charged  a  fee  for  the  ex ecution  of transactions. Such  revenues  primarily  arise  from  transactions  in  equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and options, as well as revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to brokerdealers,  ex changes  and  market  centers  for  ex ecution.

      "question": "How do American Express, Capital One, and Morgan Stanley compare in their Tier 1 Leverage ratios as of December 2024, and what does this reveal about their respective capital adequacy and risk profiles in the context of regulatory minimums?",
      "answer": "As of December 2024, American Express Company reported a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 9.8%, Capital One Financial Corp reported 11.6%, and Morgan Stanley reported 7.7%. All three firms exceed the regulatory minimum of 4.0%, but Capital One demonstrates the strongest leverage position, followed by American Express, while Morgan Stanley maintains a lower buffer above the minimum. This suggests differing capital strategies and risk tolerances among the firms.",

        "Hop 1: AXP \u2192 Tier 1 Leverage: American Express Company disclosed a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 9.8% as of December 2024, well above the 4.0% regulatory minimum.",
        "Hop 2: COF \u2192 Tier 1 Leverage: Capital One Financial Corp reported a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 11.6% as of December 2024, significantly exceeding the 4.0% minimum requirement.",
        "Hop 3: MS \u2192 Tier 1 Leverage: Morgan Stanley disclosed a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 7.7% as of December 2024, which is above the 4.0% regulatory minimum but the lowest among the three firms."

JPMorgan provides specific standardized and advanced capital ratio requirements, showing a structured and regulatory-focused perspective on capital adequacy.

      "question": "How do BlackRock (BLK), Mastercard (MA), and Charles Schwab (SCHW) each adjust their Diluted EPS, and what do these adjustments reveal about their differing approaches to non-GAAP reporting and earnings normalization?",
      "answer": "BlackRock reports both GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS figures, showing $36.51 (GAAP) and $37.77 (adjusted) for 2023, indicating a relatively modest upward adjustment. Mastercard adjusts its diluted EPS downward from $8.76 (GAAP) to $8.40 (adjusted), primarily due to (gains) losses on equity investments and litigation provisions. Charles Schwab significantly increases its diluted EPS from $2.54 (GAAP) to $3.13 (adjusted), reflecting larger adjustments related to acquisition and integration costs, restructuring, and amortization. These differences reveal that while all three firms use non-GAAP adjustments, they apply them with varying intensity and focus, depending on their business activities and strategic events.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BLK \u2192 Adjusted Diluted EPS: BlackRock reports $36.51 diluted EPS on a GAAP basis and $37.77 on an adjusted basis in 2023, showing a small upward adjustment primarily due to operating and tax adjustments.",
        "Hop 2: MA \u2192 Adjusted Diluted EPS: Mastercard reports $8.76 diluted EPS on a GAAP basis and adjusts it down to $8.40, mainly due to (gains) losses on equity investments and litigation provisions, indicating downward pressures on earnings.",
        "Hop 3: SCHW \u2192 Adjusted Diluted EPS: Charles Schwab reports $2.54 diluted EPS on a GAAP basis and adjusts it upward to $3.13, driven by significant adjustments for acquisition, restructuring, and amortization costs, showing a more aggressive normalization approach."

      "answer": "AXP discloses that investment income on liquidity resources (e.g., U.S. Government Treasury obligations) is less than the interest expense on funding sources, resulting in net interest costs that were substantial in 2021. MET indicates that low interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce investment income, increase liabilities, and compress profit margins, highlighting sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. V reports investment income (expense) as a non-operating line item in its consolidated statements of operations, though specific figures are not provided. Together, these perspectives show that AXP focuses on liquidity management with an emphasis on the cost-yield mismatch, MET emphasizes interest rate risk and spread compression, and V treats investment income as a non-operating component, suggesting a more transactional or secondary role in its financial performance. This reveals differing strategic priorities: AXP prioritizes liquidity buffer adequacy despite negative spreads, MET actively manages interest rate exposure due to product sensitivity, and V appears to treat investment income as a peripheral financial element.",

We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.\n\nOur liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:\n\n- Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the 'Funding Strategy' section for more details);\n- Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;\n- Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; and\n- Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve's discount window.\n\nThe amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements.\n\nWe believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $24.6 billion in Cash and cash equivalents and Investment securities (which are substantially comprised of U.S. Government Treasury obligations). The decrease of $30.0 billion from $54.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the increase in the balances of our Card Member loans and receivables, debt maturities, share repurchases and a reduction in customer deposits, partially offset by the issuance of unsecured and secured debt securities.\n\nThe investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. In 2021, the net interest costs to maintain these resources were substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Public Health Risks\n\nPandemics and other public health issues, and governmental, business, and consumer reactions to them, have affected and may continue to affect economic conditions. They have and may continue to cause illnesses and deaths, changes in consumer or business  confidence,  behavior  and  activity,  changes  to  interest  rates  and  other  market  risk  factors,  and  governmental  or  other restrictions on economic activity for prolonged periods. Any of these issues may cause or exacerbate any of the difficult economic conditions we describe in these risk factors.\n\n## Interest Rate Risks\n\nSome of our products and investments expose us to interest rate risks, including changes in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, which may reduce or eliminate our investment spread and net income.\n\nLow interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or sustained low market returns, we may incur significant losses due to, among other  reasons,  losses  incurred  in  our  general  account  and  the  impact  of  guarantees,  including  increases  in  liabilities,  capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, during periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative.\n\nLower spreads may accelerate the amortization of DAC, reducing net income and in turn, harming our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition. During periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to increase our reserves.\n\nInterest rate increases may also harm our profitability. During rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates required to stay competitive. This could result in a lower spread, lower profitability, decreased sales, and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived  returns.  This  may  result  in  cash  outflows  requiring  the  sale  of  investments  on  less  favorable  terms,  resulting  in investment losses. We may accelerate the amortization of DAC and value of business acquired ('VOBA'), reducing net income, harming our credit  instrument  covenants  and  rating  agency  assessment  of  our  financial  condition.  Interest  rate  increases  may harm the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair value of fixed income securities, and may increase our daily settlement payments on interest rate futures and cleared swaps, resulting in increased cash outflows and liquidity  needs.  Furthermore,  if  interest  rates  rise,  our  unrealized  gains  on  fixed  income  securities  may  decrease  and  our unrealized  losses  may  increase.  We  would  recognize  the  accumulated  change  in  estimated  fair  value  of  these  fixed  income securities in net income when we realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the security or we determine that the decline in estimated fair value is due to a credit loss. Finally, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.\n\nFederal Reserve Board monetary policy (and that of other central banks) may also impact the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may harm our investment income or product sales.\n\nThe measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities, may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, we may  not  be  able  to  invest  assets  at  the  full  liability  duration,  thereby  creating  some  asset/liability  mismatch.  In  addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders' equity because we record our non-qualified derivatives at fair value through earnings, while the related hedged items either follow an accrual-based accounting model or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.",

JPMorgan Chase defines adjusted average assets for leverage ratios similarly, emphasizing the impact of Tier 1 capital deductions and the CECL transition provisions. MetLife, on the other hand, uses leverage ratios as a target benchmark within its free cash flow framework, focusing on capital contributions and debt utilization to maintain financial flexibility.

      "question": "How do Citigroup (C), Capital One (COF), and Charles Schwab (SCHW) each report the weighted-average yield across their debt securities, and what does this reveal about their respective investment strategies in high-yield versus government-backed instruments?",
      "answer": "Citigroup reports a weighted-average yield of 2.38% across its total debt securities held-to-maturity, with particularly high yields in foreign government securities (9.86%) and other debt instruments (6.01%). Capital One reports a higher overall weighted-average yield of 3.69% on its available-for-sale securities, with yields increasing in longer-duration instruments, particularly in RMBS (3.72%) and CMBS (4.05%). Charles Schwab does not provide specific yield numbers but notes that the weighted-average yield is calculated using amortized cost, and it excludes certain hedge adjustments. Together, these disclosures suggest Citigroup has a more diversified but lower-yield portfolio, Capital One leans into higher-yielding structured products, and Schwab's methodology implies a more conservative or hedged approach to yield calculation.",

        "Hop 1: C \u2192 Weighted-Average Yield: Citigroup reports a 2.38% weighted-average yield on its total debt securities, with higher yields in foreign government (9.86%) and 'all other' (6.01%) categories.",

BAC applies historical loss experience as part of a broader loss forecasting framework that includes macroeconomic scenarios such as unemployment rates and GDP levels, and does not record allowances for credit losses on credit cards unless there is a contractual maturity. MET incorporates several decades of historical default and loss severity data, segmented by internal risk ratings, and applies forecasted economic assumptions over a two-year period for commercial mortgages before reverting to historical loss experience.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for ex ternal purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Reserves for Credit Losses on Card Member Loans\n\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans represent management's estimate of the expected credit losses in the Company's outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2024. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&amp;S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As disclosed by management, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company's reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&amp;S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss ex perience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for ex pected credit losses. Within the R&amp;S Period, the Company's models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&amp;S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs, qualitative reserves, and significant assumptions, including the R&amp;S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&amp;S Period and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.",

          "chunk_text": "which  case,  the  allowance  recorded  is  limited  to  the  difference  between  the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset.\n\nThe  Corporation  separately  evaluates  its  HTM  debt  securities  for  any  credit losses,  of  which  substantially  all  qualify  for  th e  zero  loss  assumption.  For  th e remaining securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses.\n\nInterest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or  accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales or dispositions of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\nEquity  securities  with  readily  determinable  fair  values  that  are  not  held  for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost less impairment, if any , plus or minus qualifying observable price changes. These securities are reported in other assets.\n\n## Loans and Leases\n\nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are reported  at  their  outstanding  principal  balances  net  of  any  unearned  income, charge-offs,  unamortized  deferred  fees  and  costs  on  originated  loans,  and  for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized  as adjustments  to  interest  income  over  the  lives  of  the  related  loans.  Unearned income,  discounts  and  premiums  are  amortized  to  interest  income  using  a constant effective yield methodology . The Corporation elects to account for certain consumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or oth er income.\n\nUnder  applicable  accounting  guidance,  for  reporting  purposes,  the  loan  and lease  portfolio  is  categorized  by  portfolio  segment  and,  within  each  portfolio segment, by class of financing receivable. A portfolio segment is defined as the level  at  wh ich   a n  entity  d evelop s  a nd   d ocuments  a  systematic  meth od ology  to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing receivable is defined  as  the  level  of  d isaggregation  of  portfolio  segments  based  on  th e  initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation's three portfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity . The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment are credit card, direct/indirect consumer  and  other  consumer.  The  classes  within  the  Commercial  portfolio segment  are  U.S.  commercial,  non-U.S.  commercial,  commercial  real  estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business commercial.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate  the  interest  method.  Operating  lease  income  is  recognized  on  a straight-line basis. The Corporation's lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe ECL on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contra-asset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit  (SBLCs)  and  binding  unfunded  loan  commitments  is  reported  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for  credit  losses  related  to  th e  loan  and   lease  portfolio  and   unfund ed   lend ing commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the current estimate of ECL.\n\nFor loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated using quantitative methods that  consider  a  variety  of  factors  such   as  h istorical  loss  exp erience,  th e  current credit quality of th e portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of  the  loan  adjusted  for  any  expected  prepayments.  The  contractual  maturity includes any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open- ended products (e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines unless those  lines  of  cred it  are  uncond itionally  cancellab le  (e.g.,  cred it  card s)  in  wh ich case the Corporation does not record any allowance.\n\nIn its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward-looking information  through  the  use  of  macroeconomic  scenarios  applied  over  the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends.\n\nThe  estimate  of  credit  losses  includes  expected  recoveries  of  amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan has been charged off, the expected  cash  flows  on  the  loan  are  not  limited  by  th e  current  amortized  cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off.\n\nIncluded in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately  reflected  in  the  quantitative  methods  or  the  economic  assumptions described  above.  For  example,  factors  that  the  Corporation  considers  include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data.\n\nWith the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable",

Investments (continued)\n\n## Commercial and Agricultural Mortgage Loan Portfolio Segments\n\nWithin each loan portfolio segment, commercial and agricultural loans are pooled by internal risk rating. Estimated lifetime loss rates, which vary by internal risk rating, are applied to the amortized cost of each loan, ex cluding accrued investment income, on a quarterly basis to develop the ACL. Internal risk ratings are based on an assessment of the loan's credit quality, which can change over time. The estimated lifetime loss rates are based on several loan portfolio segment-specific factors, including (i) the Company's experience with defaults and loss severity, (ii) expected default and loss severity over the forecast period, (iii) current and forecasted economic conditions including growth, inflation, interest rates and unemployment levels, (iv) loan specific characteristics including loan-to-value ('L TV ') ratios, and (v) internal risk ratings. These evaluations are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. The Company uses its several decades of historical default and loss severity experience which capture multiple economic cycles. The Company uses a forecast of economic assumptions for a two-year period for most of its commercial and agricultural mortgage loans, while a one-year period is used for such loans originated in certain markets. After the applicable forecast period, the Company reverts to its historical loss experience using a straight-line basis over two years. For evaluations of commercial mortgage loans, in addition to historical experience, management considers factors that include the impact of a rapid change to the economy, which may not be reflected in the loan portfolio, recent loss and recovery trend experience as compared to historical loss and recovery experience, and loan specific characteristics including debt service coverage ratios ('DSCR'). In estimating expected lifetime credit loss over the term of its commercial mortgage loans, the Company adjusts for expected prepayment and extension experience during the forecast period using historical prepayment and extension experience considering the expected position in the economic cycle and the loan profile (i.e., floating rate, shorter-term fix ed rate and longer-term fix ed rate) and after the forecast period using long-term historical prepayment ex perience. For evaluations of agricultural mortgage loans, in addition to historical ex perience, management considers factors that include increased stress in certain sectors, which may be evidenced by higher delinquency rates,  or  a  change  in  the  number  of  higher  risk  loans.  In  estimating  ex pected  lifetime  credit  loss  over  the  term  of  its  agricultural  mortgage  loans,  the  Company's experience is much less sensitive to the position in the economic cycle and by loan profile; accordingly, historical prepayment experience is used, while extension terms are not prevalent with the Company's agricultural mortgage loans.\n\nCommercial mortgage loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis, which review includes, but is not limited to, an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, L TV  ratios, DSCR and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher L TV ratios  and  lower  DSCR. Agricultural mortgage loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis, which review includes, but is not limited to, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, L TV  ratios and borrower creditworthiness, as well as reviews on a geographic and property-type basis. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans also focuses on higher risk loans.\n\nFor commercial mortgage loans, the primary credit quality indicator is the DSCR, which compares a property's net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. G enerally, the lower the DSCR, the higher the risk of ex periencing a credit loss. The Company also reviews the L TV  ratio of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio. L TV  ratios compare the unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. G enerally, the higher the L TV  ratio, the higher the risk of ex periencing a credit loss. The DSCR and the values utilized in calculating the ratio are updated routinely. In addition, the LTV ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of the Company's ongoing review of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio.\n\nFor agricultural mortgage loans, the  Company's primary credit quality indicator is the  L TV  ratio.  The values utilized in calculating this ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural mortgage loan portfolio and are routinely updated.\n\nAfter commercial and agricultural mortgage loans are approved, the Company makes commitments to lend and, typically, borrowers draw down on some or all of the commitments. The timing of mortgage loan funding is based on the commitment expiration dates. A liability for credit loss for unfunded commercial and agricultural mortgage loan commitments that is not unconditionally cancellable is recognized in earnings and is reported within net investment gains (losses). The liability is based on estimated lifetime loss rates as described above and the amount of the outstanding commitments, which for lines of credit, considers estimated utilization rates. When the commitment is funded or expires, the liability is adjusted accordingly.",

      "answer": "Bank of America reports net derivative liabilities of $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, with a breakdown of derivative assets at $3.6 billion and liabilities at $5.5 billion, indicating active market-making and derivative-related income activities. MetLife provides a qualitative view by referencing the fair value of net derivative assets and liabilities after netting agreements and collateral, suggesting a focus on counterparty risk and structured risk mitigation. Morgan Stanley discloses net derivative liabilities with credit risk-related contingent features at $22.414 billion for 2024, significantly higher than BAC, and shows collateral posted at $16.252 billion, reflecting a larger and more complex derivatives book tied to credit-sensitive instruments. Together, these disclosures highlight BAC's moderate exposure in trading activities, MET's structured and collateralized risk approach, and MS's significant credit-linked derivative liabilities requiring substantial collateral support.",

JPMorgan Chase experienced net inflows that positively impacted asset management fees, driven by higher average market levels and performance fees, particularly in its AWM and CCB segments. Charles Schwab reported net outflows of $14.6 billion from off-platform brokered CDs and mixed flows from international relationships, suggesting client fund reallocation pressures.

The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net rev enue basis.\n\nThe increase in CIB was partially offset by a net decrease in Corporate, reflecting lower rev enue in Treasury and CIO, and gains compared with a net loss on certain legacy priv ate equity inv estments in the prior year. Refer to CIB segment and Corporate results on pages 77-83 and pages 88-90, respectiv ely, and Note 6 for additional information.\n\nLending- and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting, in CIB, higher deposit-related fees, including cash management fees in Payments, on higher v olume; and higher lending-related fees, including loan commitment fees.

Accordingly, am ounts related to the Retirem ent Business Services business unit are included within Investor Services f or f ull-year 2024, and prior-year am ounts have been recast to ref lect this new basis of segm entation.

In 2024 and 2023, Advisor Services includes outf lows of  $0.3 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, f rom  an international relationship. (2)\n\n## Segment Net Revenues\n\nInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 6% in 2024 compared to 2023. Net interest revenue increased for Investor Services primarily due to growth of margin lending and lower average balances of FHLB borrowings, partially offset by lower average interest-earning assets and higher average rates paid on most funding sources. Trading revenue increased for Investor Services due to higher order flow revenue as a result of increased trading volumes and changes in the mix of trading activity. Other revenue increased for Investor Services primarily due to higher industry fees and lower losses recognized on sales of AFS securities. Advisor Services total net revenues decreased by 3% in 2024 compared to 2023. Net interest revenue decreased for Advisor Services primarily as a result of lower average interest-earning assets and higher average rates paid on most funding sources, partially offset by lower average balances of FHLB borrowings, and trading revenue decreased for Advisor Services, primarily due to lower order flow revenue as a result of changes in the mix of client trading activity. Asset management and administration fees increased for both segments, primarily as a result of higher balances in money market funds and Mutual Fund OneSource, and, additionally for Investor Services, fee-based managed investing solutions. Additionally, bank deposit account fees increased for both segments, primarily due to breakage fees incurred that resulted in lower bank deposit account fee revenue in 2023, partially offset by lower BDA balances.\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues decreased by 8% and 15%, respectively, in 2023 compared to 2022. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments due to higher-cost funding sources and lower average interest-earning asset balances, as described above. Both segments saw a decrease in bank deposit account fees due to lower average BDA balances",

      "answer": "BlackRock explicitly reports its book value per share as $306.52 in 2024, showing a clear and direct disclosure of this metric as part of its GAAP financial reporting. Citigroup emphasizes a derived metric, tangible book value per share (TBVPS), which adjusts for goodwill and intangible assets, indicating a focus on more conservative capital adequacy measures. JPMorgan defines book value per share (BVPS) in terms of its calculation methodology\u2014common stockholders' equity divided by common shares outstanding\u2014but does not provide a specific numerical value, suggesting a more procedural rather than quantitative emphasis in its disclosures. These differences highlight varying approaches to capital transparency and financial communication: BlackRock leads with direct metrics, Citigroup with adjusted risk-aware measures, and JPMorgan with definitional clarity over explicit values.",

Goldman Sachs (GS) highlights that savings deposits are part of a diversified funding strategy that reduces reliance on wholesale funding, with deposits sourced from consumers, private bank clients, and institutional clients via GS Bank USA and other entities. Morgan Stanley (MS) notes that savings deposits, along with time deposits, contributed to an increase in total deposits in 2024, sourced primarily from Wealth Management clients and considered stable and low-cost.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Liquidity Regulation\n\nThe Company and AENB are subject to two standards for liquidity risk supervision as implemented by the Federal Reserve and OCC: the minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs for a 30-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario specified by supervisors. The LCR measures the ratio of a firm's high-quality liquid assets to its projected net outflows. The NSFR requires a minimum amount of longer-term funding sources based on the assets, commitments and derivative exposures of banking entities. As a Category III firm with less than $75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, the Company, and its depository institution subsidiary, AENB, are subject to LCR and NSFR requirements at 85 percent of the full requirements. The Company and AENB are required to calculate the LCR and NSFR on a daily basis and the Company is required to make public disclosures related to its LCR on a quarterly basis and NSFR on a semi-annual basis, in each case, subject to applicable transition periods following the Company becoming a Category III firm. Category II firms and their depository institution subsidiaries are subject to the full requirements of the LCR and NSFR, as well as a requirement to submit a liquidity monitoring report on a daily (rather than monthly) basis.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve's enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and risk management requirements. The rule requires the maintenance of a liquidity buffer, consisting of highly liquid assets, that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios. In contrast to the LCR, which is a standardized approach, the liquidity buffer requirement is calculated based on the Company's own models.\n\n## Proposed Long-Term Debt Requirements\n\nOn August 29, 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that, if adopted as proposed, would require covered bank holding companies such as the Company to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible external long-term debt with specific terms for purposes of absorbing losses or recapitalizing the covered bank holding company and its operating subsidiaries. The notice of proposed rulemaking also proposed requiring certain insured depository institutions that have at least $100 billion in consolidated assets, such as AENB, to maintain minimum amounts of eligible internal long-term debt for purposes of absorbing losses or recapitalizing the insured depository institution.\n\n## Stress Testing and Capital Planning\n\nUnder the Federal Reserve's regulations, the Company is subject to annual supervisory stress testing requirements and biennial company-run stress testing requirements (commonly referred to as Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests or 'DFASTs') that are designed to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions.\n\nAs part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve uses pro-forma capital positions and ratios under such stress scenarios to determine the size of the SCB for each CCAR participating firm. As a Category III firm, the Company is required to develop and submit to the Federal Reserve an annual capital plan and stress testing results on or before April 5 of each year.\n\nThe Company may be required to revise and resubmit its capital plan following certain events or developments, such as a significant acquisition or an event that could result in a material change in its risk profile or financial condition. If the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan, it must receive prior approval from the Federal Reserve for any capital distributions (including common stock dividend payments and share repurchases), other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument.",

Refer to the Firm's U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm's website, for a further discussion of the Firm's LCR.\n\n## Liquidity sources\n\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believ es would be av ailable to raise liquidity. T his includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair v alue of these securities was approximately $594 billion and $649 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prev ailing market conditions. The decrease compared to December 31, 2023, was driv en by reductions in unencumbered AFS securities in Treasury and CIO, excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and unencumbered CIB trading assets.\n\nThe Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of av ailable cash and securities as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. For each respectiv e period, the amount was comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately $834 billion and $798 billion, and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair v alue of approximately $594 billion and $649 billion.\n\nThe Firm also had av ailable borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks ('FHLBs') and the discount window at the Federal Reserv e Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $413 billion and $340 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserv e Banks discount window and other central banks. Av ailable borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a higher amount of commercial loans and credit card receiv ables pledged at the Federal Reserv e Banks. Although av ailable, the Firm does not v iew this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserv e Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.\n\n## NSFR\n\nThe net stable funding ratio ('NSFR') is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of 'av ailable' stable funding that is sufficient to meet their 'required' amounts of stable funding ov er a one-year horizon.\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2024, both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's interpretation of the final NSFR rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report on the Firm's website for additional information.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\nrisk-weighted assets related to de minimis positions, those adjustments have not significantly impacted our risk-based capital ratios nor have they had a current impact on CSC's activities.\n\nThe U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rule is designed to promote resiliency of the banking sector by requiring that certain large U.S. banking organizations (Covered Companies) maintain a liquidity risk profile which ensures that they have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), such as central bank reserves, certain government securities, and eligible corporate debt that can be converted easily and quickly to cash, to survive a significant stress event lasting 30 days. The LCR rule requires Covered Companies, including Schwab, to maintain an amount of HQLA that are unencumbered and controlled by the Covered Company's liquidity management function sufficient to meet a designated percentage of their total stressed net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period, as calculated in accordance with the LCR rule. Schwab is subject to the LCR and public disclosure requirement on a consolidated basis. On a quarterly basis the Company is required to disclose the average daily LCR over the quarter, and the Company also discloses quantitative and qualitative information over certain portions of the Company's LCR components. Under the LCR rule, Schwab is required to maintain HQLA to cover 100% of the total stressed net cash outflows on a daily basis. In addition, HQLA that are held at the Company's bank subsidiaries in excess of the subsidiaries' total net cash outflows, and are not transferable to non-bank affiliates, are excluded by rule from the Company's eligible HQLA.\n\nThe final Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) rule was jointly adopted by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC to strengthen the resilience of large bank and savings and loan holding companies by requiring them to maintain a minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of the holding company's assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon. The requirement is expressed as a ratio of a banking organization's available stable funding (ASF) to its required stable funding (RSF). Under the NSFR rule, CSC and our banking subsidiaries are required to maintain ASF in an amount equal to 100% of its RSF on an ongoing, daily basis. CSC is also required to publicly disclose its quarterly NSFR on a semi-annual basis.\n\n## Capital Stress Testing\n\nUnder the current Federal Reserve capital stress testing rules, savings and loan holding companies that are Category III banking organizations and state member banks with total consolidated assets over $250 billion are required to disclose the results of company-run stress tests in even-numbered years. In the most recent cycle in 2024, CSC and CSB conducted company-run stress tests, reported the results of their stress testing to the Federal Reserve, and published a summary of their stress test results.\n\nPursuant to the Federal Reserve's requirements, Category III savings and loan holding companies are also subject to an annual supervisory stress testing requirement in which the Federal Reserve conducts its own stress testing analysis to evaluate the ability of a holding company to absorb losses in specified economic and financial conditions over a nine-quarter planning horizon using such analytical techniques as the agency determines are appropriate. This supervisory stress testing requirement went into effect for CSC beginning with the 2022 stress testing cycle.\n\nPursuant to the Federal Reserve's requirements, savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, including CSC, are subject to an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, which requires submission of an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve. These requirements also impose a stress capital buffer requirement, floored at 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. In June 2024, the Company received the results of the Federal Reserve's 2024 CCAR. These results included the Federal Reserve's estimate of CSC's minimum capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario for the nine-quarter horizon beginning December 31, 2023 and ending March 31, 2026. Based on these results, CSC's calculated stress capital buffer remains below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a stress capital buffer at the 2.5% floor. This 2.5% stress capital buffer became applicable on October 1, 2024. See Part II - Item 8 - Note 24 for additional information regarding our capital requirements.\n\n## Additional Enhanced Prudential Standards\n\nIn addition to the capital stress testing regime discussed above, the Federal Reserve's enhanced prudential standards rules also extend the applicability of certain additional enhanced prudential standards to large savings and loan holding companies, with the specific requirements tailored based on the same four-category framework utilized in the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules. These additional enhanced prudential standards, applicable to large U.S. bank holding companies under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), include: risk management and risk committee requirements; liquidity risk management, liquidity stress testing, and liquidity buffer requirements; and single",

      "answer": "American Express (AXP) uses Probability of Default (PD) models to estimate the likelihood an account will be written off, integrating PD with Exposure at Default (EAD) and recovery models over a three-year reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period). Capital One (COF) applies PD in conjunction with loss severity estimates to derive total loss expectations for commercial banking loans, with internal risk ratings and management judgment used to adjust these factors. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) incorporates PD as part of its Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) framework for derivatives, estimating expected losses based on counterparty PD and recovery rates, using CDS spreads as a key input. The synthesis reveals that AXP focuses on consumer loan write-offs, COF emphasizes commercial loan risk segmentation and judgmental adjustments, and JPM applies PD in a capital markets context to counterparty credit events, highlighting distinct business models and risk management priorities.",

Citigroup (C) defines 'Other Commitments' under FFIEC guidelines, emphasizing legally binding cross-border commitments and local funding mechanisms, though it does not provide a dollar figure. JPMorgan (JPM) categorizes 'Other Commitments' under Note 28 in its 2024 filing, indicating a structured approach to off-balance sheet risk, though specific figures are not included in the provided evidence. Together, these disclosures suggest that BAC provides granular maturity-based breakdowns, C focuses on regulatory alignment and geographic risk segmentation, and JPM emphasizes structured categorization within its broader off-balance sheet instruments framework.",

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs reported a Total Trading Asset value of $570,555 million as of December 2024, with a significant portion in Trading Cash Instruments ($523,216 million), suggesting a strong emphasis on cash-based trading activities. JPMorgan Chase disclosed $1,429 million in Trading Assets within securitized assets from nonconsolidated VIEs, indicating a more specialized exposure tied to structured products and securitization vehicles. Morgan Stanley reported $325,678 million in Total Trading Assets, with a diversified breakdown across asset classes including $102,874 million in Corporate Equities and $128,806 million in Interest Rate derivatives, reflecting a broader and more balanced trading strategy. These differences highlight distinct strategic focuses: GS leans into cash instruments, JPM into securitized products, and MS into diversified trading across equities and derivatives.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and PayPal each manage their charge-off practices in consumer lending, and what does this reveal about their credit risk strategies and portfolio performance in 2024?",
      "answer": "Bank of America outlines detailed charge-off policies tied to loan categories, such as charging off credit card loans at 180 days past due and consumer vehicle loans at 120 days past due, emphasizing a structured approach to credit risk. Goldman Sachs reports $1,471 million in consumer loan charge-offs for 2024, with a net charge-off ratio of 7.6%, indicating higher credit losses in its consumer portfolio despite a provision of $1,540 million. PayPal, focusing on merchant loans, recorded $156 million in total charge-offs during 2024, with a significant portion in merchant loans and advances, reflecting a more volatile credit environment in its specialized lending segment. These differences highlight BAC's policy-driven, diversified risk management, GS's higher consumer credit stress, and PYPL's exposure to merchant credit risk.",

          "chunk_text": "and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments.\n\n## Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies\n\nNonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS  are  not  reported  as  nonperforming.  When  a  nonaccrual  loan  is  deemed uncollectible, it is ch arged off against th e allowance for credit losses. If th e ch arged off  amount is later  recovered,  the  amount  is  reversed  through  the  allowance  for credit losses at the recovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than charge- offs, net chargeoffs are reported as a negative amount.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Corporation's  policies,  consumer  real  estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured longterm standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or F reddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes  90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estatesecured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy , within 60 days of  receipt  of  notification  of  filing,  with   th e  remaining  balance  classified  as nonperforming.\n\nCredit card and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Consumer vehicle  loans  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  status  when  they  become 90 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon  confirmation  of  fraud,  unless  the  borrower's  performance  indicates  that repayment is likely to occur. These loans are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral less expected disposal costs when the loans become 120 days past due, upon repossession of the collateral, within 60 days after receipt of notification of  b a nkruptcy  or  d eath   or  up on  confirmation  of  fraud ,  and   wh en  th e  b orrower's ability to pay cannot be validated. If repossession of the collateral is not expected, the loans are fully charged off.\n\nCommercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection.\n\nBusiness card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\n\nThe  entire  balance  of  a  consumer  loan  or  commercial  loan  or  lease  is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customer's billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable  is  reversed  when  loans  and  leases  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  status. Interest  collections  on  nonaccruing  loans  and  leases  for  which  the  ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored  to  accrual  status  when  all  principal  and  interest  is  current  and  full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nLoans  that  the  Corporation  intends  to  sell  in  th e  foreseeable  future,  including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases.\n\n## Premises and Equipment\n\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nFor the Corporation's financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For assets  that  are  subject  to  collateral  maintenance  provisions,  including  federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses  are  assumed  to  be zero.  For  all  other  assets,  the  Corporation  performs qualitative  analyses,  including  consideration  of  historical  losses  and  current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset.\n\n## Lessee Arrangements\n\nSubstantially  all  of  th e  Corporation's  lessee  arrangements  are  operating  leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the",

      "answer": "Bank of America manages transaction risk through derivative contracts and collateral posting, with $2.5 billion in potential additional collateral obligations tied to credit rating downgrades. JPMorgan Chase engages in transaction activity through structured securitization trusts and conduits, including $261\u2013262 million in credit card securitization and multi-seller conduits to facilitate client market access. Mastercard operates a global payments network that enables transactions across multiple rails, emphasizing ecosystem governance, security, and consumer choice through products like credit, debit, and prepaid solutions. Together, these companies illustrate distinct but interconnected roles: BAC manages counterparty and credit risk in derivatives, JPM structures and executes transaction vehicles, and MA operates the infrastructure enabling consumer and institutional payment flows.",

      "answer": "Bank of America manages collateral levels in securities lending and repurchase agreements by requiring daily valuation of collateral and allowing for the posting or return of collateral as needed. The fair value of collateral accepted by BAC was $925.7 billion in 2024, with $882.2 billion being sold or repledged. Morgan Stanley emphasizes overcollateralization in secured lending facilities and actively monitors collateral levels against lending agreement requirements, particularly for real estate and corporate loans. Charles Schwab mandates over-collateralization for securities-based lending (PALs), with daily monitoring of collateral values and automatic liquidation if levels fall below thresholds. Schwab also applies a practical expedient based on collateral maintenance in estimating credit loss allowances for these portfolios. These approaches reflect BAC's focus on liquidity and repledging flexibility, MS's emphasis on contractual overcollateralization, and SCHW's automated risk control through daily margining and liquidation protocols.",

          "chunk_text": "\nUnder repurchase agreements, the Corporation is required to post collateral with a  market  value  equal  to  or  in  excess  of  the  principal  amount  borrowed.  For securities loaned transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other securities. T o determine whether the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily , and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional collateral or may receive or return collateral pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions are generally either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing funding from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nThe Corporation classifies borrowings with an original maturity of less than one year as  short-term  borrowings  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  At  December  3 1, 2024 and 2023, the majority of short-term borrowings consisted of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which totaled $12.7 billion and $13.2 billion, and commercial paper, which totaled $24.2 billion and $13.1 billion.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023, the fair value  of  th is  collateral  was  $925.7  b illion  and   $911.3  b illion,  of  wh ich   $882.2 billion  and  $870.9  billion  were  sold  or  repledged.  The  primary  source  of  this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell.\n\nThe Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. T reasury tax and loan notes, and short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn  certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These  assets  are  included  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  in  Assets  of Consolidated VIEs.\n\nIn addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts. Required collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty . Generally ,  the  Corporation  accepts  collateral  in  th e  form  of cash, U.S. T reasury securities and other marketable securities. Based on provisions contained  in  master  netting  agreements,  the  Corporation  nets  cash  collateral received  against  derivative  assets.  The  Corporation  also  pledges  collateral  on  its own derivative positions which can be applied against derivative liabilities. For more information on the collateral of derivatives, see Note 3 - Derivatives.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nAt  December 3 1,  202 4  and  2023,  the  Corporation  held  restricted  cash  included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $6.1 billion and  $5.6  billion,  predominantly  related  to  cash  segregated  in  compliance  with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with central banks to meet reserve requirements.",

Event-driven loans and lending commitments are extended in  connection  with  specific  client  transactions  and  are  ex plained  in  further detail in 'Institutional Securities Event-Driven Loans and Lending Commitments' herein.\n\nSecured  lending  facilities include loans  provided  to  clients,  which  are collateralized  by  various  assets,  including  residential  and  commercial  real estate mortgage loans, investor commitments for capital calls, corporate loans and other assets.  These facilities  generally  provide  for  overcollateralization.

For securities loaned, Schwab typically receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of securities loaned; the payables from these transactions are included in payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations on the consolidated balance sheets. In instances where the Company is acting as the lender and receives securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral, the Company recognizes the collateral received at fair value and the obligation to return the collateral in the consolidated balance sheets. The market value of securities borrowed and loaned is monitored and collateral is adjusted to ensure full collateralization. Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest ex pense. Schwab applies the practical ex pedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for securities borrowed receivables.\n\n## Bank loans and related allowance for loan losses\n\nBank loans held for investments are recorded at amortized cost, which is comprised of the contractual principal amounts adjusted for unamortized direct origination costs or net purchase discounts or premiums. Interest income on bank loans is recognized using the effective interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. Direct origination costs and premiums and discounts are recognized in interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayments. Additionally, management estimates an allowance for credit losses, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to arrive at the amount expected to be collected. The bank loan portfolio includes three portfolio segments: residential real estate, PALs, and other loans. We use these segments when developing and documenting our methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. The residential real estate portfolio segment is divided into two classes of financing receivables for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit risk: First Mortgages and HELOCs.\n\nSchwab records an allowance for credit losses through a charge to provision for credit losses, included in other revenue, based on our estimate of current expected credit losses for the ex isting portfolio. We review the allowance for credit losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss ex perience, and any other risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at an appropriate level.\n\nSubstantially all PALs are collateralized by marketable securities with liquid markets. Credit lines are over-collateralized and borrowers are required to maintain collateral at specified levels at all times. The required collateral levels are determined based on the type of security pledged. Additionally, collateral market value is monitored on a daily basis and a borrower's credit line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels. As such, the credit loss inherent within this portfolio is limited. Schwab applies the practical ex pedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for PALs.\n\nThe methodology to establish an allowance for credit losses for the residential real estate portfolio segment utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and expected losses for this portfolio segment based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segment. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the classes of financing receivables, including loan products within those classes, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral.\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated using a loan-level model that projects each loan's behavior over its term based on forecasted voluntary housing turnover, the rates of refinancing, delinquency transition rates, and severity of loss. The model takes into account the current relevant risk indicators, including each loan's term and structure, current delinquency status, and the estimated current LTV ratio, as well as borrower FICO scores and current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury, SOFR, Prime, and mortgage rates. The more significant variables in the model include delinquency roll rates, housing prices, interest rates, and the unemployment rate. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from our historical loss ex perience over a full economic cycle. Loss severity (i.e., loss given default) estimates are based on forecasted net equity associated with each loan and property, as well as loss ex perience and market trends, both current and forecasted. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Mortgage rates are estimated based on forecasted spread, while the rest of the interest rates used by the model are projected based on the forward rates. The unemployment rate forecast is typically based on the recent consensus of regularly published economic surveys. Linear interpolation is applied to revert to long-term trends after the reasonable and supportable forecast period.\n\nThe methodology described above results in loss factors that are applied to the amortized cost basis of loans, exclusive of accrued interest receivable, to determine the allowance for credit losses for First Mortgages and HELOCs.",

      "question": "How do American Express (AXP), Capital One (COF), and PayPal (PYPL) each characterize their loan portfolios in terms of delinquency trends, credit risk exposure, and overall loan balances, and what does this reveal about their respective risk management strategies in 2022?",
      "answer": "American Express reported total loans of $70.5 billion in 2022, with a net write-off rate of 1.3% and a 30+ days past due rate of 0.7%, indicating relatively strong credit quality and conservative underwriting. Capital One disclosed $1.195 billion in >90 days and accruing loans and $1.1 billion in nonperforming loans, suggesting higher delinquency pressures, particularly in its credit card and commercial portfolios. PayPal, focused on installment loans, had $1,613 million in total revolving and installment loans, with 97.9% current and only 2.1% delinquent, showing a highly performing loan book with minimal risk exposure. Collectively, these differences highlight varied credit risk strategies: AXP maintains high average spending and disciplined write-offs, COF faces broader delinquency challenges across multiple segments, and PYPL operates with a low-risk, consumer-focused installment model.",

MetLife asserts that it has sufficient liquidity to meet key obligations including debt payments, dividends, and capital contributions, even under stress scenarios. Visa states that its current and projected liquidity sources are sufficient to meet needs beyond the next 12 months, though it continues to monitor conditions. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies emphasize liquidity sufficiency, they frame it in relation to distinct strategic priorities: product support for BlackRock, capital structure and debt for MetLife, and operational and market adaptability for Visa.",

JPMorgan Chase emphasizes that its ability to retain clients depends on evolving with changing client expectations, managing competition, and adapting to new technologies, especially as non-bank competitors disrupt traditional banking services. Visa, while not directly facing client retention in the same way, notes that its business depends on merchants and processors maintaining broad acceptance of Visa-branded products, and that merchant-led efforts to reduce interchange fees or steer transaction routing could negatively impact consumer usage and transaction volumes.

          "chunk_text": "## Changes in accounting standards or assum ptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us.\n\nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or  liabilities  and   results  of  operations  and  are  critical  because  they  require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that  are  inherently  uncertain.  If  assumptions,  estimates  or  judgments  are erroneously  applied,  we  could  be  required  to  correct  and  restate  prior-period financial  statements.  Accounting  standard-setters  and  those  who  interpret  the accounting standards, including the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations  or  positions  on  how  various  standards  should  be  applied.  These changes may be difficult to predict and could impact the preparation and reporting of our financial statements, including the application of new or revised standards retrospectively ,  resulting  in  unexpected  losses,  revisions  to  prior-period   financial statements and other adverse impacts to us, including legal and regulatory risk.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations.\n\nWe  could  be  adversely  affected  if  U.S.  and  foreign  governmental  authorities further change tax laws, including changes to the T ax Cuts and Jobs Act of 20 1 7 and  Inflation Reduction  Act of 2022.  Also, new  guidelines issued by  the Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD),  which  are currently being enacted into law in some OECD countries in which we operate, are expected to impose a 15 percent global minimum tax on a country-by-country basis. Any implementation of and/or change in U.S. and foreign tax laws and regulations or  interpretations  of  current  or  future  tax  laws  and   regulations  could   materially adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax liabilities and results of operations. U.S. and foreign tax laws are complex and our judgments, interpretations or applications of such tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental authority . This could  result  in  additional  tax  liab ilities  and   interest,  p enalties,  th e  red uction  of certain  tax  benefits  and/or  the  requirement  to  make  adjustments  to  amounts recorded, which could be material.\n\nAlso, we have U.K. net deferred tax assets (DT A) which consist primarily of net operating  losses  that  are  expected  to  be  realized  in  a  U.K.  subsidiary  over  an extended number of years. Adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors, such as prolonged worsening of international capital markets or changes in the ability of our U.K. subsidiary to conduct business in the markets outside the U.K., could lead our management to reassess and/or change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our U.K. net DTA.\n\n## Reputation\n\n## Damage  to  our  reputation  could  harm   our  businesses,  including  our competitive position and business prospects.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain clients, investors and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including actual or perceived activities of our officers, directors, employees, other representatives, clients and third parties, including counterparties, such as fraud, misconduct and unethical behavior, adequacy of our ability to detect, prevent and/or respond  to  fraud  perpetrated  against  our  clients,  and  the  handling  of  related disputes regarding the use of our products and services, including electronic payments, effectiveness of our internal controls, the fees charged to our clients, including overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees, compensation practices, lending practices, suitability or reasonableness of particular trading or investment strategies, the services offered to our clients, the reliability  of  our  research   and   mod els  and   p roh ib iting  clients  from  engaging  in certain transactions.\n\nOur reputation may also be harmed by actual or perceived failure to deliver the products,  standards  of  service  and  quality  expected  by  our  clients  and  the community,  including  the  overstatement  or  mislabeling  of  the  environmental benefits of our products, services or transactions, the failure to protect our clients and/or recognize and address client complaints, compliance failures, technology changes,  the  implementation,  management  and  use  of  emerging  technologies, including  AI,  th e  failure  to  maintain  effective  d ata  management,  cybersecurity incidents and information and security breaches affecting us and our employees, clients and third parties, which have occurred and which we expect to continue to occur with increased frequency and severity , prolonged or repeated system outages, our privacy policies, the unintended disclosure of or failure to safeguard personal, proprietary  or  confidential  information,  the  breach  of  our  fiduciary  obligations, employment  practices  and  the  handling  of  widespread  health  emergencies  or pandemics.  Our  reputation  may  also  be  harmed  by  litigation  and/or  regulatory matters and their outcomes, and/or criticism or challenges by third parties, relating to  the  topics  discussed  above  or  otherwise.  Challenges  and  criticisms  to  our environmental and social practices and disclosures, and those of our clients and third parties, including from third parties, who may have diverging views regarding those practices and disclosures, may also harm our reputation.\n\nIncreases in market interest rates have resulted in increased focus on asset and liability management, including HTM and AFS securities and related unrealized losses. Perceptions of our liquidity and financial condition, actions by the financial services industry generally, or by certain members or individuals in the industry may harm  our  reputation.  Adverse  publicity  or  negative  information  posted  on  social media by employees, the media or otherwise, whether or not factually correct, may trigger  a  loss  of  trust  or  confidence  on  the  part  of  clients,  counterparties, shareholders,  investors,  debt  holders,  market  analysts,  other  relevant  parties  or regulators, adversely impacting our business prospects and results of operations.\n\nWe are  subject  to  complex  and  evolving  LRRs  and  interpretations,  including regarding  fair  lending  activity ,  UDAAP ,  electronic  funds  transfers,  know-yourcustomer requirements, data protection and privacy (including the GDPR and the CCPA), cross-border data movement and data localization, cybersecurity , the use and development of AI, data and technology and other matters, as well as evolving and expansive interpretations of these LRRs. Principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably across jurisdictions, and  regulatory  and  public  expectations  regarding  the  definition  and  scope  of consumer and commercial privacy and data protection remains fluid. These laws may  be  interpreted  and  applied  by  various  jurisdictions  inconsistent  with  our current  or  future  practices,  or  with  one  another.  If  personal,  confidential  or proprietary information of clients in our possession, or in the possession of third parties or financial data aggregators, is mishandled, misused or mismanaged, or if we do not timely or adequately address such information, we may face regulatory , legal and operational risks, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.",

          "chunk_text": "JPMorganChase's ability to dev elop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectiv es could be adv ersely affected by any failure on the part of management to:\n\n- devise effectiv e business plans and strategies\n- offer products and serv ices that meet changing expectations of clients and customers\n- allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorganChase to build and inv est in market-leading businesses, ev en in a highly stressed env ironment\n- allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjectiv e judgments made in connection with those allocations\n- appropriately assess and monitor principal inv estments made to enhance or accelerate JPMorganChase's business strategies\n- conduct appropriate due diligence on prospectiv e business acquisitions or inv estments, or effectiv ely integrate newly-acquired businesses\n- appropriately address concerns of clients, customers, inv estors, employees and other stakeholders, including with respect to climate and other ESG matters\n- react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or\n- develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources and capabilities necessary to grow and manage JPMorganChase's businesses.\n\nFurthermore, JPMorganChase may incur costs in connection with disposing of excess properties, premises and facilities, and those costs could be material to its results of operations.\n\n## JPMorganChase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.\n\nJPMorganChase operates in a highly competitiv e env ironment in which it must evolv e and adapt to changes in financial regulation, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorganChase expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial serv ices industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:\n\n- other banks and financial institutions\n- trading, adv isory and inv estment management firms\n- finance companies\n- technology companies, and\n- other non-bank firms that are engaged in prov iding similar as well as new products and serv ices.\n\nJPMorganChase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial serv ices industry will not materially and adv ersely affect its future results of operations. For example, aggressiv e or less disciplined lending practices by non-bank competitors could lead to a loss of market share for traditional banks, and in an economic downturn could result in instability in the financial serv ices industry and adv ersely impact other market participants, including JPMorganChase.\n\nNew competitors in the financial serv ices industry continue to emerge. For example, technological adv ances and the growth of e-commerce hav e made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and serv ices that traditionally were banking products. These adv ances hav e also allowed financial institutions and other companies to prov ide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based inv estment adv ice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their nonbanking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and serv ices, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers, that may not require intermediation. New technologies hav e required and could require JPMorganChase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and serv ices offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorganChase's costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and serv ices through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorganChase earns from prov iding products and serv ices through those technologies.\n\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorganChase's products and services or may cause JPMorganChase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products. This competition may be based on quality and v ariety of products and serv ices offered, transaction execution, innov ation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorganChase's businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or serv ice, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorganChase's ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce",

Certain merchants and merchant-affiliated groups hav e been exerting their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions, such  as  the  U.S., Australia,  Canada  and  Europe,  to  attempt  to  lower  acceptance  costs  paid  by  merchants  to  acquirers  or  their  agents  to  accept payment products or serv ices, by lobbying for new legislation, seeking regulatory interv ention, filing lawsuits and in some cases, surcharging or refusing to accept Visa products. If they are successful in their efforts, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses, issuers may decrease their issuance of our products, and consumer usage of our products could be adv ersely impacted. For example, in the U.S., certain stakeholders hav e raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact debit routing choice and the cost of payment card acceptance. In addition to ongoing litigation related to the U.S. migration to EMV-capable cards and point-of-sale terminals, U.S. merchant-affiliated groups and processors hav e expressed concerns regarding the EMV certification process and some policymakers hav e expressed concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as EMVCo and the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council in the dev elopment of payment card standards. Additionally, many merchants have advocated for lower acceptance costs in the form of reduced interchange rates, which could result in some issuers eliminating or reducing their promotion or use of Visa's products and serv ices, eliminating or reducing cardholder benefits such as rewards programs, or charging account holders increased or new fees for using Visa-branded products, all of which could negativ ely impact Visa's transaction v olumes and related rev enue. Finally, some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and Visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale, including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of Visa products, to mandate only PIN authenticated transactions, to differentiate or steer among Visa product types issued by different financial institutions, and to impose surcharges on customers presenting Visa products as their form of payment. If successful, these efforts could adv ersely impact consumers' usage of our products and decrease our ov erall transaction v olumes and net rev enue, lead to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation that increases our compliance and litigation expenses, and ultimately harm our business.\n\n## We  depend  on  relationships  with  financial  institutions,  acquirers,  processors,  merchants,  payment  facilitators,  ecommerce  platforms, fintechs and other third parties.\n\nAs  noted  abov e,  our  relationships  with  industry  participants  are  complex  and  require  us  to  balance  the  interests  of  multiple  third  parties.  For instance, we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to prov ide  our  products  and  serv ices,  and  thereby  compete  effectiv ely  in  the  marketplace.  We  offer  incentiv es  to  merchants,  acquirers,  ecommerce platforms  and  processors  to  encourage  routing  preference  and  acceptance  growth.  We  also  engage  in  many  payment  card  co-branding  efforts  with merchants,  who  receiv e  incentiv es  from  us. As  emerging  participants  such  as  fintechs  enter  the  payments  industry,  we  engage  in  discussions  to address the role they may play in the ecosystem, whether as, for example, an issuer, merchant, ecommerce platform or digital wallet prov ider. As these and other relationships become more prev alent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain  and  grow  these  relationships.  In  addition,  we  depend  on  our  clients  and  third  parties,  including  network  partners,  v endors  and  suppliers,  to submit, facilitate and process transactions properly, prov ide v arious serv ices associated with our payments network on our behalf, and otherwise adhere to  our  operating rules and applicable laws. As our clients expand their global footprint, their legal and regulatory obligations can become ev en more complex. From time to time, our relationships may be affected by actions of our clients and industry participants that may materially and adv ersely impact our business, products or serv ices, and to the extent we or such parties fail to perform or deliv er adequate serv ices or comply with regulatory obligations, it may result in negativ e experiences for account holders or others when using their Visa-branded payment products, which could harm our business and reputation.\n\n## Our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation, or if we experience brand disintermediation.\n\nOur brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business. We believ e that our clients and their account holders associate our brand with acceptance,  security,  conv enience,  speed,  and  reliability.  Our  success  depends  in  large  part  on  our  ability  to  maintain  the  v alue  of  our  brand  and reputation of our products and serv ices in the payments ecosystem, elev ate the brand through new and existing products, serv ices and partnerships, and",

      "answer": "Capital One (COF) provides a detailed note (Note 13) specifically addressing Earnings Per Common Share, indicating a focused disclosure on this metric. MetLife (MET) explains its methodology for computing both basic and diluted earnings per share, emphasizing the dilutive effect of stock-based awards under the treasury stock method. Charles Schwab (SCHW) includes Earnings Per Common Share as Note 26, suggesting a structured approach to segmenting financial disclosures.

The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nChanges to GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') in the form of Accounting Standards Updates ('ASUs') to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.

      "answer": "AXP's 10-K filing outlines a comprehensive structure for its loan portfolio, emphasizing risk factors, regulatory oversight, and detailed disclosures on capital resources and liquidity, indicating a strong focus on risk management and regulatory compliance. COF provides granular segmentation of its loan portfolio into credit card, consumer banking, and commercial banking loans, with clear classifications for held-for-investment and held-for-sale loans, reflecting a strategic and segmented approach to credit risk. MS, on the other hand, discloses its loan exposure across multiple international markets, with specific figures for net exposure in countries like the UK, Korea, and Brazil, suggesting a globally diversified loan portfolio with region-specific risk considerations. Together, these disclosures highlight distinct approaches: AXP emphasizes regulatory and internal controls, COF focuses on segmentation and intent-based loan classification, and MS prioritizes geographic diversification and hedging strategies to manage credit risk.",

      "answer": "Bank of America reports $28,397 million in preferred stock issued and outstanding in 2023, unchanged from 2022, indicating a stable capital structure with no new issuances or redemptions. Morgan Stanley shows $8,750 million in preferred stock, also unchanged year-over-year, suggesting a similar conservative approach to preferred equity. In contrast, Visa reports a decline in preferred stock from $1,698 million in 2023 to $1,031 million in 2024, indicating a potential redemption or repurchase of preferred shares, signaling a shift in capital management strategy. The differences highlight Bank of America and Morgan Stanley maintaining preferred stock as a consistent capital buffer, while Visa is actively reducing its preferred stock exposure.",

      "question": "How do AIG, Goldman Sachs (GS), and MetLife (MET) each reflect the role of 'issuances' in shaping their respective financial obligations and liabilities, and what does this reveal about their exposure to future policyholder commitments and debt financing activities?",
      "answer": "AIG reports issuances of $88 million and $93 million in 2024 for expected net premiums and future policy benefits, respectively, indicating a relatively modest increase in underwriting activity. Goldman Sachs, in contrast, shows significantly larger issuances tied to its borrowings, with $1,086 million in deposit-related issuances, $51 million in secured financings, and $3,748 million in unsecured long-term borrowings, reflecting its heavy reliance on debt financing. MetLife reports much higher issuances of $558 million for both expected net premiums and future policy benefits, signaling substantial underwriting growth. Collectively, these figures highlight differing business models: AIG and MetLife focus on insurance underwriting with varying intensity, while GS emphasizes capital markets and debt-based financing.",

        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Issuances: AIG discloses $88 million in issuances related to expected net premiums and $93 million for future policy benefits in 2024, indicating new policy activity contributing to liability growth.",

        "Hop 3: MET \u2192 Issuances: MET discloses $558 million in issuances for both expected net premiums and future policy benefits in 2024, significantly higher than AIG, suggesting more aggressive underwriting activity."

      "answer": "American Express reported $31.99 billion in total small business loans, with $31.63 billion due within one year, indicating a short-duration, potentially lower-risk loan book. Bank of America noted that small business card loans constituted 53% of its U.S. small business commercial portfolio, with a significant $197 million in accruing loans past due 90 days or more, suggesting higher credit risk in this segment. Capital One, while not providing specific loan balances, highlights small business loans as part of its retail banking offerings, emphasizing geographic diversification through its branch network, which may imply a more localized and diversified risk profile. Synthesizing these perspectives, American Express appears to focus on short-term, potentially less risky small business credit products, Bank of America shows a larger and more risk-exposed position, and Capital One emphasizes geographic diversification as a risk mitigation strategy.",

MetLife, in contrast, takes a forward-looking, discounted cash flow approach to estimate recovery value for fixed maturity securities, incorporating macroeconomic conditions, issuer fundamentals, and credit enhancements, with recoveries factored into its allowance for credit losses (ACL) adjustments. When combined, these perspectives reveal that banks like BAC and COF focus on realized recovery amounts from loan portfolios, while MET emphasizes predictive modeling and fair value recovery expectations in its investment portfolio, reflecting divergent approaches to recoveries across banking and insurance subsectors.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley differ in their treatment and calculation approaches to Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA), and what does this reveal about their capital adequacy strategies?",
      "answer": "Bank of America primarily defines RWA in the context of regulatory and Basel III terminology within its glossary, emphasizing its role in capital adequacy without disclosing specific RWA figures. JPMorgan Chase provides a detailed explanation of RWA under the Basel III framework, describing the differences between the Standardized and Advanced approaches, particularly how internal credit models affect RWA calculations. Morgan Stanley, in contrast, offers concrete numerical disclosures, reporting total RWA of $471.834 billion as of December 31, 2024, along with capital ratios that directly tie to RWA. These differences suggest that while all three firms are subject to RWA requirements, their transparency and strategic emphasis vary, with Morgan Stanley providing the most quantitative insight into its capital adequacy position.",

Goldman Sachs discloses specific SLR figures of 8.0% for 2024 and 7.4% for 2023, showing a measurable increase in their leverage ratio over the year. JPMorgan Chase includes SLR in its glossary without disclosing specific figures, indicating a more qualitative treatment of the metric.

Represents Tier 1 Capital divided by Total Leverage Exposure.\n\nSOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n\nSPEs: Special purpose entities\n\nStandardized Approach: Established through Basel III, the Standardized Approach aligns regulatory capital requirements more closely with the key elements of banking risk by introducing a wider differentiation of risk weights and a wider recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques, while avoiding excessive complexity. Accordingly, the Standardized Approach produces capital ratios more in line with the actual economic risks that banks face.\n\nTangible book value per share (TBVPS)*: Represents tangible common equity divided by EOP common shares outstanding.\n\nTangible common equity (TCE): Represents common stockholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, other than MSRs.\n\nTaxable-equivalent basis: Represents the total revenue, net of interest ex pense for the business, adjusted for revenue from investments that receive tax credits and the impact of tax-exempt securities.

      "question": "How do AIG, COF, and MET each quantify or describe the impact of the unemployment rate on their respective financial performance or risk exposure, and what does this reveal about their sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions?",
      "answer": "AIG indirectly references the unemployment rate through its disclosures related to macroeconomic factors affecting its insurance and investment portfolios, suggesting awareness of its influence on claims and asset values. COF explicitly states that the unemployment rate correlates with credit risk in its credit card loan portfolio, and it monitors delinquency trends in response to economic shifts such as changes in unemployment and GDP. MET indicates that rising unemployment negatively impacts its business, likely through reduced consumer spending and lower insurance policy retention or new sales. Together, these perspectives show that while all three firms acknowledge the unemployment rate as a key macroeconomic risk factor, they experience its effects through different channels\u2014credit performance (COF), investment and underwriting risk (AIG), and consumer demand or policyholder behavior (MET).",

      "answer": "AXP reported $30,497 million in other liabilities in 2021, indicating a significant portion of its total liabilities. MA disclosed $12 million in other liabilities for 2021, reflecting minimal exposure compared to AXP. V reported $3,535 million in other liabilities for 2022, showing a moderate level of non-core obligations. These figures suggest that AXP has the highest relative exposure to other liabilities, while MA maintains a much smaller liability base in this category, potentially signaling different risk profiles or business models.",

BAC highlights a forward-looking allowance framework that integrates macroeconomic scenarios, including unemployment rates and real estate prices, and applies qualitative reserves to account for uncertainties, especially in nonaccrual loan volumes. MS provides a quantitative snapshot of its nonaccrual loan exposure, showing a total of $86 million in nonaccrual loans without an allowance for credit loss (ACL) in 2023, down from $117 million in 2022, indicating a more conservative write-down or resolution strategy. Together, these approaches show AIG focusing on predictive modeling, BAC emphasizing scenario-based forecasting and qualitative adjustments, and MS demonstrating a more transparent, balance-sheet-driven approach to nonaccrual loan risk.",

      "answer": "Bank of America maintained a consistent total goodwill of $69,021 million in both 2023 and 2024 across its business segments, indicating no significant changes in acquired asset valuations. JPMorgan Chase reported a slight decline in total goodwill from $52,634 million in 2023 to $52,565 million in 2024, suggesting minor goodwill adjustments or potential impairments. PayPal, on the other hand, experienced a steady decrease in total goodwill, from $11,209 million in 2022 to $10,837 million in 2024, with annual adjustments indicating ongoing revaluation or restructuring of acquired assets. The differing trends highlight contrasting approaches to goodwill management: BAC's stability suggests long-term asset confidence, JPM's slight decline reflects cautious adjustments, and PYPL's consistent reduction points to active portfolio recalibration.",

JPMorgan Chase discloses specific quantitative RWA figures under different Basel III frameworks, showing $1.67 trillion in RWA for the firm under the Standardized Approach and $1.67 trillion under the Advanced Approach, with CET1 ratios of 15.0% and 15.0%, respectively. Morgan Stanley explains that RWA incorporates credit, market, and operational risks and highlights differences in RWA calculations between the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, noting that the former results in lower differences between actual and required capital ratios.

Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends as well as consumers' financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we consider when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they measure the creditworthiness of borrowers. Delinquency trends are the key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our retail banking loan portfolio.\n\nThe table below presents our consumer banking portfolio of loans held for investment by credit quality indicator as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. We present our auto loan portfolio by Fair Isaac Corporation ('FICO') scores at origination and our retail banking loan portfolio by delinquency status, which includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.\n\n## Table 4.4: Consumer Banking Portfolio by Vintage Year\n\n",

      "answer": "AIG reports a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 59% for its commercial mortgages as of December 31, 2023, indicating a conservative underwriting stance with regular collateral valuation updates. COF defines the LTV ratio as the percentage relationship between a loan\u2019s principal amount and the appraised value of the collateral, suggesting a more standardized risk measurement approach. JPM highlights geographic concentration in its residential real estate portfolio, noting that average LTV ratios have improved due to rising home prices, particularly in high-value states like California and New York. Together, these perspectives reveal that AIG emphasizes collateral conservatism, COF focuses on definition and standardization, and JPM integrates LTV with macroeconomic trends in its credit risk strategy.",

      "question": "How do Citigroup (C), Capital One (COF), and MetLife (MET) each characterize their transfers out of Level 3 assets, and what does this reveal about their respective fair value measurement strategies and market responsiveness?",
      "answer": "Citigroup (C) reported transfers out of Level 3 assets totaling $2,114 million for trading non-derivative assets and $974 million for trading derivatives, indicating significant movement of assets to more observable pricing models. Capital One (COF) noted that transfers out of Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of assumptions corroborated by market observable information, signaling a shift toward more transparent pricing. MetLife (MET) reported transfers out of Level 3 assets at $10 million for short-term investments and $11 million for net derivatives, showing more limited movement compared to C but aligned with a disciplined fair value reassessment process. Together, these figures suggest varying degrees of market integration and fair value strategy execution across the firms.",

        "Hop 2: COF \u2192 Transfers out of Level 3: Capital One explained that transfers out were driven by the use of market-corroborated assumptions, reflecting a strategic move toward more observable inputs in fair value measurements.",
        "Hop 3: MET \u2192 Transfers out of Level 3: MetLife reported specific transfers out of $10 million in short-term investments and $11 million in net derivatives, showing smaller but deliberate adjustments in fair value categorization."

(3)\n\n## Level 3 Recurring Fair Value Rollforward\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Generally, transfers into Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of unobservable assumptions in the pricing of these financial instruments as evidenced by wider pricing variations among pricing vendors and transfers out of Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of assumptions corroborated by market observable information as evidenced by tighter pricing among multiple pricing sources.\n\n## Table 17.2: L ev el 3 R ecurring Fair V alue R ollforw ard\n\n",

      "answer": "American Express reported total deposits of $139.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, with $12.4 billion being uninsured, indicating a relatively small but growing deposit base, particularly among high-net-worth individuals. Bank of America had significantly larger total deposits of $1.965 trillion as of the same date, with a detailed breakdown showing a mix of U.S. and non-U.S. deposits, reflecting its broad retail and commercial banking footprint. Goldman Sachs reported total deposits of $433.0 billion as of December 2024, with a notable portion in consumer savings and demand accounts ($310.3 billion), suggesting a strong digital banking and wealth management-driven deposit strategy. Collectively, these figures highlight differing deposit-gathering models: AXP focusing on premium card-member deposits, BAC leveraging its extensive branch and customer network, and GS capitalizing on its private wealth and digital platforms.",

      "answer": "Bank of America extends interest-only residential mortgage loans to Wealth Management clients, many of which are well-collateralized and have interest-only periods ranging from three to ten years, with substantial portions not amortizing until 2026 or later. Goldman Sachs offers other collateralized loans to Wealth Management clients, secured by assets such as corporate and consumer loans or capital commitments from fund investors, with a strong emphasis on collateral-backed lending outside of traditional real estate or securities-based loans. Morgan Stanley sources a majority of their deposits from Wealth Management clients, which are considered stable and low-cost, and saw an increase in 2024 driven by growth in Savings and Time deposits. These strategies reflect BAC\u2019s focus on structured residential financing, GS\u2019s emphasis on diversified collateralized lending, and MS\u2019s reliance on Wealth Management-driven deposit stability.",

Th e outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that  had  entered  the  amortization  period  was  $3.6  billion,  or  six  percent,  at December 3 1, 202 4. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period  generally  experience  a  higher  rate  of  early  stage  delinquencies  and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At December  3 1,  202 4,  $65  million,  or  two  percent,  of  outstanding  interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.0 billion, or less than one percent, for the entire  residential  mortgage  portfolio.  In  addition,  at  December  3 1,  202 4,  $209 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $56 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three years to 10 years. Substantially all of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2026 or later.\n\nTable 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. In the New Y ork area, the New Y ork-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) made up 15 percent of outstandings at both December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. The  Los  Angeles-Long  Beach-Santa  Ana  MSA  within  California  represented  1 4 percent of outstandings at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.",

      "answer": "Capital One (COF) treats marketing costs as expenses incurred to attract and retain customers through advertising, promotional materials, and customer incentives, and these costs are expensed as incurred. MetLife (MET) highlights that marketing costs are elevated during the fourth quarter due to annual benefit renewals, enrollment, and marketing initiatives, particularly in promoting voluntary products to employees. Visa (V) reports a 16% year-over-year increase in marketing expenses in 2023, rising from $1,336 million in 2022 to $1,341 million in 2023, indicating a growing investment in marketing efforts. Together, these perspectives reveal that while COF focuses on direct customer incentives, MET experiences seasonal marketing pressures, and Visa is increasing its marketing spend, suggesting differing strategic emphases on customer engagement across the financial services sector.",

      "answer": "Bank of America highlights that uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions, health emergencies, and regulatory scrutiny could result in heightened operational, reputational, and compliance risks, which may lead to additional losses. Morgan Stanley emphasizes the potential for financial loss due to operational risks such as system failures, cyberattacks, and third-party vulnerabilities, noting that these risks could harm its business and reputation. Charles Schwab outlines that operational risk arises from internal processes, people, systems, or external events, and manages these risks through internal controls, testing, and insurance, while also noting that business interruptions could negatively impact operations and lead to financial loss. Collectively, this reveals that while all three firms recognize operational risk as a key driver of potential financial loss, their strategies and emphasis differ based on their operational complexity and client-facing models.",

      "question": "How do Bank of America, Capital One, and JPMorgan Chase each reflect the impact of credit card loan delinquencies and charge-off policies on their 2023 financial provisions and consumer loan management strategies?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reported a $4.4 billion provision for credit losses in 2023, driven largely by late-stage delinquent credit card loans and loan growth, despite improved macroeconomic conditions. Capital One disclosed specific charge-off timelines for credit card loans, including a 180-day charge-off policy for delinquent accounts and a 120-day policy for accounts with revoked revolving privileges, which directly affects their provisioning and loan recovery strategies. JPMorgan Chase highlighted loan modifications for credit card borrowers in financial difficulty, which are now reported as FDMs (Financially Distressed Modifications), typically involving fixed payment plans over 60 months and reduced interest rates, though these accounts remain subject to standard charge-off policies if payments are not met. Together, these perspectives illustrate differing financial impacts and strategic approaches to managing delinquencies and credit risk in the credit card loan segment.",

      "answer": "Bank of America reported total capital of $251,399 million under the Standardized Approach and $241,449 million under the Advanced Approaches, with total capital ratios of 15.2% and 16.6%, respectively. BlackRock showed significantly higher capital ratios, with total capital at 145.8% of risk-weighted assets, far exceeding the minimum requirement of 8%. In contrast, Capital One did not explicitly disclose total capital ratios or risk-weighted asset figures, instead focusing on total assets of $89,215 million and stockholders' equity of $58,089 million, suggesting a less transparent or differently structured capital reporting approach. These differences highlight Bank of America's emphasis on regulatory compliance across multiple frameworks, BlackRock's conservative capital position relative to regulatory thresholds, and Capital One's potentially opaque or distinct capital structure, which may reflect differing strategic priorities in managing financial risk and meeting supervisory expectations.",

      "question": "How do American Express (AXP), Citigroup (C), and Capital One (COF) differ in their 2024 year-end 'Cash and due from banks' balances, and what might these differences indicate about their liquidity strategies or geographic focus?",
      "answer": "In 2024, American Express (AXP) reported $3,370 million in U.S. 'Cash and due from banks,' while Citigroup (C) reported $3,325 million in total 'Cash and due from banks.' Capital One (COF), however, reported a significantly higher amount of $3,028 million in 'Cash and due from banks,' despite also holding a large amount in interest-bearing deposits. These differences may reflect AXP\u2019s more modest liquidity positioning, C\u2019s relatively stable cash positioning with slight decline, and COF\u2019s broader liquidity strategy that includes both cash and interest-bearing instruments. The differences suggest variations in how each institution manages liquidity, potentially influenced by business model focus and geographic operations.",
