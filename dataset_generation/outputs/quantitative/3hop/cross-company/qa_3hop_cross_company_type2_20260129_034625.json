          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nFuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Mississippi Power - Fuel Cost Recovery\" and Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Fuel Costs\" for additional information.\n\nFuel expense decreased $75 million, or 14.5%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to a 10.8% decrease in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated and a 7.1% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.\n\nPurchased power expense increased $14 million, or 63.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to a 56.7% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased and a 3.0% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased.\n\nEnergy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.\n\n## Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses\n\nOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $8 million, or 2.2%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $10 million in reliability reserve accruals, $6 million in generation ex penses primarily associated with non-outage costs, and $4 million in certain compensation and benefits expenses. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $12 million associated with previously deferred Plant Ratcliffe expenses that fully amortized in December 2023 and $4 million associated with the Kemper County energy facility largely due to a decrease in dismantlement costs in 2024 when compared to 2023. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements under \"Mississippi Power - Reliability Reserve Accounting Order\" and \"Other Matters - Mississippi Power,\" respectively, for additional information.\n\n## Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized\n\nInterest ex pense, net of amounts capitalized increased $6 million, or 8.5%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of approximately $4 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $2 million related to higher interest rates. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY \"Sources of Capital\" and \"Financing Activities\" herein and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net decreased $8 million, or 22.9%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase of $13 million in charitable donations, partially offset by an increase of $3 million in customer charges related to contributions in aid of construction.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes increased $11 million, or 30.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to a decrease of $6 million in the flowback of certain ex cess deferred income taxes and higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Southern Power\n\nNet income attributable to Southern Power for 2024 was $328 million, a $29 million decrease from 2023. The decrease was primarily related to increases in scheduled outage and maintenance expenses, a prior year receipt of an arbitration award for losses previously incurred, and a prior year gain on the sale of spare parts, partially offset by an increase in PPA capacity revenues related to new natural gas PPAs and higher HLBV income associated with tax equity partnerships.",

The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.\n\nAt FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n\nIn NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE estimates the fair v alue of these deriv ativ es using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing observable inputs.\n\nCertain derivative transactions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category in computing  adjusted  earnings  and  could  be  significant  to  NEER's  results  because  the  economic  offset  to  the  positions  are  not  marked  to  market. A s  a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP . For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Overview and Energy M arketing and Trading and M arket Risk Sensitivity.\n\n## Accounting for Pension Benefits\n\nNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. M anagement believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well-funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefits under the plan. NEE allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nFor the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value, as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including an estimate of the average remaining life of employees/survivors as well as the average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. NEE derives pension income from actuarial calculations based on the plan's provisions and various management assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy reports a net state income tax impact of $1 million (effectively neutral), indicating minimal influence on its overall effective tax rate of 6.7%. NextEra Energy shows a total state income tax expense of $131 million in 2023, contributing to a more pronounced state-level tax burden compared to prior years. Southern Company, in contrast, reports a mixed impact with a 5.5% positive contribution from state income taxes to its effective tax rate, while several of its subsidiaries experienced negative contributions, suggesting tax credits or deferred benefits. These differences highlight varied exposures to state-level tax policies and distinct regulatory environments across their service territories.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reported a $29 million loss in equity earnings in 2021, primarily due to the impacts of Texas Storm Uri. NextEra Energy (NEE) reported $666 million in equity earnings from equity method investees in 2021, indicating a significant positive contribution from its investments. Southern Company (SO) reported $76 million in earnings from equity method investments in 2021, reflecting a smaller but stable contribution. These figures reveal that NEE relies more heavily on equity method investments for profitability compared to SO, while DUK experienced losses in this category due to external events.",

Amounts shown represent 100% of the tax-equity project's capacity.\n\n## Year Ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020\n\nCommercial Renewables' results were unfavorable to prior year primarily driven by the impacts from Texas Storm Uri, which resulted in a $35 million pretax loss, as well as lower earnings from unfavorable wind resource and fewer projects financed with tax equity being placed in service in the current year.\n\nOperating Revenues. The variance was primarily driven by a $19 million decrease due to lower wind resource and operating downtime, a $15 million decrease for lower market prices in the current year impacting the wind portfolio, and a $4 million decrease due to fewer distributed energy projects placed into service. This was partially offset by an $8 million increase for market sales in excess of market purchases during Texas Storm Uri and a $6 million increase due to growth of new projects.\n\nOperating Expenses. The variance was primarily due to $49 million for higher operating expenses, depreciation expense and property tax expense as a result of the growth in new projects placed in service since prior year, $31 million increase for higher operating expenses attributed to maintenance at several wind and solar facilities, an $8 million increase for higher engineering and construction costs within the distributed energy portfolio, and a $2 million increase associated with Texas Storm Uri. This was partially offset by a $6 million decrease related to an impairment charge in the prior year for a non-contracted wind project.\n\nOther Income and Expenses, net. The variance was primarily driven by a $29 million loss in equity earnings due to the impacts of Texas Storm Uri.\n\nIncome Tax Benefit. The increase in the tax benefit was primarily driven by an increase in pretax losses partially offset by an increase in taxes associated with tax equity investments and a decrease in PTCs generated.\n\nLoss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The variance was primarily driven by the net increase of losses allocated to tax equity members of $60 million from existing and new projects financed with tax equity, partially offset by a $12 million loss resulting from Texas Storm Uri.",

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\n## Duke E nergy Ohio's and D uke E nergy Indiana's membership in an R TO presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe rules governing the various regional power m arkets m ay change, which could affect D uke E nergy O hio's and D uke E nergy Indiana's costs and/or revenues. Both D uke E nergy Ohio and D uke E nergy Indiana have trackers to recover approved R TO  costs, but to the degree D uke E nergy O hio and D uke E nergy Indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an R T O  that are not approved for recovery, their results of operations m ay be im pacted. D uke E nergy O hio and D uke E nergy Indiana m ay be allocated a portion of the cost of transm ission facilities built by others due to changes in R T O  transm ission rate design, while being able to allocate costs of projects built by D uke E nergy O hio and Duke E nergy Indiana to others. D uke E nergy O hio and D uke E nergy Indiana m ay be required to expand their transm ission system  according to decisions m ade by an R T O  rather than their own internal planning process. In addition, R T O s have been developing rules associated with the allocation and m ethodology of assigning costs associated with im proved transm ission reliability, reduced transm ission congestion and firm  transm ission rights that m ay have a financial im pact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Duke E nergy Ohio and D uke E nergy Indiana.\n\nAs m em bers of an R T O , D uke E nergy O hio and D uke E nergy Indiana are subject to certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation am ong R T O  m em bers, of losses caused by unreim bursed defaults of other participants in the R T O  m arkets not covered by collateral requirem ents and those associated with com plaint cases filed against an RTO that m ay seek refunds of revenues previously earned by R TO  m em bers.\n\n## The Duke E nergy R egistrants may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled.\n\nDuke E nergy's long-term  strategy requires the construction of new projects, either wholly owned or partially owned, which involve a num ber of risks, including construction delays, delays in or failure to receive required regulatory approvals and/or sitting or environm ental perm its, nonperform ance by equipm ent and other third-party suppliers, and increases in equipm ent and labor costs. T o lim it the risks of these construction projects, the D uke E nergy R egistrants enter into equipm ent purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environm ental perm its. If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environm ental perm its, significant cancellation penalties under the equipm ent purchase orders and construction contracts could occur. In addition, if any construction work or investm ents have been recorded as an asset, an im pairm ent m ay need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.\n\n## The Duke E nergy R egistrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.\n\nThe financial condition of som e insurance com panies, actual or threatened physical or cyberattacks, and natural disasters, am ong other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance m arkets. The availability of insurance covering risks that the D uke E nergy R egistrants and their respective com petitors typically insure against m ay decrease, and the insurance that the D uke E nergy R egistrants are able to obtain m ay have higher deductibles, higher prem ium s, and m ore restrictive policy term s. F urther, the insurance policies m ay not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual am ount of loss incurred. Any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance, could adversely affect the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the affected D uke E nergy R egistrant.\n\n## Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.\n\nWhile we strive to m aintain constructive com m unications with our shareholders, activist shareholders m ay, from  tim e to tim e, engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attem pt to affect changes and assert influence on our Board and m anagem ent. P erceived uncertainties as to the future direction or governance of the Company m ay cause concern to our current or potential regulators, vendors or strategic partners, or m ake it m ore difficult to execute on our strategy or to attract and retain qualified personnel, which m ay have a m aterial im pact on our business and operating results.\n\nI n addition, actions such as those described above could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our com m on stock, based on tem porary or speculative m arket perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundam entals and prospects of our business.\n\n## NUCLEAR GE NE R ATION  R ISK S\n\n## Duke E nergy Carolinas, D uke E nergy Progress and D uke E nergy Florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities.\n\nOwnership interests in and operation of nuclear stations by D uke E nergy C arolinas, D uke E nergy P rogress and D uke E nergy F lorida subject them  to various risks. T hese risks include, among other things: the potential harm ful effects on the environm ent and hum an health resulting from  the current or past operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive m aterials; lim itations on the am ounts and types of insurance com m ercially available to cover losses that m ight arise in connection with nuclear operations; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decom m issioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives; and the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of nuclear facilities.\n\nOwnership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires com pliance with licensing and safety-related requirem ents im posed by the N R C . In the event of non-com pliance, the NRC m ay increase regulatory oversight, im pose fines or shut down a unit depending upon its assessm ent of the severity of the situation. R evised security and safety requirem ents prom ulgated by the N R C , which could be prom pted by, am ong other things, events within or outside of the control of D uke E nergy C arolinas, D uke E nergy P rogress and D uke E nergy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as well as assessm ents to cover thirdparty losses. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a m aterial adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation of the D uke E nergy R egistrants.",

A dverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials, internal investigations or in legal claims. Responding to the negative publicity and any resulting investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can divert the time and effort of senior management from NEE's and FPL's business.\n\nAddressing any adverse publicity , governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of NEE and FPL, on the morale and performance of their employees and  on  their  relationships  with  regulators.  It  may   also  hav e  a  negativ e  impact  on  their  ability   to  take  timely   adv antage  of  v arious  business  and  market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity , and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected if F PL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in F lorida.\n\nFPL may negotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in Florida to provide electric services within such municipalities and counties, and electricity   sales generated pursuant to these agreements represent a very substantial portion of FPL's revenues. If FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate such franchise agreements on acceptable terms, it could contribute to lower earnings and FPL may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures, which could adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.\n\nEmployee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue and customers.  Personnel costs may also increase due to inflationary  or  competitiv e  pressures  on  payroll  and  benefits  costs  and  revised  terms  of  collectiv e  bargaining  agreements  with  union  employees.  These consequences could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's ability to successfully identify , complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the energy industry.\n\nNEE is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation of the energy industry . In addition, NEE may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely manner.\n\n## Nuclear Generation Risks\n\nThe operation and maintenance of NEE 's and F PL's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental, health and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks, including, but not limited to, those relating to site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the disposition of spent nuclear fuel, leakage and emissions of tritium and other radioactive elements in the event of a nuclear accident or otherwise, the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of the facilities. NEE and FPL maintain decommissioning funds and external insurance coverage which are intended to reduce the financial exposure to some of these risks; however, the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities could exceed the amount available in NEE's and FPL's decommissioning funds, and the exposure to liability and property damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If NEE or FPL is unable to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or, in the case of FPL, through regulatory mechanisms, their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U .S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in E urope, NE E  and F PL could be assessed significant  retrospective  assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums as a result of their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(*) Based on G eorgia Pow er's ow nership interests.\n\nFor ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power's decommissioning costs are based on the site study and Georgia Power's decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities and the site study estimate for spent fuel management. Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an estimated inflation rate of 4.5% for Plant Farley, 2.5% for Plants Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and 2.3% for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an estimated trust earnings rate of 7.0% for Plant Farley, 4.5% for Plants Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and 4.3% for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\n\nAmounts previously contributed to the Funds for Plant Farley are currently projected to be adequate to meet the decommissioning obligations. Alabama Power's sitespecific estimates of decommissioning costs for Plant Farley are updated every five years. The next site study for Alabama Power is expected to be completed in 2028. Projections of funds are reviewed with the Alabama PSC to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the Funds will provide adequate funding to cover the site-specific costs. If necessary, Alabama Power would seek the Alabama PSC's approval to address any changes in a manner consistent with NRC and other applicable requirements.\n\nUnder the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking in 2022 was a total of $4 million for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Effective January 1, 2023, as approved in the 2022 ARP, there is no annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Any funding amount required by the NRC during the period covered by the 2022 ARP will be deferred to a regulatory asset and recovery is expected to be determined in Georgia Power's next base rate case. See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Rate Plans - 2022 ARP\" for additional information.",

NextEra Energy reports regulatory liabilities tied to pension obligations, with $92 million in unrecognized losses at the end of 2024.

NextEra Energy discloses $845 million in current derivative liabilities, with a significant portion tied to commodity contracts and interest rate derivatives. Southern Company reports $84 million in current derivative liabilities, largely stemming from interest rate and energy-related hedging instruments.

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each quantify or describe the impact of rising fuel costs on their 2022 financial performance, and what does this reveal about their exposure to energy price volatility?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) includes fuel costs in its 'Operations, maintenance and other' expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, indicating that fuel is a direct operational cost. NextEra Energy (NEE) reports a $98 million increase in fuel costs in 2021, which contributed to a $309 million increase in operating expenses - net, highlighting a significant sensitivity to fuel price fluctuations. Southern Company (SO) notes that increases in energy revenues driven by higher natural gas prices are offset by corresponding increases in fuel costs, resulting in no net income impact, suggesting a more insulated position due to cost-recovery mechanisms. Together, this reveals that while all three are exposed to fuel cost volatility, SO's regulatory structure provides a buffer that NEE and DUK do not explicitly reflect in their disclosures.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) conditions common stock dividend declarations on the deferral status of preferred stock dividends, indicating a hierarchical capital distribution policy where preferred stock obligations take precedence. NextEra Energy (NEE) paid $3,024 million in common stock dividends in 2021, reflecting a consistent return of capital to shareholders despite significant capital expenditures and investment activity. Southern Company (SO) consistently allocates cash toward common stock dividends while balancing large-scale infrastructure investments, such as Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and managing debt issuances and repayments. These differences suggest that DUK adopts a more conservative, contingent approach to dividends, NEE maintains a shareholder-friendly policy amid growth investments, and SO integrates dividends within a broader capital structure that includes major construction and financing activities.",

SEVERANCE\n\nDuring 2021, Duke Energy reviewed its operations and identified opportunities for improvement to better serve its customers. This operational review included workforce realignment to ensure the company is staffed with the right skill sets and number of teammates to execute the long-term vision for Duke Energy. As such, Duke Energy extended involuntary severance benefits to certain employees in specific areas as a part of these workforce realignment efforts.\n\nDuring 2020, as a result of partial settlements between Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress deferred as Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, approximately $65 million and $33 million, respectively, of previously recorded severance charges within Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These severance charges were previously recorded during 2018, as Duke Energy reviewed its operations and identified opportunities for improvement to better serve its customers. This operational review included the company's workforce strategy and staffing levels to ensure the company was staffed with the right skill sets and number of teammates to execute the long-term vision for Duke Energy. As such, Duke Energy extended voluntary and involuntary severance benefits to certain employees in specific areas as a part of workforce planning and digital transformation efforts.\n\nThe following table presents the direct and allocated severance and related charges accrued for approximately 290 employees in 2021, 30 employees in 2020 and 140 employees in 2019, by the Duke Energy Registrants within Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n",

The net cash used for financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to debt repayments and redemptions and a return of capital and common stock dividends paid to Southern Company, partially offset by debt issuances and capital contributions from Southern Company.\n\n## Southern Power\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities increased $50 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2021 was primarily related to the acquisition of the Deuel Harvest wind facility and ongoing construction activities. The net cash provided from investing activities in 2020 was primarily related to proceeds from the disposition of Plant Mankato, partially offset by ongoing construction activities and the acquisition of the Beech Ridge II wind facility. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for additional information.\n\nThe net cash used for financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to a return of capital to Southern Company and common stock dividend payments, partially offset by net capital contributions from noncontrolling interests and net issuances of senior notes. The net cash used for financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to the repayment of senior notes at maturity, common stock dividend payments, and net repayments of short-term bank debt and commercial paper, partially offset by net contributions from noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities decreased $544 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to natural gas cost under recovery, reflecting an increase in the cost of gas purchased during Winter Storm Uri, as well as the timing of vendor payments.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to construction of transportation and distribution assets recovered through base rates and infrastructure investment recovered through replacement programs at gas distribution operations, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nThe net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 was primarily related to net issuances of long-term and short-term debt and capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by common stock dividend payments. The net cash provided from financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to proceeds from issuances of senior notes and first mortgage bonds, as well as capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by common stock dividend payments and net repayments of shortterm borrowings.\n\n## Significant Balance Sheet Changes\n\n## Southern Company\n\nSignificant balance sheet changes in 2021 for Southern Company included:\n\n- an increase of $3.7 billion in long-term debt (including securities due within one year) related to new issuances;\n- an increase of $3.5 billion in total property, plant, and equipment primarily related to the Subsidiary Registrants' construction programs (net of pre-tax charges totaling $1.7 billion recorded during 2021 at Georgia Power for estimated probable losses associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4);\n- decreases of $1.8 billion and $0.7 billion in other regulatory assets and employee benefit obligations, respectively, and an increase of $1.7 billion in prepaid pension costs primarily due to actuarial gains related to increases in the assumed discount rates and actual asset returns associated with retirement benefit plans;",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each approach the pension discount rate assumption in their benefit obligation calculations, and what does this reveal about their differing actuarial strategies in managing long-term liabilities?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) used a 2.90% discount rate in 2021 for benefit obligations, showing a relatively stable rate over recent years, suggesting a cautious approach to liability valuation. NextEra Energy (NEE) applied a lower 2.53% discount rate in 2021, down from 3.22% in 2020, indicating a more conservative stance in response to declining interest rates. Southern Company (SO) used a 2.81% discount rate in 2020 across its subsidiaries, showing a moderate approach compared to DUK and NEE. These differences suggest that NEE may be more sensitive to recent market conditions, while DUK maintains a more consistent assumption, and SO adopts a balanced view across its operating units.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy highlights that its ability to recover costs for infrastructure upgrades needed to support renewables and energy storage depends on regulatory approvals and supportive policies, and that failure to secure relicensing of its nuclear reactors could jeopardize its net-zero goals. NextEra Energy emphasizes the risk that the Florida Public Service Commission may disallow recovery of costs deemed imprudent, particularly in relation to fuel procurement and derivative instruments, which could materially affect FPL\u2019s earnings. Southern Company faces uncertainty in cost recovery for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, citing regulatory scrutiny, construction risks, and potential challenges from co-owners or intervenors, which could impact the ultimate recovery of its investment. Together, these perspectives illustrate how each utility faces distinct regulatory hurdles in securing cost recovery for capital-intensive projects, shaped by their specific technologies, regulatory environments, and project risks.",

          "chunk_text": "## BUSINESS STRATEGY RISKS\n\nDuke Energy's future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy including achieving its carbon emissions reduction goals.\n\nDuke Energy's results of operations depend, in significant part, on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully. Duke Energy's clean energy strategy, which includes achieving net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050, modernizing the regulatory construct, transforming the customer experience, and digital transformation, is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control and may make those goals difficult to achieve.\n\nFederal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable Duke Energy to reduce its carbon emissions. Supportive policies may be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transmission and distribution upgrades needed to accommodate the build out of large volumes of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the company to continue to retire existing carbon emitting assets or make investments in new generating capacity. The company may be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on time. In addition, new technologies that are not yet commercially available or are unproven at utility scale will be needed. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early-stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, Duke Energy's ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk.\n\nAchieving our carbon reduction goals will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, may challenge our ability to meet customer expectations of reliability in a carbon constrained environment, Our nuclear fleet is central to our ability to meet these objectives and customer expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond midcentury. Failure to receive approval from the NRC for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050.\n\nAs a consequence, Duke Energy may not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results of its strategy, which may have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\n\n## REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' regulated utility revenues, earnings and results are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke Energy Registrants' regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility commissions, retail electric and natural gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease the Duke Energy Registrants' earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a timely basis, the Duke Energy Registrants' earnings could be negatively impacted. Differences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations, such as North Carolina and South Carolina in Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' service territory, may also result in failure to recover costs.\n\nIf legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the Duke Energy Registrants' exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively impacted. Federal and state regulations, laws, commercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of EE measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in Duke Energy service territories or result in customers leaving the electric distribution system and an increase in customer net energy metering, which allows customers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail amount. Over time, customer adoption of these technologies could result in Duke Energy not being able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation.\n\nState regulators have approved various mechanisms to stabilize natural gas utility margins, including margin decoupling in North Carolina and rate stabilization in South Carolina. State regulators have approved other margin stabilizing mechanisms that, for example, allow for recovery of margin losses associated with negotiated transactions designed to retain large volume customers that could use alternative fuels or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply through their own connection to an interstate pipeline. If regulators decided to discontinue the Duke Energy Registrants' use of tariff mechanisms, it would negatively impact results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, regulatory authorities also review whether natural gas costs are prudently incurred and can disallow the recovery of a portion of natural gas costs that the Duke Energy Registrants seek to recover from customers, which would adversely impact earnings.\n\nThe rates that the Duke Energy Registrants' regulated utility businesses are allowed to charge are established by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings, which may limit their ability to recover costs and earn an appropriate return on investment.\n\nThe rates that the Duke Energy Registrants' regulated utility business are allowed to charge significantly influences the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The regulation of the rates that the regulated utility businesses charge customers is determined, in large part, by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings. Negative decisions made by these regulators, or by any court on appeal of a rate case proceeding, could have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants' results of operations, financial position or cash flows and affect the ability of the Duke Energy Registrants to recover costs and an appropriate return on the significant infrastructure investments being made.",

Risk Factors\n\n## Risks Relating to NEE's and FPL's Business\n\nThe business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond the control of NEE and FPL. These risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or that are currently believed to not be material to the business, may materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL and may cause actual results of NEE and FPL to differ substantially from those that NEE or FPL currently expects or seeks. In that event, the market price for the securities of NEE or FPL could decline. Accordingly, the risks described below should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and in future reports that NEE and FPL file with the SEC.\n\n## Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks\n\nNEE's  and  FPL's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  prospects  may  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  the extensive regulation of their business.\n\nThe  operations  of  NEE  and  FPL  are  subject  to  complex  and  comprehensive  federal,  state  and  other  regulation.  This  extensive  regulatory framework, portions of which are more specifically identified in the following risk factors, regulates, among other things and to varying degrees, NEE's and FPL's industry, businesses, rates and cost structures, operation and licensing of nuclear power facilities, planning, construction and operation  of  electric  generation,  transmission  and  distribution  facilities  and  natural  gas  and  oil  production,  natural  gas,  oil  and  other  fuel transportation, processing and storage facilities, acquisition, disposal, depreciation and amortization of facilities and other assets, decommissioning costs and funding, service reliability, wholesale and retail competition, and commodities trading and derivatives transactions. In their business planning and in the management of their operations, NEE and FPL must address the effects of regulation on their business and any inability or failure to do so adequately could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if they are unable to recover in a timely manner any significant amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise.\n\nFPL operates as an electric utility and is subject to the jurisdiction of the FPSC over a wide range of business activities, including, among other items,  the  retail  rates  charged  to  its  customers  through  base  rates  and  cost  recovery  clauses,  the  terms  and  conditions  of  its  services, procurement  of  electricity  for  its  customers  and  fuel  for  its  plant  operations,  issuances  of  securities,  and  aspects  of  the  siting,  planning, construction and operation of its generation plants and transmission and distribution systems for the sale of electric energy. The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery by FPL of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred and to determine the level of return that FPL is permitted  to  earn  on  invested  capital.  The  regulatory  process,  which  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the  political,  regulatory,  operational  and economic environment in Florida and elsewhere, limits or could otherwise adversely impact FPL's earnings. The regulatory process also does not provide any assurance as to achievement of authorized or other earnings levels, or that FPL will be permitted to earn an acceptable return on capital investments it wishes to make. NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if any material amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital cannot be recovered through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise. Certain other subsidiaries of NEE are utilities subject to the jurisdiction of their regulators and are subject to similar risks.\n\n## Regulatory decisions that are important to NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by political, regulatory, operational and economic factors.\n\nThe local and national political,  regulatory  and  economic  environment  has  had,  and  may  in  the  future  have,  an  adverse  effect  on  regulatory decisions  with  negative  consequences  for  NEE  and  FPL. These  decisions,  which  may  come  from  any  level  of  government,  may  require,  for example, FPL or NEER to cancel or delay planned development activities, to reduce or delay other planned capital expenditures or to pay for investments or otherwise incur costs that it may not be able to recover through rates or otherwise, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.\n\nFPL's use of derivative instruments could be subject to prudence challenges and, if found imprudent, could result in disallowances of cost recovery for such use by the FPSC.\n\nThe FPSC engages in an annual prudence review of FPL's use of derivative instruments in its risk management fuel procurement program and should it find any such use to be imprudent, the FPSC could deny cost recovery for such use by FPL. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",

          "chunk_text": "full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures (e.g., asset retirement costs, property damage reserves, and remaining net book values of retired assets) and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the potential impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Georgia Power, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n- For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by Georgia Power and other interested parties that may impact Georgia Power's future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.\n- We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.\n- We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n- We evaluated Georgia Power's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n## Disclosure of Uncertainties - Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction - Refer to Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Georgia Power Nuclear Construction) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to multiple uncertainties. Such uncertainties include the potential impact of future decisions by Georgia Power's regulators (particularly the Georgia Public Service Commission) and potential actions by the co-owners of the Vogtle project. In addition, Georgia Power's ability to meet its cost and schedule forecasts could impact its ability to fully recover its investment in the project. While the project is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power's cost and schedule forecasts are subject to numerous uncertainties which could impact cost recovery, including ongoing or future challenges with management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; and procurement and related installation. New challenges may arise, particularly as Units 3 and 4 move into initial testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). The ongoing and potential future challenges described above may change the projected schedule and estimated cost.\n\nIn addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities at Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. The ultimate recovery of Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management as well as Georgia Public Service Commission decisions in",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy, NextEra Energy Resources, and Southern Power differ in the way they recognize and report Production Tax Credits (PTCs) from wind energy projects, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies in leveraging renewable energy incentives?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy recognizes PTCs as electricity is produced and records them as a reduction of income tax expense. NextEra Energy Resources recognizes PTCs as wind energy is generated and sold, based on a per kWh rate, and reported $90 million and $150 million in PTCs in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Southern Power reclassifies unused PTCs from current to deferred taxes and reported $6 million, $5 million, and $51 million in PTCs reclassified in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These differences indicate that Duke Energy and NextEra focus on immediate recognition aligned with production and sales, while Southern Power takes a more deferred approach, reflecting varied strategies in managing tax credit monetization and financial reporting impacts.",

          "chunk_text": "Accumulated deferred income taxes are valued using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. In the event of a change in tax rates, deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured as of the enactment date of the new rate. To the extent that the change in the value of the deferred tax represents an obligation to customers, the impact of the remeasurement is deferred to a regulatory liability. Remaining impacts are recorded in income from continuing operations. Duke Energy's results of operations could be impacted if the estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is not reflective of actual outcomes, is modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of a reversal.\n\nTax-related interest and penalties are recorded in Interest Expense and Other Income and Expenses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nSee Note 23 for further information.\n\n## Accounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits\n\nWhen Duke Energy receives ITCs on wind or solar facilities associated with its nonregulated operations, it reduces the basis of the property recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the amount of the ITC and, therefore, the ITC benefit is ultimately recognized in the statement of operations through reduced depreciation expense. Additionally, certain tax credits and government grants result in an initial tax depreciable base in excess of the book carrying value by an amount equal to one half of the ITC. Deferred tax benefits are recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period that the basis difference is created.\n\nDuke Energy receives PTCs on wind facilities that are recognized as electricity is produced and records related amounts as a reduction of income tax expense.\n\n## Excise Taxes\n\nCertain excise taxes levied by state or local governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a gross basis. Taxes for which Duke Energy operates merely as a collection agent for the state and local government are accounted for on a net basis. Excise taxes accounted for on a gross basis within both Operating Revenues and Property and other taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were as follows.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nNEER's interest expense for 2021 decreased approximately $292 million primarily reflecting $251 million of favorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments.\n\n## Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees\n\nNEER recognized $666 million of equity in earnings of equity method investees in 2021 compared to $1,351 million of equity in losses of equity method investees for the prior year. The change for 2021 primarily reflects the absence of an impairment charge related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in 2020 and higher equity in earnings of NEP recorded in 2021 primarily due to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. Due to continued legal and regulatory challenges related to Mountain Valley Pipeline, NextEra Energy Resources also recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of 2022 of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax). See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\n\n## Tax Credits, Benefits and Expenses\n\nPTCs from wind projects and ITCs from solar and certain wind projects are reflected in NEER's earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. Reflected in income taxes in NEE's consolidated statements of income are PTCs totaling approximately $90 million and $150 million and ITCs totaling approximately $237 million and $133 million in  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  A  portion  of  the  PTCs  and  ITCs  have  been  allocated  to  investors  in  connection  with  sales  of  differential membership interests. See Note 1 - Income Taxes for a discussion of PTCs and ITCs and Note 5.\n\n## Corporate and Other: Results of Operations\n\nCorporate and Other at NEE is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to NextEra Energy Resources. Interest expense is allocated  based  on  a  deemed  capital  structure  of  70%  debt  and  differential  membership  interests  sold  by  NextEra  Energy  Resources' subsidiaries.\n\nCorporate and Other's results increased $268 million during 2021 primarily due to favorable after-tax impacts of approximately $370 million, as compared to the prior year, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. The favorable non-qualifying hedge activity was partly offset by higher interest and refinancing costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures (see Note 15 - Commitments), investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses (see Note 6), payment of maturing debt and related derivative obligations (see Note 13 and Note 3) and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors and  sales  of  assets  to  NEP  or  third  parties  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interest), consistent with NEE's and FPL's objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.\n\nIn  October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $150 million of common units representing limited partner interests  in  NEP.  Under  the  program,  purchases  may  be  made  in  amounts,  at  prices  and  at  such  times  as  NEE  or  its  subsidiaries  deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Any purchases will be made in such quantities, at such prices, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as determined by NEE or its subsidiaries in their discretion, based on factors such as market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common unit purchase program does not require NEE to acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated  by  NEE  at  any  time.  The  purpose  of  the  program  is  not  to  cause  NEP's  common  units  to  be  delisted  from  the  New  York  Stock Exchange or to cause the common units to be deregistered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2021, the dollar value of units that may yet be purchased by NEE under this program was $114 million. At December 31, 2021, NEE owned a noncontrolling general partner interest in NEP and beneficially owned approximately 55.0% of NEP's voting power.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy Kentucky, NextEra Energy, and Southern Company each approach the adjustment and regulatory implications of depreciation rates, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies for managing asset lifecycle and regulatory recovery in the utilities sector?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy Kentucky requested adjusted depreciation rates for the East Bend and Woodsdale generation stations to align with a 2035 retirement date, but the KPSC denied this request for East Bend and instead approved a 2041 retirement date. This indicates Duke\u2019s proactive approach to align depreciation with expected asset retirement timelines, though not always successfully. NextEra Energy highlights that if its nuclear facilities are not operated through the end of their licenses, it may be required to increase depreciation rates, incur impairment charges, and accelerate decommissioning expenditures, showing a risk-based and contingency-driven approach to depreciation rate changes. Southern Company conducts periodic depreciation studies, which are filed with state PSCs, and implemented revised depreciation rates effective January 1, 2023, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, reflecting a structured and regulatory-compliant approach to updating depreciation rates. Together, these approaches illustrate varying degrees of proactivity, regulatory engagement, and risk sensitivity in managing depreciation rate adjustments.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Depreciation Rates: Duke Energy Kentucky requested updated depreciation rates tied to a 2035 retirement date for East Bend and Woodsdale, but only received approval for Woodsdale with a 2040 retirement date.",
        "Hop 2: NEE \u2192 Depreciation Rates: NextEra Energy warns that failure to operate nuclear facilities through their license periods could force accelerated depreciation, impairments, and decommissioning costs, indicating a risk-based view of depreciation rate adjustments.",
        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Depreciation Rates: Southern Company conducts periodic depreciation studies and implemented revised rates effective January 1, 2023, showing a systematic and regulatory-aligned approach to depreciation rate updates."

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) references Asset Retirement Obligations in the context of subsequent events and directs readers to Note 10 for detailed disclosures, indicating a procedural but not quantitatively detailed approach in the provided excerpt. NextEra Energy (NEE) explicitly quantifies its ARO liabilities at $2,143 million as of December 31, 2023, showing a clear and material financial commitment tied to asset retirement. Southern Company (SO) defines ARO in its glossary of terms, signaling recognition of the concept but without specific financial figures or contextual usage in operational or financial reporting sections. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three utilities acknowledge AROs, NEE provides the most transparent and concrete financial exposure, whereas DUK and SO offer less direct or quantitative visibility into their ARO profiles.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy reports AFUDC-Equity as a significant line item in its income statement, with $197 million attributed to Duke Energy in 2022, indicating substantial ongoing capital construction projects. NextEra Energy defines AFUDC-Equity in its glossary, highlighting its importance in capturing the equity return on construction financing, which reflects its regulatory treatment and long-term infrastructure investment model. Southern Company discloses AFUDC-Equity as a negative adjustment of (1.5)% in its effective tax rate reconciliation, showing how it impacts tax planning and regulatory cost recovery. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three companies rely on AFUDC-Equity as part of their capital financing strategy, they experience and report it differently based on project scale, regulatory frameworks, and tax implications.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) highlights that its ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs is a key forward-looking risk, indicating that insurance availability directly affects its operational and financial planning. NextEra Energy (NEE) emphasizes that its ability to secure insurance and the terms of such coverage could be materially adversely affected by external events and insurer financial conditions, and notes that it is not fully insured against hurricane-related losses. Southern Company (SO) states that insurance availability is a risk factor, citing potential decreases in availability and increases in deductibles and premiums due to market disruptions, including from physical and cyber threats. Together, these perspectives reveal that all three companies face significant exposure to insurance market volatility, with NEE and SO specifically noting gaps in coverage for major events, while DUK underscores the broader strategic importance of maintaining affordable insurance access.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nChanges in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, NEER's wind and solar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, NEER's results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically, and NEE's results of operations generally, may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. To the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected.\n\nThreats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyberattacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt  NEE's  and  FPL's  business,  or  the  businesses  of  third  parties,  may  materially  adversely  affect  NEE's  and  FPL's  business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE and FPL are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyberattacks and other disruptive  activities  of  individuals  or  groups.  There  have  been  cyberattacks  within  the  energy  industry  on  energy  infrastructure  such  as substations, gas pipelines and related assets in the past and there may be such attacks in the future. NEE's and FPL's generation, transmission and distribution  facilities,  fuel  storage  facilities,  information  technology  systems  and  other  infrastructure  facilities  and  systems  could  be  direct targets of, or otherwise be materially adversely affected by, such activities.\n\nTerrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events affecting NEE's and FPL's systems and facilities, or those of third parties on which NEE and FPL rely, could harm NEE's and FPL's business, for example, by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power, natural gas or other energy-related commodities, by limiting their ability to bill customers and collect and process payments, and by delaying their development and construction  of  new  generation,  distribution  or  transmission  facilities  or  capital  improvements  to  existing  facilities.  These  events,  and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues, significant additional costs (for example, to repair assets, implement additional security requirements or maintain or acquire insurance), significant fines and penalties, and reputational damage, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's operations (for example, by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels), and could impair NEE's and FPL's ability to raise capital (for example, by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity). In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs. Such events or actions may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThe  ability  of  NEE  and  FPL  to  obtain  insurance  and  the  terms  of  any  available  insurance  coverage  could  be  materially  adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEE's and FPL's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses.\n\nInsurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be available at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to NEE and FPL. The ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. If insurance coverage is not available or obtainable on acceptable terms, NEE or FPL may be required to pay costs associated with adverse future events. NEE and FPL generally are not fully  insured  against  all  significant  losses.  For  example,  FPL  is  not  fully  insured  against  hurricane-related  losses,  but  could instead seek recovery of such uninsured losses from customers subject to approval by the FPSC, to the extent losses exceed restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage. A loss for which NEE or FPL is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE invests in gas and oil producing and transmission assets through NEER's gas infrastructure business. The gas infrastructure business is exposed to fluctuating market prices of natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and other energy commodities. A prolonged period of low gas and oil prices could impact NEER's gas infrastructure business and cause NEER to delay or cancel certain gas infrastructure projects and could result in certain projects becoming impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's results of operations.\n\nNatural gas and oil prices are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally. Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, political instability, conflicts, new discoveries, technological advances, economic conditions and actions by major oil-producing countries. There can be significant volatility in market prices for gas and oil, and price fluctuations could have a material  effect  on  the  financial  performance  of  gas  and  oil  producing  and  transmission  assets.  For  example,  in  a  low  gas  and  oil  price environment, NEER would generate less revenue from its gas infrastructure investments in gas and oil producing properties, and as a result certain investments might become less profitable or incur losses. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could also result in the delay or cancellation of oil and gas production and transmission projects, could cause projects to experience lower returns, and could result in certain projects becoming impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's results of operations.",

          "chunk_text": "costs of financing. The discontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual relationships in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets and could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of, and market for the Registrants' and Southern Company Gas Capital's securities and other instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark. Additionally, any replacement benchmark rates may be relatively new, be fundamentally different from LIBOR, and be more volatile than other benchmark or market rates. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate has been identified as the current replacement benchmark rate for LIBOR in the United States. Uncertainty as to the nature of the phase-out of LIBOR and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial markets could cause interest rates to increase. If sources of capital for the Registrants or Nicor Gas are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.\n\n## Failure to comply with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the ability of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas to execute future borrowings.\n\nThe debt and credit agreements of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas contain various financial and other covenants. Georgia Power's loan guarantee agreement with the DOE contains additional covenants, events of default, and mandatory prepayment events relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.\n\n## Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the funding available for nuclear decommissioning.\n\nThe costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, government regulations, and/or life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of the Southern Company system's required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and the Southern Company system could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\" in Item 7 herein and Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Additionally, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each hold significant assets in their nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission their nuclear plants. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the funding available for decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts. See Note 6 to the financial statements under \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## The Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.\n\nThe financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyber attacks, natural disasters, and an increased focus on climate issues, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance may decrease, and the insurance that the Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred.\n\n## The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of the Registrants or in reported net income volatility.\n\nSouthern Company and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure and engage in limited trading activities. The Registrants could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the valuation of these instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable further into the future. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\n\nSee Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each disclose and quantify their asset retirement obligations, and what does this reveal about their relative liabilities and strategic approaches to long-term asset decommissioning costs?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) discusses asset retirement obligations in the context of regulatory proceedings and the uncertainty around cost recovery for coal ash-related retirements, indicating exposure to regulatory risk. NextEra Energy (NEE) reports $3.671 billion in asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2024, showing a growing liability compared to the prior year. Southern Company (SO) discloses $364 million in current asset retirement obligations and $3.694 billion in long-term deferred obligations as of 2024, indicating a significant long-term commitment. These figures suggest that while all three utilities face substantial decommissioning liabilities, NEE and SO have more quantifiably defined long-term obligations, whereas DUK faces greater regulatory uncertainty in recovering these costs through rates.",

In our opinion, the financial statem ents present fairly, in all m aterial respects, the financial position of the C om pany as of D ecem ber 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended D ecem ber 31, 2024, in conform ity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U nited States of Am erica.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statem ents are the responsibility of the C om pany's m anagem ent. O ur responsibility is to express an opinion on the C om pany's financial statem ents based on our audits. W e are a public accounting firm  registered with the P ublic C om pany Accounting O versight Board (U nited States) (P C AO B) and are required to be independent with respect to the C om pany in accordance with the U .S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and E xchange C om m ission and the P C AO B.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the P C AO B. Those standards require that we plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statem ents are free of m aterial m isstatem ent, whether due to error or fraud. T he C om pany is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform , an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the C om pany's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included perform ing procedures to assess the risks of m aterial m isstatem ent of the financial statem ents, whether due to error or fraud, and perform ing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the am ounts and disclosures in the financial statem ents. O ur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estim ates m ade by m anagem ent, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statem ents. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit m atters com m unicated below are m atters arising from  the current-period audit of the financial statem ents that were com m unicated or required to be com m unicated to the audit com m ittee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are m aterial to the financial statem ents and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or com plex judgm ents. T he com m unication of critical audit m atters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statem ents, taken as a whole, and we are not, by com m unicating the critical audit m atters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit m atters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Regulatory Matters - Impact of R ate R egulation on the Financial Statements - R efer to N otes 1, 4, and 10 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Com pany is subject to rate regulation by the N orth C arolina U tilities C om m ission and by the South C arolina P ublic Service C om m ission (collectively the 'C om m issions'), which have jurisdiction with respect to the electric rates of the C om pany. M anagem ent has determ ined it m eets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statem ents under accounting principles generally accepted in the U nited States of Am erica. Judgm ent can be required to determ ine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in custom er rates. As discussed in N ote 4, regulatory proceedings in recent years have focused on the recoverability of storm  costs, fuel costs and asset retirem ent obligations specific to coal ash. As a result, assessing the potential outcom es of future regulatory orders requires m anagem ent judgm ent.\n\nWe identified the im pact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit m atter due to the judgm ents m ade by m anagem ent, including assum ptions regarding the outcom e of future decisions by the C om m issions to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. G iven that m anagem ent's accounting judgm ents are based on assum ptions about the outcom e of future decisions by the C om m issions, auditing these judgm ents required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratem aking process due to its inherent com plexities as it relates to regulatory assets.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, am ong others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of m anagem ent's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates and the m onitoring and evaluation of regulatory developm ents that m ay affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates.\n- We evaluated the C om pany's disclosures related to the im pacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developm ents.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the C om m issions and other publicly available inform ation to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the C om m issions' treatm ent of sim ilar costs under sim ilar circum stances. W e evaluated the external inform ation and com pared it to m anagem ent's recorded balances for com pleteness.\n- For regulatory m atters in process, we inspected the C om pany's and intervenors' filings with the C om m issions that m ay im pact the C om pany's future rates, for any evidence that m ight contradict m anagem ent's assertions.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each account for accretion expense in their 2023 financial disclosures, and what do their respective amounts and changes reveal about their long-term liability management strategies for asset retirement obligations?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) notes that substantially all of its accretion expense relates to regulated operations and is deferred under regulatory accounting. The expense decreased in 2023 due to lower discounted cash flows for nuclear decommissioning and reduced unit costs for ash impoundment closures. NextEra Energy (NEE) reported $154 million in accretion expense for 2023, with $84 million attributed to its subsidiary Florida Power & Light (FPL), showing a steady increase from 2022. Southern Company (SO) recorded $403 million in accretion expense for 2023, with consistent allocation across subsidiaries like Georgia Power and Alabama Power, indicating a stable approach to liability accruals. Collectively, these disclosures suggest varying degrees of cost volatility and regulatory treatment influence in managing long-term retirement obligations.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Accretion Expense: DUK defers accretion expense under regulatory accounting, with 2023 reductions tied to nuclear decommissioning and ash basin closure cost assumptions.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) experienced an $81 million decrease in fuel and purchased power expenses, primarily due to the recovery of fuel costs, despite higher natural gas prices and changes in generation mix. NextEra Energy (NEE) highlights regulatory mechanisms that allow for the recovery of fuel expenses through rate regulation, indicating a structured cost pass-through approach. Southern Company (SO) reported a significant increase in fuel expenses, rising from $470 million in 2020 to $802 million in 2021, directly impacting operating income. Comparing these, DUK and NEE benefit from regulatory frameworks that mitigate fuel cost volatility, while SO experienced a more direct financial impact, suggesting differing cost absorption and regulatory strategies across the three utilities.",

See Note 1 - Rate Regulation.\n\n(c)    Included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets, except for $118 million and $83 million which are related to other generation plant dismantlement and are included in noncurrent regulatory assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n(d)    Represents total amount accrued for ratemaking purposes.\n\nNEER -NEER records liabilities for the present value of its expected nuclear plant decommissioning costs which are determined using various internal  and  external  data  and  applying  a  probability  percentage  to  a  variety  of  scenarios  regarding  the  life  of  the  plant  and  timing  of decommissioning. The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete. At  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  the AROs  for  decommissioning  of  NEER's  nuclear  plants  approximated  $599  million  and $ 637 million, respectively. NEER's portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $9.4 billion, or $2.1 billion expressed in 2021 dollars.\n\nSee  Note  1  -  Asset  Retirement  Obligations  and  -  Decommissioning  of  Nuclear  Plants,  Dismantlement  of  Plants  and  Other  Accrued Asset Removal Costs and Note 11.\n\n## Regulatory Accounting\n\nCertain of NEE's businesses are subject to rate regulation which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation for details regarding NEE's regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nRegulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn (pay) a return on investment during the recovery period.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAccounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. If NEE's rate-regulated entities, primarily FPL, were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the regulators, including the FPSC for FPL, have the authority to disallow recovery of costs that they consider excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&amp;M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when generation facilities are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. The continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period.",

NEE recovers certain environmental-related costs through cost recovery clauses, which are amortized over varying periods, such as 20 years or 21 months depending on the nature of the cost. Southern Company (SO) recovers environmental compliance costs through retail and wholesale rates, with specific mechanisms like Rate CNP Compliance and ECO Plan in place for its subsidiaries, and also seeks cost recovery through PPAs for Southern Power.

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each treat 'Other Regulatory Assets' in their 2024 financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their regulatory strategies and asset management practices in the utilities sector?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reports $83 million under 'Other' in its regulatory assets, reflecting miscellaneous deferred costs or credits subject to regulatory recovery. NextEra Energy (NEE) discloses $4,828 million in regulatory assets under 'Other assets', indicating a significant portion of long-term regulatory-related balances. Southern Company (SO) categorizes $184 million under 'Other regulatory assets' and also shows $180 million in 'Other regulatory liabilities', suggesting a net regulatory position that varies by subsidiary. These differences highlight distinct regulatory recovery strategies and asset management practices across the three utilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Other Regulatory Assets: DUK reports $83 million under 'Other' in its regulatory assets section, indicating smaller-scale or miscellaneous regulatory deferrals subject to recovery.",
        "Hop 2: NEE \u2192 Other Regulatory Assets: NEE reports $4,828 million in regulatory assets under 'Other assets', showing a much larger noncurrent regulatory asset base, possibly reflecting broader regulatory investments or deferrals.",
        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Other Regulatory Assets: SO reports $184 million in 'Other regulatory assets' and $180 million in 'Other regulatory liabilities', indicating a more balanced regulatory asset/liability position with nuanced treatment across its subsidiaries."

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) includes O&M expenses under 'Operations, maintenance and other' in its Consolidated Statements of Operations, indicating a broad treatment of operational costs. NextEra Energy (NEE) explicitly defines O&M expenses as 'other operations and maintenance expenses in the statements of income,' showing a more granular and internally consistent classification. Southern Company (SO) provides forward-looking O&M expense figures under operations and maintenance agreements for Southern Power, projecting $74 million in 2024 and a total of $226 million over the period 2024\u20132028, suggesting a strategic, long-term view of maintenance commitments. Together, these disclosures reflect varying levels of specificity and planning in how each utility manages and reports its O&M costs.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) experienced a $40 million decrease in operating revenues and a $28 million decrease in operating expenses due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers, indicating a direct but partially offsetting impact on revenue. NextEra Energy (NEE) reported that changes in non-qualifying hedge activity \u2014 largely driven by fluctuations in natural gas prices \u2014 contributed to a $364 million decline in net income year-over-year, highlighting significant exposure to gas price volatility through its trading and hedging activities. Southern Company (SO) noted that natural gas prices are a key external factor influencing its ability to meet long-term GHG reduction goals, particularly as it transitions its generation fleet and invests in lower-carbon technologies. Collectively, these perspectives show that while all three utilities are affected by natural gas prices, their exposure manifests differently \u2014 through regulated cost recovery (DUK), market-driven earnings volatility (NEE), and strategic long-term planning (SO).",

T he change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forw ard pow er and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as w ell as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions w ere realized.\n\n(c) For 2023, approximately $300 million of gains are included in FPL's net income; the balance is included in NEER. See Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets for a discussion of the sale of FPL's ownership interest in its Florida City Gas business (FCG).\n\n(b) See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value M easurements for a discussion of impairment charges related to the investment in X PLR in 2024 and 2023.\n\n(d) See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value M easurements for a discussion of the impairment charge in 2022 related to the investment in M ountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (M ountain Valley Pipeline).\n\nNEE segregates into two categories unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative transactions. The first category , referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected or has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to certain of the positions are generally not marked to market. A s a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economicallylinked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GA A P . For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. The second category , referred to as trading activities, which is included in adjusted earnings, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities. A t FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n\n## 2024 Summary\n\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2024 was lower than 2023 by $364 million, or $0.23 per share, assuming dilution, due to lower results at NEER and FPL, partly offset by higher results at Corporate and Other.\n\nFPL's net income decreased by $9 million in 2024 primarily driven by the absence of the gain on sale of FPL's ownership interest in the FCG business in 2023 and a lower earned regulatory ROE in 2024, partly offset by continued investments in plant in service and other property.\n\nNEER's results decreased in 2024 primarily driven by unfavorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2023, partly offset by higher earnings from new investments. In 2024, NEER added approximately 1,365 M W of new wind generating capacity , 2,507 M W of solar generating capacity and 755 M W of battery storage capacity and increased its backlog of contracted renewable development projects.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(*) Includes G HG  emissions attributable to disposed assets through the date of the applicable disposition. S ee Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nSouthern Company system management has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Based on the preliminary 2024 emissions, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 49% since 2007. Although electric generation increased, GHG emissions remained flat in 2024 when compared to 2023 due to an increase in lower carbon generation, including from Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as discussed further under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company - Electricity Business\" herein. While none of Southern Company's subsidiaries are currently subject to renewable portfolio standards or similar requirements, management of the traditional electric operating companies is working with applicable regulators through their IRP processes to continue the generating fleet transition in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders. The natural gas distribution utilities also engage in long-term planning processes in accordance with their state regulatory processes and are investing in programs and efforts to reduce GHG emissions associated with the delivery and use of natural gas, such as advanced leak detection and repair and renewable natural gas. Achievement of these goals is dependent on various factors, many of which the Southern Company system does not control, including load growth across the Southern Company system's service territory, energy policy and regulations, natural gas prices, and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. Southern Company system management plans to continue to economically transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet through a diverse portfolio of resources including low-carbon and carbon-free resources; making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing to implement effective energy efficiency and demand response programs; customer demand for carbon-free energy; implementing initiatives to reduce natural gas distribution emissions; continuing research and development with a focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future. There is no guarantee that the Southern Company system will achieve these goals.\n\n## Environmental Remediation\n\nThe Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in their financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and G eorgia (which represent substantially all of Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Environmental Remediation\" for additional information.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) allocates pension costs to its subsidiary registrants based on employee pensionable earnings and explicitly separates the service cost component for capitalization purposes, while the remaining components are classified as either service cost in Operations, maintenance and other, or nonservice cost in Other income and expenses, net. NextEra Energy (NEE) records the service cost component of net periodic pension income to O&M expense and allocates net periodic pension income to its subsidiaries based on pensionable earnings, with non-service cost classified under other net periodic benefit income. Southern Company (SO) includes the service cost component in operations and maintenance expenses and all other components in other income (expense), net, and changed its method in 2020 to use fair value for liability-hedging securities in calculating the expected return on plan assets. These approaches reveal differences in how each utility manages pension cost recognition, with NEE and SO aligning service cost with operating expenses, while DUK emphasizes capitalization eligibility for service cost. SO\u2019s methodological change in 2020 also reflects a shift toward more timely recognition of asset value changes.",

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\n## DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS\n\nDuke Energy and certain subsidiaries maintain, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The Duke Energy plans cover most employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current eligible earnings, age or age and years of service and interest credits. Certain employees are eligible for benefits that use a final average earnings formula. Under these final average earnings formulas, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to the sum of percentages of their (i) highest three-, four-, or five-year average earnings, (ii) highest three-, four-, or five-year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation (maximum of 35 years) or (iii) highest three-year average earnings times years of participation in excess of 35 years. Duke Energy also maintains, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, nonqualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover certain executives. The qualified and non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit plans are closed to new participants.\n\nDuke Energy uses a December 31 measurement date for its defined benefit retirement plan assets and obligations. Actuarial losses experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan assets as of December 31, 2021, were primarily attributable to actual investment performance that was less than expected investment performance. Actuarial gains experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan obligations as of December 31, 2021, were primarily attributable to the increase in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations. Actuarial gains experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan assets as of December 31, 2020, were attributable to actual investment performance that exceeded expected investment performance. Actuarial losses experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan obligations as of December 31, 2020, were primarily attributable to the decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations.\n\nNet periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below represent the cost of the respective benefit plan for the periods presented prior to capitalization of amounts reflected as Net property, plant and equipment, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Only the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is eligible to be capitalized. The remaining non-capitalized portions of net periodic benefit costs are classified as either: (1) service cost, which is recorded in Operations, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations; or as (2) components of nonservice cost, which is recorded in Other income and expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts presented in the tables below for the Subsidiary Registrants represent the amounts of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost allocated by Duke Energy for employees of the Subsidiary Registrants. Additionally, the Consolidated Statements of Operations of the Subsidiary Registrants also include allocated net periodic benefit costs for their proportionate share of pension and post-retirement benefit cost for employees of Duke Energy's shared services affiliate that provide support to the Subsidiary Registrants. However, in the tables below, these amounts are only presented within the Duke Energy column (except for amortization of settlement charges). These allocated amounts are included in the governance and shared service costs discussed in Note 13.\n\nDuke Energy's policy is to fund amounts on an actuarial basis to provide assets sufficient to meet benefit payments to be paid to plan participants. Duke Energy does not anticipate making any contributions in 2022. The following table includes information related to the Duke Energy Registrants' contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans.\n\n",

Other intangible assets are primarily included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. NEE's other intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense was approximately $25 million, $27 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is expected to be approximately $16 million, $16 million, $18 million, $16 million and $16 million for 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based analysis.  Other  intangible  assets  subject  to  amortization  are  periodically  reviewed  when  impairment  indicators  are  present  to  assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted future cash flows.\n\nPension Plan - NEE records the service cost component of net periodic benefit income to O&amp;M expense and the non-service cost component to other net periodic benefit income in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE allocates net periodic pension income to its subsidiaries based on the pensionable earnings of the subsidiaries' employees. Accounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods  and  that  otherwise  would  be  recorded  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (AOCI)  are  classified  as  regulatory  assets  and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.\n\nStock-Based  Compensation -  NEE  accounts  for  stock-based  payment  transactions  based  on  grant-date  fair  value.  Compensation  costs  for awards with graded vesting are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Forfeitures of stockbased awards are recognized as they occur.

NEE's non-rate regulated subsidiaries recognize such differences in interest expense at the time of retirement.\n\nReference Rate Reform -  In  March  2020,  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  an  accounting  standards  update  which  provides certain options to apply accounting guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting as companies",

The expected return on plan assets is determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Registrants have elected to amortize changes in the market value of return-seeking plan assets over five years and to recognize the changes in the market value of liability-hedging plan assets immediately. Given the significant concentration in return-seeking plan assets, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, Southern Company changed its method of calculating the market-related value of the liability-hedging securities included in its pension plan assets. The market-related value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension cost. Southern Company previously used the calculated value approach for all plan assets, which smoothed asset returns and deferred gains and losses by amortizing them into the calculation of the market-related value over five years. Southern Company changed to the fair value approach for liability-hedging securities, which includes measuring the marketrelated value of that portion of the plan assets at fair value for purposes of determining the expected return on plan assets. The remaining asset classes of plan assets continue to be valued using the calculated value approach. Southern Company considers the fair value approach to be preferable for liability-hedging securities because it results in a current reflection of changes in the value of plan assets in the measurement of net periodic pension cost more consistent with the change in the related obligations.",

(collectively, the 'Parties').\n\nPursuant to the 2021 Settlement, the Parties agreed to a base rate stay-out provision that expires year-end 2024; however, Duke Energy Florida is allowed an increase to its base rates of an incremental $67 million in 2022, $49 million in 2023 and $79 million in 2024, subject to adjustment in the event of tax reform during the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Parties also agreed to an ROE band of 8.85% to 10.85% with a midpoint of 9.85% based on a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt. The ROE band can be increased by 25 basis points if the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate increases 50 basis points or more over a six-month period in which case the midpoint ROE would rise from 9.85% to 10.10%. Duke Energy Florida will also be able to retain the retail portion of the DOE award of approximately $173 million for spent nuclear fuel, which is expected to be received in 2022, in order to mitigate customer rates over the term of the 2021 Settlement. In return, Duke Energy Florida will be able to recognize the $173 million into earnings from 2022 through 2024.\n\nIn addition to these terms, the 2021 Settlement contained provisions related to the accelerated depreciation of Crystal River Units 4-5, the approval of approximately $1 billion in future investments in new cost-effective solar power, the implementation of a new Electric Vehicle Charging Station Program and the deferral and recovery of costs in connection with the implementation of Duke Energy Florida's Vision Florida program, which explores various emerging non-carbon emitting generation technology, distributed technologies and resiliency projects, among other things. The 2021 Settlement also resolved remaining unrecovered storm costs for Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe FPSC approved the 2021 Settlement on May 4, 2021, issuing an order on June 4, 2021. Revised customer rates became effective January 1, 2022, with subsequent base rate increases effective January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company Gas as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe did not audit the financial statements of Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (SNG), Southern Company Gas' investment which is accounted for by the use of the equity method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Southern Company Gas include its equity investment in SNG of $1,129 million and $1,167 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and its earnings from its equity method investment in SNG of $127 million, $129 million, and $141 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose reports (which express unqualified opinions on SNG's financial statements and contain an emphasis of matter paragraph calling attention to SNG's significant transactions with related parties) have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for SNG, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Southern Company Gas' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Southern Company Gas' financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to Southern Company Gas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Southern Company Gas is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Southern Company Gas' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nImpact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Regulatory Assets and Liabilities) and Note 2 (Regulatory Matters - Southern Company Gas) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities (the \"regulated utility subsidiaries\"), which represent approximately 84% of Southern Company Gas' consolidated revenues, are subject to rate regulation in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia by their respective state Public Service Commission or other applicable state regulatory agencies (collectively, the \"Commissions\").

      "question": "How do Duke Energy, NextEra Energy, and Southern Company each assess the impact of fluctuating market prices on their financial performance, and what does this reveal about their exposure to commodity price volatility in the utilities sector?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy highlights that its revenues and margins are significantly influenced by prevailing market prices for electricity and natural gas, especially in competitive power markets where it sells electricity on a contractual basis. These market prices may fluctuate substantially over short periods, impacting its ability to forecast financial outcomes accurately. NextEra Energy, through its subsidiaries, relies heavily on market prices for fair value measurements of its commodity contracts, using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, including forward commodity curves, to value its derivative instruments. This reliance on market pricing data underscores its deep exposure to commodity price volatility. Southern Company notes that under its long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), Southern Power may not be able to execute its business plan if market prices fall below original forecasts, and it may be forced to market assets at lower-than-expected prices.

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each characterize the financial risks associated with nuclear decommissioning costs, and what does this reveal about their respective exposure and mitigation strategies?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) highlights that its nuclear decommissioning funding is tied to the performance of its Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund (NDTF) investments, and a decline in market value could significantly increase funding requirements. NextEra Energy (NEE) acknowledges that decommissioning costs could exceed the available funds in their decommissioning trusts, despite maintaining such funds and external insurance. Southern Company (SO), while not explicitly detailing nuclear decommissioning costs, includes broader environmental compliance and closure costs in its capital expenditure forecasts, which may encompass decommissioning liabilities. Together, these perspectives indicate that all three companies face exposure to rising decommissioning costs, but differ in how they disclose and manage these risks, with DUK emphasizing market-linked funding volatility, NEE highlighting potential underfunding, and SO embedding decommissioning within a broader environmental capital expenditure framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding.\n\nOwnership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected.\n\n## Poor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.\n\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants' proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, could have a material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\n## Duke Energy is a holding company and depends on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\n\nBecause Duke Energy is a holding company with no operations or cash flows of its own, its ability to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock, is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Duke Energy, its subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied. These subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Duke Energy with funds. In addition, Duke Energy may provide capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on Duke Energy's common stock.\n\n## GENERAL RISKS\n\n## The failure of Duke Energy information technology systems, or the failure to enhance existing information technology systems and implement new technology, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses.\n\nDuke Energy's operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, retirees and shareholders and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. Our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers, as well as their respective vendors, many of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future. These providers' systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\nIn addition to maintaining our current information technology systems, Duke Energy believes the digital transformation of its business is key to driving internal efficiencies as well as providing additional capabilities to customers. Duke Energy's information technology systems are critical to costeffective, reliable daily operations and our ability to effectively serve our customers. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions and we must enhance or replace our information technology systems in response. This involves significant development and implementation costs to keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand. If we fail to successfully implement critical technology, or if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands, such failure could materially adversely affect our business strategy as well as impact the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\n## Potential terrorist activities, or military or other actions, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses.\n\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the U.S. Information technology systems, transportation systems for our fuel sources including natural gas pipelines, transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups that could have a material adverse effect on Duke Energy Registrants' businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities, including nuclear power plants under the NRC's design basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident.",

Transactions executed in OTC markets have the potential for greater volatility and less liquidity than transactions on recognized exchanges. As a result, NEE and FPL may not be able to execute desired OTC transactions due to such heightened volatility and limited liquidity.\n\nIn the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of derivative instruments involves management's judgment and use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these derivative instruments and have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity.\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  political  and  public  sentiment  may  result  in  a  significant  amount  of  adverse  press  coverage  and  other  adverse  public statements affecting NEE and FPL. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits,  regardless  of  the  ultimate  outcome  of  the  proceeding,  can  divert  the  time  and  effort  of  senior  management  from  NEE's  and  FPL's business.\n\nAddressing  any  adverse  publicity,  governmental  scrutiny  or  enforcement  or  other  legal  proceedings  is  time  consuming  and  expensive  and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of NEE and FPL, on the morale and performance of  their  employees  and  on  their  relationships  with  regulators.  It  may  also  have  a  negative  impact  on  their  ability  to  take  timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's  and  FPL's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  prospects  may  be  adversely  affected  if  FPL  is  unable  to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in Florida.\n\nFPL may negotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in Florida to provide electric services within such municipalities and counties, and electricity sales generated pursuant to these agreements represent a very substantial portion of FPL's revenues. If FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate such franchise agreements on acceptable terms, it could contribute to lower earnings and FPL may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures, which could adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.\n\nEmployee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue and customers. Personnel costs may also increase due  to  inflationary  or  competitive  pressures  on  payroll  and  benefits  costs  and  revised  terms  of  collective  bargaining  agreements  with  union employees. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the energy industry.\n\nNEE is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation of the energy industry in general. In addition, NEE may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely manner.\n\n## Nuclear Generation Risks\n\nThe operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental, health and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks, including, but not limited to, those relating to site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the disposition of spent nuclear fuel, leakage and emissions of tritium and other radioactive elements in the event of a nuclear accident or otherwise, the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of the facilities. NEE and FPL maintain decommissioning funds and external insurance coverage which are intended to reduce the financial exposure to some of these risks; however, the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities could exceed the amount available in NEE's and FPL's decommissioning funds,",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) notes that adverse economic conditions, including high commodity prices and inflation, could negatively impact the financial stability of its customers, leading to increased bad debt expense and higher allowance for doubtful account reserves. NextEra Energy (NEE) follows the current expected credit loss model, estimating its allowance based on historical bad debt write-off trends, adjusted for current events and forecasts, and recorded $52 million in bad debt expense for 2024. Southern Company (SO), while not providing a detailed narrative, includes its allowance for doubtful accounts in its Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts, indicating a more opaque disclosure approach compared to DUK and NEE. Together, these approaches reveal that DUK emphasizes macroeconomic risk factors, NEE applies a structured, quantitative model with transparent expense reporting, and SO provides minimal qualitative context, suggesting varying levels of emphasis on credit risk visibility and customer receivables management.",

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\nenvironm ental laws or regulations to m ore stringent com pliance levels could, and are likely to, result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or developm ent of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. T he costs to com ply with environm ental laws and regulations could have a m aterial effect on the D uke E nergy Registrants' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe E P A has issued or proposed federal regulations, including the new rules issued in April 2024, governing the m anagem ent of wastewater, C C R  m anagem ent units and C O emissions. N ew state legislation in response to such regulations could im pose carbon reduction goals that are m ore aggressive than the C om pany's plans. T hese regulations m ay require the D uke E nergy R egistrants to m ake additional capital expenditures and increase operating and m aintenance costs. 2\n\n## The Duke E nergy R egistrants' operations, capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes related to the impacts of global climate change.\n\nThere is continued concern, and increasing and conflicting activism , both nationally and internationally, about clim ate change. T he E P A and state regulators have, and m ay adopt and im plem ent, additional regulations to restrict em issions of G H G s to address global clim ate change, as well as reporting requirem ents regarding such em issions and related clim ate-goal claim s. C ertain local and state jurisdictions have also enacted laws to restrict or prevent new natural gas infrastructure. Increased regulation of G H G  em issions and reporting requirem ents could im pose significant additional costs on the D uke E nergy R egistrants' electric and natural gas operations, their suppliers and custom ers and affect dem and for energy conservation and renewable products, which could im pact both our electric and natural gas businesses. R egulatory changes and/or uncertainty of applicability of such legislative and regulatory initiatives could also result in generation facilities to be retired earlier than planned to m eet our net-zero 2050 goal. T hough we would plan to seek cost recovery for investm ents related to G H G  em issions reductions through regulatory rate structures, changes in the regulatory clim ate could result in the delay in or failure to fully recover such costs and investm ent in generation.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n## The Duke E nergy R egistrants' results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control.\n\nSustained downturns or sluggishness in the econom y generally affect the m arkets in which the D uke E nergy R egistrants operate and negatively influence operations. D eclines in demand for electricity or natural gas as a result of econom ic downturns in the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial custom ers reduce production and, therefore, consum ption of electricity and the use of natural gas. Although the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated electric and natural gas businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel and purchased natural gas costs, under periodic adjustm ent clauses, overall declines in electricity or natural gas sold as a result of econom ic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby dim inishing results of operations.\n\nA continuation of adverse econom ic conditions including econom ic downturn or high com m odity prices could also negatively im pact the financial stability of certain of our custom ers and result in their inability to pay for electric and natural gas services. T his could lead to increased bad debt expense and higher allowance for doubtful account reserves for the D uke Energy R egistrants and result in delayed or unrecovered operating costs and lower financial results. Additionally, prolonged econom ic downturns that negatively im pact the D uke Energy R egistrants' results of operations and cash flows could result in future m aterial im pairm ent charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants also m onitor the im pacts of inflation on the procurem ent of goods and services and seek to m inim ize its effects in future periods through pricing strategies, productivity im provem ents, and cost reductions. R apidly rising prices as a result of inflation, tariffs, or other factors m ay im pact the ability of the Company to recover costs tim ely or execute on its business strategy including the achievem ent of growth objectives.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants sell electricity into the spot m arket or other com petitive power m arkets on a contractual basis. W ith respect to such transactions, the D uke E nergy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investm ents through m andated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing m arket prices. T hese m arket prices m ay fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of tim e and could negatively im pact the C om pany's ability to accurately forecast the financial im pact or reduce the D uke E nergy R egistrants' revenues and m argins, thereby dim inishing results of operations.\n\nFactors that could im pact sales volum es, generation of electricity and m arket prices at which the D uke E nergy R egistrants are able to sell electricity and natural gas are as follows:\n\n- weather conditions, including extrem e winter or sum m er weather that could cause significantly lower or higher dem and for energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purposes, as applicable, storm -related custom er outages resulting in lower usage, or periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an econom ical m anner;\n- supply of and dem and for energy com m odities, including potential usage of electricity by data centers;\n- transm ission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;\n- availability of purchased power;\n- availability of com petitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by som e custom ers over electricity produced from  coal, nuclear or natural gas plants, and custom er usage of energy-efficient equipm ent that reduces energy dem and;\n- natural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices;\n- ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, including m aterials, supplies, and fuel such as coal, natural gas and uranium ; and\n- capacity and transm ission service into, or out of, the D uke E nergy R egistrants' m arkets.",

Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses are recognized in income and are reinvested in the funds. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\n\nMajor M aintenance Costs - FPL expenses costs associated with planned maintenance for its non-nuclear electric generation plants as incurred. FPL recognizes costs associated with planned major nuclear maintenance in accordance with regulatory treatment. FPL defers nuclear maintenance costs for each nuclear unit's planned outage to a regulatory asset as the costs are incurred. FPL amortizes the costs to O&amp;M  expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\n\nNEER uses the deferral method to account for certain planned major maintenance costs. NEER's major maintenance costs for its nuclear generation units, combustion turbines and battery storage are capitalized (included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets) and amortized to O&amp;M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\n\nCash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of generally three months or less.\n\nRestricted Cash - A t  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  NEE  had  approximately  $159  million  ($101  million  for  FPL)  and  $730  million  ($15  million  for  FPL), respectively , of restricted cash, which, at December 31, 2024, was offset by $244 million of cash received on exchange-traded derivative positions resulting in a balance of $(85) million. Restricted cash accounts are included in current other assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and primarily relate to debt service payments and margin cash collateral requirements (funding) at NEER and bond proceeds held for construction at FPL. In addition, where offsetting positions exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral of $279 million is netted against derivative assets at December 31, 2024 and $194 million is netted against derivative assets and $815 million is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2023. See Note 3.\n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses - NEE, including FPL, follows the current expected credit loss model to account for credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes customer accounts receivable. FPL maintains an accumulated provision for uncollectible customer accounts receivable that is estimated using a percentage derived from historical revenue and write-off trends, adjusted for current events and forecasts. NEER regularly reviews collectibility  of its receiv ables and establishes a provision for losses estimated as a percentage of accounts receivable based on the historical bad debt write-off trends, adjusted for current events and forecasts. When necessary , NEER uses the specific identification method for all other receivables. NEE's credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates using established standards and credit quality indicators such as credit ratings, certain financial ratios and delinquency trends. NEE requires credit enhancements or secured payment terms from customers who do not meet the minimum criteria.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, NEE recorded approximately $52 million, $77 million and $113 million, respectively , of bad debt expense, including credit losses, which are included in O&amp;M  expenses in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n\nInventory - FPL values materials, supplies and fuel inventory using a weighted-average cost method. NEER's materials, supplies and fuel inventories, which include emissions allowances and renewable energy credits, are carried at the lower of weighted-average cost and net realizable value, unless evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost will be recovered with a normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of business.\n\nEnergy Trading - NEE provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load-following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to optimize the value of electricity and fuel contracts, generation facilities  and  natural  gas  and  oil  production  assets,  as  well  as  to  take  adv antage  of  projected  fav orable  commodity   price  mov ements.  Trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for at fair value and realized gains and losses from all trading contracts, including those where physical delivery is required, are recorded net for all periods presented. See Note 3.\n\nStorm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery - The storm funds provide coverage toward FPL's storm damage costs. M arketable securities held in the storm funds are carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding adjustment to the storm reserve. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes. The storm funds are included in special use funds and the storm reserves in noncurrent regulatory liabilities or, in the case of a deficit, in regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each reflect the financial and operational dynamics of cost recovery in their 2023 disclosures, and what does this reveal about the role of regulatory frameworks in shaping their utility business models?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) emphasizes that its revenue structure is designed to support the recovery of prudently incurred costs and an appropriate return on invested assets, primarily governed by published tariff rates or contractual agreements approved by regulatory bodies. This indicates a strong alignment with cost recovery mechanisms embedded in regulated utility tariffs. NextEra Energy (NEE) notes that at Florida Power & Light (FPL) and other businesses where cost recovery is available, the recovery of costs related to service restoration or infrastructure repair after severe weather events is subject to regulatory approval, highlighting the conditional nature of cost recovery in practice. Southern Company (SO) quantifies the negative impact of gas costs and other cost recovery adjustments at $1.323 billion in its 2023 operating revenues, directly showing how cost recovery mechanisms can reduce reported revenue despite underlying cost increases. Together, these perspectives illustrate that while cost recovery is a foundational element of utility financial models, its effectiveness is highly dependent on regulatory environments and can be significantly influenced by external events such as weather disruptions or commodity price fluctuations.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Cost Recovery: DUK explicitly states that its stand-alone selling prices are designed to support recovery of prudently incurred costs and an appropriate return on invested assets, governed by tariff rates or regulatory approvals.",
        "Hop 2: NEE \u2192 Cost Recovery: NEE notes that cost recovery for storm restoration and infrastructure repair is subject to regulatory approval, indicating that recovery is not automatic and depends on regulatory discretion.",
        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Cost Recovery: SO quantifies a $1.323 billion negative impact from gas costs and other cost recovery adjustments on its 2023 operating revenues, showing how cost recovery can reduce reported revenues despite rising costs."

      "question": "How did Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each manage the financial impacts of fluctuating fuel prices in 2023, and what does this reveal about their cost recovery mechanisms and exposure to commodity volatility?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) actively managed rising fuel costs in 2022 by working with regulators to extend recovery periods, and by 2023 had recovered $1.5 billion in deferred fuel costs, anticipating alignment with historical averages by 2024. NextEra Energy (NEE) experienced a $714 million decrease in fuel cost recovery revenues in 2023 due to lower fuel and energy prices, which contributed to a net decrease in under-recovery of cost recovery clauses by approximately $1,104 million. Southern Company (SO) noted that volatility in natural gas prices significantly impacts customer rates, long-term competitiveness, and earnings variability, particularly in its gas marketing services, with exposure to commodity price swings driven by supply constraints and geopolitical events. Together, these companies demonstrate varied approaches to managing fuel price exposure, with DUK focusing on regulatory deferrals, NEE benefiting from lower prices, and SO emphasizing structural exposure and market sensitivity.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Fuel Prices: DUK managed volatile fuel prices in 2022 by extending recovery periods with regulators and recovered $1.5 billion in deferred fuel costs by 2023, expecting to normalize balances by 2024.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy reported $8,288 million in operating revenues for 2023, with fuel and purchased power costs accounting for $2,524 million. NextEra Energy reported significantly higher consolidated operating revenues of $28,114 million, with FPL contributing $18,365 million and NEER contributing $9,672 million, and total operating expenses of $18,282 million. Southern Company reported total gross revenues of $3,971 million, with operating revenues of $188 million after subtracting gas costs of $3,783 million. These figures highlight NEE's larger scale and diversified business structure, DUK's mid-sized integrated utility model, and SO's smaller operating revenue base relative to gross revenues due to gas cost pass-throughs.",

NextEra Energy (NEE) provides forward-looking AFUDC estimates across multiple project categories, including $135 million in 2024 and $145 million in 2028 for certain projects, and $95 million in 2023 declining to $65 million in 2027 in another category. Southern Company (SO) discloses $440 million of expected AFUDC financing costs related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with $417 million already accrued by December 31, 2023. These figures indicate varying scales and timelines of capital investment and financing strategies, with NEE showing multi-year visibility across multiple projects, SO focusing on a major nuclear initiative, and DUK referencing a smaller, more specific component within a broader context.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each incorporate AFUDC into their capital expenditure planning and regulatory recovery strategies, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to financing long-term infrastructure projects?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) defines AFUDC as an 'Allowance for funds used during construction' in its glossary of terms, indicating its recognition as a standard financial mechanism in utility construction projects, though it does not provide specific dollar figures or regulatory recovery strategies. NextEra Energy (NEE) quantifies AFUDC across multiple years (e.g., $115 million in 2025, increasing to $175 million in 2028), integrating it directly into its capital expenditure forecasts for renewable and transmission projects. Southern Company (SO) explicitly ties AFUDC to regulatory recovery mechanisms, particularly for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, where AFUDC was used to finance costs above $4.418 billion up to $7.562 billion and is now being recovered through retail rates over the life of the units. These differences highlight that DUK treats AFUDC as a definitional item without detailed strategic linkage, NEE embeds AFUDC in forward-looking capital planning, and SO aligns AFUDC directly with regulatory-approved cost recovery frameworks for major nuclear assets.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nand the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allowed Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs were recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. Financing costs related to capital costs above $4.418 billion up to $7.562 billion approved for recovery as described below were recognized through AFUDC and are being recovered through retail rates over the life of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4; however, G eorgia Power did not record AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of $7.562 billion. In 2022, the G eorgia PSC approved Georgia Power's filing to increase the NCCR tariff by $36 million annually, effective January 1, 2023. In November 2023, Georgia Power filed a request to continue for 2024 the NCCR tariff that was effective during 2023. The staff of the Georgia PSC accepted the proposal and no further approval from the Georgia PSC was required. See additional information below on AFUDC and the NCCR tariff following commercial operation of Unit 4.\n\nIn 2021, the Georgia PSC approved an order under which Georgia Power would include in rate base an allocation of $2.1 billion to Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and the Common Facilities from the $3.6 billion of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 costs previously deemed prudent by the Georgia PSC and would recover the related depreciation through retail base rates effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. In compliance with the G eorgia PSC order, G eorgia Power increased annual retail base rates by $318 million effective August 1, 2023 based on the in-service date of July 31, 2023 for Unit 3. The related increase in annual retail base rates included recovery of all projected operations and maintenance expenses for Unit 3 and the Common Facilities and other related costs of operation, partially offset by the related PTCs. Financing costs (debt and equity) on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the Common Facilities construction costs continued to be recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia Power deferred as a regulatory asset the debt component of financing costs as well as the remaining depreciation until Unit 4 costs were placed in retail base rates as described below. The regulatory assets for the debt component of financing costs and depreciation are being recovered over 10 years beginning May 2024, as approved by the Georgia PSC, with a remaining balance of $23 million and $29 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. The equity component of financing costs ($39 million at December 31, 2024) represents an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on Georgia Power's balance sheets. This amount will be recognized in Georgia Power's income statements in the periods it is billable to customers.\n\nIn December 2023, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's application to adjust rates to include reasonable and prudent Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 costs as modified by the related stipulation (Prudency Stipulation) among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors.\n\nUnder the terms of the approved Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power will recover $7.562 billion in total construction and capital costs and associated retail rate base items of $1.02 billion, which includes AFUDC financing costs above $4.418 billion (the Georgia PSC-certified amount) up to $7.562 billion. Georgia Power will also recover projected operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, nuclear decommissioning accruals, and property taxes, net of projected PTCs. After considering construction and capital costs already in retail base rates of $2.1 billion and $362 million of associated retail rate base items for Unit 3 and Common Facilities (approved by the Georgia PSC in 2021), Georgia Power included in retail rate base the remaining $5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as $647 million of associated retail rate base items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4. Annual retail base revenues increased approx imately $730 million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately 5% (net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.\n\nReductions to the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (pursuant to prior Georgia PSC orders) negatively impacted earnings by approximately $80 million through the second quarter 2024 and $310 million and $300 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Further, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since commercial operation for Unit 4 was not achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April 1, 2024, which resulted in a negative impact to earnings of approximately $10 million (for one month) in the second quarter 2024 based on the April 29, 2024 inservice date. Effective May 1, 2024, following commercial operation of Unit 4, Georgia Power's NCCR tariff was eliminated and financing costs are included in Georgia Power's general retail revenue requirements. Financing costs of $10 million that were not recovered through the NCCR tariff will be addressed in Georgia Power's next retail base rate case proceeding.\n\nAs of each Unit's respective first refueling outage, if the respective Unit's performance has materially deviated from ex pected performance, the Georgia PSC may order Georgia Power to credit customers for operations and maintenance expenses or disallow costs associated with the repair or replacement of any system, structure, or component found to have caused the material deviation in performance if proven to be the result of imprudent engineering, construction, procurement, testing, or start-up. Unit 3 demonstrated high performance and reliability during the first 14 months of operation leading up to its first refueling outage, which took place in the fall of 2024 and no performance-related disallowance is expected. Unit 4 has also demonstrated high performance and reliability since being placed in service and its first refueling outage is projected to begin in the fall of 2025. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each account for their asset retirement obligations (AROs), and what does this reveal about their respective exposure to decommissioning and dismantlement liabilities in regulated and non-regulated operations?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reported AROs of $173 million in 2021, primarily reflecting long-term obligations tied to regulated utility operations. NextEra Energy (NEE) disclosed that its AROs are primarily related to decommissioning obligations for nuclear units at Florida Power & Light (FPL) and NEER, as well as dismantlement of wind and solar facilities, with a rollforward indicating ongoing regulatory timing differences in cost recognition. Southern Company (SO) reported significantly higher AROs of $3,100 million in 2021, with major components tied to its regulated subsidiaries, particularly Georgia Power ($1,819 million) and Alabama Power ($1,192 million), indicating a more substantial exposure to long-term decommissioning liabilities. This comparison reveals that while all three companies manage AROs, SO carries a disproportionately larger burden, likely due to its broader portfolio of regulated generation assets requiring long-term retirement planning.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nNEE's  ROU  assets  obtained  in  exchange  for  operating  lease  obligations  totaled  approximately  $92  million,  $121  million  and  $450  million, respectively, and in 2019 primarily relate to leases acquired with the Gulf Power ($262 million at FPL) and Trans Bay acquisitions (see Note 6). Other operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income for the periods presented.\n\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to a natural gas and oil electric generation facility and certain battery storage facilities that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NEE recorded a net investment in sales-type leases of approximately $42 million and $47 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2024 to 2043 and NEE expects to receive approximately $843 million of lease payments over the remaining terms of the power sales agreements with no one year being material. Operating and sales-type lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income for the periods presented.\n\n## 11. Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nNEE's AROs relate primarily  to  decommissioning  obligations  of  FPL's  and  NEER's  nuclear  units  and  to  obligations  for  the  dismantlement  of certain  of  NEER's  wind  and  solar  facilities.  For  NEE's  rate-regulated  operations,  including  FPL,  the  accounting  provisions  result  in  timing differences in the recognition of legal asset retirement costs for financial reporting purposes and the method the regulator allows for recovery in rates.

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each reflect the composition and volatility of their 2023 operating revenues, particularly in terms of regulated vs. nonregulated activities and derivative impacts, and what does this reveal about their respective business models?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reported total operating revenues of $1,628 million in 2023, with $1,603 million coming from regulated natural gas and only $25 million from nonregulated natural gas and other activities, indicating a strong reliance on stable, regulated revenue streams. Southern Company (SO) generated $4,702 million in total operating revenues in 2023, with $4,105 million from regulated distribution operations and $548 million from gas marketing services, showing a more diversified mix with a significant nonregulated component. In contrast, NextEra Energy (NEE) included $1,482 million in unrealized gains from Level 3 derivative transactions within its operating revenues, highlighting a more complex and market-sensitive revenue structure influenced by energy trading and derivatives. This comparison reveals that DUK maintains the most stable revenue model through regulation, SO balances regulated and nonregulated gas services, and NEE exhibits higher exposure to market volatility through its derivative activities.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy Florida (DUK), Florida Power & Light (NEE), and Georgia Power (SO) each approach base rate adjustments and cost recovery mechanisms in light of regulatory settlements and compliance obligations, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies for managing rate impacts on customers through 2025?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy Florida (DUK) has a structured base rate increase schedule through 2024 under the 2021 Settlement, with $49 million in 2023 and $79 million in 2024, while also managing rate impacts through flow-back mechanisms tied to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) PTCs, which led to a $56 million rate reduction in 2023. Florida Power & Light (NEE) operates under a 2021 rate agreement that established new retail base rates effective from January 2022 through December 2025, including a $692 million increase effective January 1, 2022, with cost recovery clauses covering storm protection and solar investments. Georgia Power (SO) under the 2022 ARP will adjust base rates effective January 1, 2025, with cost recovery for CCR ARO compliance costs of $300 million in 2023, $305 million in 2024, and $330 million in 2025, amortized over four-year periods. Synthesizing these, DUK emphasizes phased rate increases and tax credit pass-throughs, NEE focuses on long-term rate stability with broad cost recovery mechanisms, and SO plans for future rate adjustments tied to environmental compliance costs.",

Southern Company emphasizes its need to satisfy environmental performance standards and the requirements of tax credits and other incentives to construct and integrate new facilities, suggesting a compliance-driven strategy where incentives are conditional on meeting regulatory benchmarks.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\n## Risks Relating to NEE's and FPL's Business\n\nThe business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond the control of NEE and FPL. These risks, whether or not expressly stated with respect to any particular risk factor, as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or that are currently believed to not be material to the business, may materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL and may cause actual results of NEE and FPL to differ substantially from those that NEE or FPL currently expects or seeks. In that event, the market price for the securities of NEE or FPL could decline. A ccordingly , the risks described below should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and in future reports that NEE and FPL file with the SEC.\n\n## Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks\n\n## NEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their business.\n\nThe operations of NEE and FPL are subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulation. This extensive regulatory framework, portions of which are more specifically identified in the following risk factors, regulates, among other things and to varying degrees, NEE's and FPL's industry , businesses, operations, and rates and cost structures, including: permitting, planning, construction and operation of electric generation, storage, transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas, oil and other fuel production, transportation, processing and storage facilities; acquisitions, disposals, depreciation and amortization of facilities and other assets; decommissioning costs and funding; service reliability; wholesale and retail competition; and commodities trading and derivatives transactions. In their business planning and in the management of their operations, NEE and FPL must address the effects of regulation on their business and any inability  or failure to do so adequately  could hav e a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if they are unable to recover in a timely manner any significant amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise.\n\nFPL operates as an electric utility and is subject to the jurisdiction of the FPSC over a wide range of business activities, including, among other items, the retail rates charged to its customers through base rates and cost recovery clauses, the terms and conditions of its services, procurement of electricity for its customers and fuel for its plant operations, issuances of securities, and aspects of the siting, planning, construction and operation of its generation plants and transmission and distribution systems for the sale of electric energy . The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery by FPL of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred, including those incurred to transition to lower carbon emission technology , and to determine the level of return that FPL is permitted to earn on invested capital. The regulatory process, which may be adversely affected by the geopolitical, political, regulatory , operational and economic environment in Florida and elsewhere, limits or could otherwise adversely impact FPL's earnings. The regulatory process also does not provide any assurance as to achievement of authorized or other earnings levels, or that FPL will be permitted to earn an acceptable return on capital investments it wishes to make. NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if any material amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital cannot be recovered through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise. Certain other subsidiaries of NEE are utilities subject to the jurisdiction of their regulators and are subject to similar risks.\n\n## Regulatory decisions that are important to NEE and F PL may be materially adversely affected by political, regulatory, operational and economic factors.\n\nThe local and national political, regulatory and economic environment has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on regulatory decisions with negative consequences for NEE and FPL. These decisions, which may come from any level of government, including through actions taken, or not taken, by government agencies as a result of executive orders, may require, for example, FPL or NEER to cancel or delay planned development activities, to reduce or delay other planned capital expenditures or to pay for investments or otherwise incur costs that it may not be able to recover through rates or otherwise, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.\n\nAny reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support clean energy , including, but not limited to, tax laws, policies and incentives, RPS and feed-in-tariffs, or the imposition of additional taxes, tariffs, duties or other costs or assessments on clean energy or the equipment necessary to generate, store or deliver it, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new clean energy projects, NEE and F PL abandoning the development of clean energy projects, a loss of investments",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy, NextEra Energy, and Southern Company compare in terms of their audit fee disclosures for 2021, and what does this reveal about the scope and nature of their audit engagements?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy reported total audit fees of $13.2 million for 2021, with specific breakdowns across its subsidiaries, indicating a distributed audit structure. NextEra Energy disclosed $3.834 million in audit fees for the same year, significantly lower than Duke\u2019s total, suggesting a more centralized or less complex audit engagement. Southern Company provided a more qualitative description of its audit fees without a total dollar figure, emphasizing the scope of services such as statutory audits, internal control reviews, and green bond expenditures. Together, these disclosures reflect varying levels of detail and complexity in audit activities across the three major utility companies.",

NextEra Energy discloses $1,421 million in regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2021, primarily tied to its Florida Power & Light subsidiary, which had $1,397 million in such liabilities, indicating a significant regulatory burden in its core market. Southern Company, while not providing a total figure, highlights that its regulatory liabilities include unrecognized costs related to postretirement benefit plans across its traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas, signaling deferred recognition of these obligations in earnings. Together, these disclosures show varying degrees of regulatory liability exposure, with Duke and NextEra recognizing substantial liabilities tied to legacy obligations, while Southern defers recognition of certain postretirement costs.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reported an add of $344 million related to losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2021, which positively impacted its segment income despite an overall operating loss. NextEra Energy (NEE) experienced a comprehensive loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $747 million in 2021, reflecting a significant negative impact on its comprehensive income. Southern Company (SO), in contrast, reported a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $99 million in 2021, indicating a relatively smaller negative effect on its consolidated net income. These figures reveal differing magnitudes and directions of noncontrolling interest impacts across the three utilities, with DUK benefiting from noncontrolling losses, NEE facing the largest burden, and SO experiencing a moderate negative effect.",

NextEra Energy (NEE), through its subsidiary Florida Power & Light (FPL), relies on a diversified fuel mix including purchased power to maintain flexibility and achieve a more economical fuel strategy. Southern Company (SO) reports specific purchased power expenses of $26 million in 2021, a relatively small portion of its total operating expenses, indicating a more internally generated fuel strategy.

At December 31, 2021, FPL had the following significant fuel and transportation contracts in place:\n\n- firm  transportation  contracts  with  six  different  transportation  suppliers  for  natural  gas  pipeline  capacity  for  an  aggregate  maximum delivery quantity of 2,916,000 MMBtu/day with expiration dates through 2042 (see Note 15 - Contracts);\n- several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates through 2037; and\n- short- and medium-term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of FPL's anticipated needs for natural gas. The remainder of FPL's natural gas requirements is purchased in the spot market.\n\n## Nuclear Operations\n\nAt December 31, 2021, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated the four nuclear units in Florida discussed below. FPL's nuclear units  are  periodically  removed  from  service  to  accommodate  planned  refueling  and  maintenance  outages,  including  inspections,  repairs  and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time.\n\n",

NextEra Energy reported a significantly higher Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests of $746 million in 2021, suggesting a more substantial minority interest exposure, potentially tied to its broader portfolio of joint ventures or subsidiaries. Southern Company, in contrast, reported a Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests of -$99 million in 2021, indicating a net gain from noncontrolling interests, which may reflect different ownership structures or minority partner contributions during the year.

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each manage the financial impact of fluctuating fuel costs, and what does this reveal about their regulatory and operational strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) defers fuel costs as regulatory assets, with management making assumptions about future recovery in customer rates, particularly in regulatory proceedings focused on storm costs and coal ash-related expenses. NextEra Energy (NEE) recovers fuel, purchased power, and interchange expenses through cost recovery clauses, deferring net under-recovery or over-recovery to match costs with revenues in subsequent periods. Southern Company (SO) experienced a $81 million decrease in wholesale revenues due to lower system fuel and purchased power costs, with changes in energy revenues largely offset by corresponding changes in fuel costs. These approaches reflect differing regulatory mechanisms and cost management strategies across the three utilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Fuel Costs: DUK treats fuel costs as regulatory assets, with management making assumptions about future recovery in customer rates, particularly in regulatory proceedings focused on storm costs and coal ash-related asset retirement obligations.",
        "Hop 2: NEE \u2192 Fuel Costs: NEE recovers fuel, purchased power, and interchange expenses through cost recovery clauses, deferring any under-recovery or over-recovery to be collected from or returned to customers in subsequent periods, aligning revenues with associated costs.",
        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Fuel Costs: SO experienced a $81 million decrease in wholesale revenues due to lower Southern Company system fuel and purchased power costs, with the impact on net income being minimal since increases or decreases in energy revenues are generally accompanied by corresponding changes in fuel costs."

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) recorded ARO liabilities based on estimated closure costs for coal ash impoundments under the 2024 CCR Rule, with adjustments expected as closure methods and regulatory approvals evolve. NextEra Energy (NEE) recognizes AROs primarily for nuclear decommissioning and wind/solar dismantlement, with changes in estimates affecting regulatory assets or liabilities systematically over time. Southern Company (SO) experienced both increases and decreases in ARO liabilities, including a $389 million decrease following updated decommissioning studies and a $175 million decrease related to the CCR Rule due to revised inflation and timing assumptions. These differences highlight how each utility manages regulatory risk and updates financial exposure in response to evolving federal and state requirements.",

T herefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. D uring 2019, D uke E nergy F lorida entered into an agreem ent for the accelerated decom m issioning of C rystal R iver U nit 3. R egulatory approval was received from  the N R C  and the F P SC  in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively.\n\n## Closure of Ash Impoundments\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants are subject to state and federal regulations covering the closure of coal ash im poundm ents, including federal C C R  rules and the C oal Ash Act, and other agreem ents. In April 2024, the E P A issued the 2024 C C R  R ule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 C C R  R ule by establishing regulatory requirem ents for inactive surface im poundm ents at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. AR O s recorded on the D uke E nergy R egistrants' C onsolidated Balance Sheets include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of these regulations and agreem ents.\n\nThe ARO am ount recorded on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets is based upon estim ated closure costs for im pacted ash im poundm ents. The am ount recorded represents the discounted cash flows for estim ated closure costs based upon specific closure plans. Actual costs to be incurred will be dependent upon factors that vary from  site to site. T he m ost significant factors are the m ethod and tim e fram e of closure at the individual sites. C losure m ethods considered include rem oving the water from  ash basins, consolidating m aterial as necessary and capping the ash with a synthetic barrier. The ultim ate m ethod and tim etable for closure will be in com pliance with standards set by federal and state regulations and other agreem ents. The AR O  am ount will be adjusted as additional inform ation is gained through the closure and post-closure process, including acceptance and approval of compliance approaches, which m ay change m anagem ent assum ptions, and m ay result in a m aterial change to the balance. See the AR O  Liability R ollforward section below for inform ation on revisions m ade to the coal ash liability during 2024 and 2023.\n\nAsset retirem ent costs associated with the AR O s for operating plants and retired plants are included in N et property, plant and equipm ent and R egulatory assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See N ote 4 for additional inform ation on R egulatory assets related to AR O s and N ote 5 for additional inform ation on com m itm ents and contingencies.\n\nCost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the norm al ratem aking process with federal and state utility com m issions, which perm it recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with D uke E nergy's regulated operations.

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\neffectiv e rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&amp;M , depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses.  In general, the net impact of these income statement line items is adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization or its reversal to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. See Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 above.\n\nNEER's electric plant in service and other property less salvage value, if any , are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over their estimated useful liv es. NEER reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. NEER's natural gas and oil production assets are accounted for under the successful efforts method. Depletion expenses for the acquisition of reserve rights and development costs are recognized using the unit of production method. Depreciation of  NEER's rate-regulated transmission assets are provided on a straight-line basis, primarily over their average remaining useful life.  NEER includes  in  depreciation  expense  a  provision  for  dismantlement,  interim  asset  removal  costs  and  accretion  related  to  asset  retirement  obligations.  For substantially all of NEER's rate-regulated transmission assets, depreciation studies are performed periodically and filed with FERC which result in updated depreciation rates.\n\nNuclear Fuel - FPL and NEER have several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel. See Note 15 Contracts. FPL's and NEER's nuclear fuel costs are charged to fuel expense on a unit of production method.\n\nConstruction Activity - A llowance for funds used during construction (A FUDC) is a noncash item which represents the allowed cost of capital, including an ROE, used to finance construction projects. FPL records the portion of A FUDC attributable to borrowed funds as a reduction of interest expense and the remainder as other income. FPSC rules limit the recording of A FUDC to projects that have an estimated cost in excess of 0.4% of a utility's plant in service balance and require more than one year to complete. FPSC rules allow construction projects below the applicable threshold as a component of rate base.\n\nFPL's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, engineering costs, AFUDC and other costs directly associated with the construction of various projects. Upon completion of the projects, these costs are transferred to electric utility plant in service and other property. Capitalized costs associated with construction activities are charged to O&amp;M  expenses when recoverability is no longer probable.\n\nNEER capitalizes project development costs once it is probable that such costs will be realized through the ultimate construction of the related asset or sale of development rights. A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, NEER's capitalized development costs totaled approximately $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively , which are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. These costs include land rights and other third-party costs directly associated with the development of a new project. Upon commencement of construction, these costs either are transferred to construction work in progress or remain in other assets, depending upon the nature of the cost. Capitalized development costs are charged to O&amp;M  expenses when it is probable that these costs will not be realiz ed.\n\nNEER's  construction  work  in  progress  includes  construction  materials,  progress  payments  on  major  equipment  contracts,  third-party  engineering  costs, capitalized interest and other costs directly associated with the construction and development of various projects. Interest expense allocated from NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH) to NextEra Energy Resources is based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries. Upon commencement of project operation, costs associated with construction work in progress are transferred to electric plant in serv ice and other property.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations - NEE and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively , A ROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an A RO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. NEE's A ROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. See Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below and Note 11.\n\nFor NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the asset retirement cost is allocated to a regulatory liability or regulatory asset using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the A RO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the ARO and a decrease in the regulatory liability or regulatory asset. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the A RO and asset retirement cost, or regulatory liability when asset retirement cost is depleted.\n\nFor NEE's non-rate regulated operations, the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the A RO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original",

The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the study resulted in a decrease in Alabama Power's ARO liability of approximately $15 million. See \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" herein for additional information.\n\nFollowing initial criticality for Plant V ogtle Unit 3 and 4 on March 6, 2023 and February 14, 2024, respectively, G eorgia Power recorded AROs of approximately $90 million and $118 million, respectively. See \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" herein and Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\nIn September 2023 and November 2023, Georgia Power recorded net decreases of approximately $175 million and $210 million, respectively, to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule resulting from changes in estimates, including lower future inflation rates and the timing of closure activities.\n\nIn September 2024, Georgia Power completed updated decommissioning cost site studies for Plants Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 through 4. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the studies resulted in a decrease in Georgia Power's ARO liability of $389 million. See \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" herein for additional information.\n\nIn November 2024, Georgia Power recorded a net increase of approximately $60 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule resulting from changes in estimates, including higher future inflation rates and the timing of closure activities.\n\nThe cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information at December 31, 2024 using various assumptions related to closure and postclosure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. The cost estimates for Alabama Power are based on closure-in-place for all surface impoundments. The cost estimates for Georgia Power and Mississippi Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some surface impoundments and closure by removal for others. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note 3 under \"General Litigation Matters - Alabama Power\" for additional information.\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning\n\nThe NRC requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (Funds) to comply with the NRC's regulations. Use of the Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities. The Funds are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the IRS. While Alabama Power and Georgia Power are allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds' managers,",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) utilized trend analyses to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances and compared recorded balances to independently developed expectations, asserting that these assets are probable of recovery. NextEra Energy (NEE) specifically disclosed that it holds unrecognized amounts in regulatory assets related to net prepaid pension benefit costs, indicating deferred recognition of these items in financial statements. Southern Company (SO) provided a detailed table showing changes in the balance of regulatory assets tied to defined benefit pension plans across its operating entities for 2022 and 2023, reflecting active tracking and regulatory recognition of pension obligations over time. Together, these approaches show varying degrees of transparency and regulatory deferment strategies around pension liabilities across the three utility firms.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy reports audit fees at a highly granular level, breaking down fees by subsidiary and totaling $14.0 million for audit fees in 2023 across its various entities. NextEra Energy provides a more qualitative description of audit fees, focusing on governance and pre-approval processes without disclosing specific dollar amounts, indicating a more procedural approach to audit fee transparency. Southern Company, on the other hand, reports audit fees by business unit with specific figures such as $6,216,000 for Georgia Power in 2024, showing a structured but segmented view of audit costs.

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) includes wholesale sales to municipalities, public and private utilities, and power marketers as part of its total electricity sales, indicating that the wholesale segment plays a role in its broader sales mix, though specific revenue figures or percentages are not provided. NextEra Energy (NEE) actively competes in the wholesale full requirements business and frequently engages in short-term bilateral contracts to hedge price risk in the absence of long-term agreements, with 94% of its net generating capacity committed under long-term contracts as of December 31, 2023. Southern Company (SO), while not explicitly detailing its wholesale activities, implies a stake in this segment through its broader utility operations, which typically include wholesale participation as part of integrated system management. Together, these perspectives show that while all three operate in the wholesale electricity space, NEE takes a more structured and hedging-focused approach, DUK integrates it as part of a mixed sales strategy, and SO appears to engage more indirectly through system-level operations.",

          "chunk_text": "Obligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estim ated costs for site-specific plans. In April 2024, the E P A issued the 2024 C C R  R ule, which significantly expands the scope of the 2015 C C R  R ule by establishing regulatory requirem ents for inactive surface im poundm ents at retired generating facilities and previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities. AR O s recorded on the D uke E nergy R egistrants' C onsolidated Balance Sheets include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of these regulations and agreem ents.\n\nFor further inform ation, see N otes 4, 5 and 10 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"R egulatory M atters,\" \"C om m itm ents and C ontingencies\" and \"Asset R etirem ent O bligations.\"\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\nDuke E nergy calculated an estim ated im pairm ent on the disposition of its C om m ercial R enewables D isposal G roups as of D ecem ber 31, 2022. T he im pairm ent was recorded to writedown the carrying am ount to fair value, less cost to sell. T he fair value was prim arily determ ined from  the incom e approach using discounted cash flows, but also considered m arket inform ation obtained through the bidding process. E stim ated future cash flows under the incom e approach were based on D uke E nergy's forecast, which was inform ed by existing power purchase agreem ents with offtakers and forward m erchant curves. Significant assum ptions used in the incom e approach include forward m erchant curves and discount rates. T he discount rates considered both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. D uke E nergy m onitored the sales of the C om m ercial R enewables D isposal G roups and recorded adjustm ents to the im pairm ents as warranted by progression in the disposition process and changes in m arket inform ation.\n\nThe actual losses for the C om m ercial R enewables D isposal G roups could differ from  the estim ated losses recorded as of D ecem ber 31, 2024, as the disposition process is finalized, but any differences are not expected to be m aterial.\n\nFor further inform ation, see N ote 2 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"D ispositions.\"\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RE SOURCE S\n\n## Sources and Uses of Cash\n\nDuke E nergy relies prim arily upon cash flows from  operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirem ents. D uke Energy's capital requirem ents arise prim arily from  capital and investm ent expenditures, repaying long-term  debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Additionally, due to its existing tax attributes and projected tax credits to be generated relating to the IR A, D uke E nergy does not expect to be a significant federal cash taxpayer until around 2030. In 2024, D uke Energy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress began recording nuclear P T C  deferred tax assets related to the IR A and began m onetizing the P T C s in the transferability m arkets established by the IR A beginning in O ctober 2024. D uke E nergy C arolinas and D uke E nergy P rogress are working with the state utility com m issions on the appropriate regulatory process to pass the net realizable value back to custom ers over tim e. See N ote 24 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"Incom e T axes,\" for m ore inform ation.\n\nFrom  August through October 2024, a series of m ajor storm  events occurred that resulted in significant dam age to utility infrastructure within our service territories and prim arily im pacted D uke E nergy C arolinas', D uke E nergy P rogress' and D uke E nergy F lorida's electric utility operations. As discussed in N ote 4, to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"Regulatory M atters,\" hurricanes D ebby, H elene and M ilton caused widespread outages and included unprecedented dam age to certain assets, including the hardest-hit areas on the western coast of Florida and certain regions in western N orth C arolina and upstate South C arolina. F unding restoration activities and, in som e cases, the com plete rebuild of critical infrastructure, for a series of sequential events of this m agnitude has resulted in increm ental financing needs until cost recovery occurs. See \"M atters Im pacting F uture R esults\" for further details and N ote 7 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"D ebt and C redit F acilities,\" for inform ation regarding term  loans executed in response to these m ajor storm  events.\n\nSee Note 2 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"D ispositions,\" for the tim ing and use of proceeds from  the sale of certain C om m ercial R enewables assets to affiliates of Brookfield and ArcLight.\n\n## Capital E xpenditures\n\nDuke E nergy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors.

In addition, FPL accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. A s approved by the FPSC, FPL previously suspended its annual nuclear decommissioning accrual. A ny differences between expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount recovered through rates are reported as a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with regulatory accounting. See Rate Regulation, Electric Plant, Depreciation and A mortization, and A sset Retirement Obligations above and Note 11.\n\nNuclear decommissioning studies are performed at least every five years and are filed with the FPSC for approval. FPL filed updated nuclear decommissioning studies with the FPSC in December 2020. These studies reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL's nuclear units at the time of the studies. The 2020 studies provide for the dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 following the end of plant operation with decommissioning activities commencing in 2052 and 2053, respectively; however, in 2022, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) amended Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 license renewals by removing the 20 additional years of operation reflected in the studies. FPL filed a site-specific environmental impact statement with the NRC related to the previously approved 20-year renewal application for both Turkey Point operating licenses. A pproval of the additional 20 years occurred in September 2024. The studies filed in 2020 also provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2043. These studies also assume that FPL will be storing spent fuel on site pending removal to a United States (U.S.) government facility . FPL's portion of the ultimate costs of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including costs associated with spent fuel storage  above  what  is  expected  to  be  refunded  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  under  a  spent  fuel  settlement  agreement,  is  estimated  to  be approximately $9.6 billion, or $2.5 billion expressed in 2024 dollars. The ultimate costs of decommissioning reflect the applications submitted to the NRC for the extension of St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 licenses for an additional 20 years.\n\nRestricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPL's nuclear units are included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. M arketable securities held in the decommissioning funds are primarily carried at fair v alue. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses and estimated credit losses on debt securities, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding offset in the related regulatory asset or liability accounts. FPL does not currently make contributions to the decommissioning funds, other than the reinvestment of fund earnings. During 2024, 2023 and 2022 fund earnings on decommissioning funds were approximately $238 million, $144 million and $58 million, respectively. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\n\nOther generation plant dismantlement studies are performed periodically and are submitted to the FPSC for approval. A s part of the 2021 rate agreement, the FPSC approved an annual expense of $48 million based on FPL's dismantlement studies which became effective January 1, 2022. A t December 31, 2024, FPL's portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its other generation units is approximately $2.5 billion, or $1.2 billion expressed in 2024 dollars.\n\nNEER's AROs primarily include nuclear decommissioning liabilities for Seabrook Station (Seabrook), Duane A rnold Energy Center (Duane A rnold) and Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) and dismantlement liabilities for its wind and solar facilities. The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning or dismantlement activities are expected to be complete. See Note 11. A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, NEER's ARO was approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively , and was determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning or dismantlement. NEER's portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $9.8 billion, or $2.2 billion expressed in 2024 dollars. The ultimate cost to dismantle NEER's wind and solar facilities is estimated to be approximately $3.6 billion.\n\nSeabrook files a comprehensive nuclear decommissioning study with the New Hampshire Nuclear Decommissioning Financing Committee (NDFC) every four years; the most recent study was filed in 2023. Seabrook's decommissioning funding plan is also subject to annual review by the NDFC. Currently , there are no ongoing decommissioning funding requirements for Seabrook, Duane A rnold and Point Beach, however, the NRC, and in the case of Seabrook, the NDFC, has the authority to require additional funding in the future. NEER's portion of Seabrook's, Duane A rnold's and Point Beach's restricted funds for the payment of future expenditures  to  decommission  these  plants  is  included  in  nuclear  decommissioning  reserve  funds,  which  are  included  in  special  use  funds  on  NEE's consolidated balance sheets. M arketable securities held in the decommissioning funds are primarily carried at fair value. See Note 4. M arket adjustments for debt securities result in a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (OCI), except for estimated credit losses and unrealized losses on debt securities intended or",

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\nenvironm ental laws or regulations to m ore stringent com pliance levels could, and are likely to, result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or developm ent of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. T he costs to com ply with environm ental laws and regulations could have a m aterial effect on the D uke E nergy Registrants' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe E P A has issued or proposed federal regulations, including the new rules issued in April 2024, governing the m anagem ent of wastewater, C C R  m anagem ent units and C O emissions. N ew state legislation in response to such regulations could im pose carbon reduction goals that are m ore aggressive than the C om pany's plans. T hese regulations m ay require the D uke E nergy R egistrants to m ake additional capital expenditures and increase operating and m aintenance costs. 2\n\n## The Duke E nergy R egistrants' operations, capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes related to the impacts of global climate change.\n\nThere is continued concern, and increasing and conflicting activism , both nationally and internationally, about clim ate change. T he E P A and state regulators have, and m ay adopt and im plem ent, additional regulations to restrict em issions of G H G s to address global clim ate change, as well as reporting requirem ents regarding such em issions and related clim ate-goal claim s. C ertain local and state jurisdictions have also enacted laws to restrict or prevent new natural gas infrastructure. Increased regulation of G H G  em issions and reporting requirem ents could im pose significant additional costs on the D uke E nergy R egistrants' electric and natural gas operations, their suppliers and custom ers and affect dem and for energy conservation and renewable products, which could im pact both our electric and natural gas businesses. R egulatory changes and/or uncertainty of applicability of such legislative and regulatory initiatives could also result in generation facilities to be retired earlier than planned to m eet our net-zero 2050 goal. T hough we would plan to seek cost recovery for investm ents related to G H G  em issions reductions through regulatory rate structures, changes in the regulatory clim ate could result in the delay in or failure to fully recover such costs and investm ent in generation.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n## The Duke E nergy R egistrants' results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control.\n\nSustained downturns or sluggishness in the econom y generally affect the m arkets in which the D uke E nergy R egistrants operate and negatively influence operations. D eclines in demand for electricity or natural gas as a result of econom ic downturns in the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial custom ers reduce production and, therefore, consum ption of electricity and the use of natural gas. Although the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated electric and natural gas businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel and purchased natural gas costs, under periodic adjustm ent clauses, overall declines in electricity or natural gas sold as a result of econom ic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby dim inishing results of operations.\n\nA continuation of adverse econom ic conditions including econom ic downturn or high com m odity prices could also negatively im pact the financial stability of certain of our custom ers and result in their inability to pay for electric and natural gas services. T his could lead to increased bad debt expense and higher allowance for doubtful account reserves for the D uke Energy R egistrants and result in delayed or unrecovered operating costs and lower financial results. Additionally, prolonged econom ic downturns that negatively im pact the D uke Energy R egistrants' results of operations and cash flows could result in future m aterial im pairm ent charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants also m onitor the im pacts of inflation on the procurem ent of goods and services and seek to m inim ize its effects in future periods through pricing strategies, productivity im provem ents, and cost reductions. R apidly rising prices as a result of inflation, tariffs, or other factors m ay im pact the ability of the Company to recover costs tim ely or execute on its business strategy including the achievem ent of growth objectives.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants sell electricity into the spot m arket or other com petitive power m arkets on a contractual basis. W ith respect to such transactions, the D uke E nergy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investm ents through m andated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing m arket prices. T hese m arket prices m ay fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of tim e and could negatively im pact the C om pany's ability to accurately forecast the financial im pact or reduce the D uke E nergy R egistrants' revenues and m argins, thereby dim inishing results of operations.\n\nFactors that could im pact sales volum es, generation of electricity and m arket prices at which the D uke E nergy R egistrants are able to sell electricity and natural gas are as follows:\n\n- weather conditions, including extrem e winter or sum m er weather that could cause significantly lower or higher dem and for energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purposes, as applicable, storm -related custom er outages resulting in lower usage, or periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an econom ical m anner;\n- supply of and dem and for energy com m odities, including potential usage of electricity by data centers;\n- transm ission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;\n- availability of purchased power;\n- availability of com petitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by som e custom ers over electricity produced from  coal, nuclear or natural gas plants, and custom er usage of energy-efficient equipm ent that reduces energy dem and;\n- natural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices;\n- ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, including m aterials, supplies, and fuel such as coal, natural gas and uranium ; and\n- capacity and transm ission service into, or out of, the D uke E nergy R egistrants' m arkets.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nrequired to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are recognized in other - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. M arket adjustments for equity securities are recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses are recognized in income and are reinvested in the funds. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\n\nMajor M aintenance Costs - FPL expenses costs associated with planned maintenance for its non-nuclear electric generation plants as incurred. FPL recognizes costs associated with planned major nuclear maintenance in accordance with regulatory treatment. FPL defers nuclear maintenance costs for each nuclear unit's planned outage to a regulatory asset as the costs are incurred. FPL amortizes the costs to O&amp;M  expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\n\nNEER uses the deferral method to account for certain planned major maintenance costs. NEER's major maintenance costs for its nuclear generation units, combustion turbines and battery storage are capitalized (included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets) and amortized to O&amp;M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\n\nCash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of generally three months or less.\n\nRestricted Cash - A t  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  NEE  had  approximately  $159  million  ($101  million  for  FPL)  and  $730  million  ($15  million  for  FPL), respectively , of restricted cash, which, at December 31, 2024, was offset by $244 million of cash received on exchange-traded derivative positions resulting in a balance of $(85) million. Restricted cash accounts are included in current other assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and primarily relate to debt service payments and margin cash collateral requirements (funding) at NEER and bond proceeds held for construction at FPL. In addition, where offsetting positions exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral of $279 million is netted against derivative assets at December 31, 2024 and $194 million is netted against derivative assets and $815 million is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2023. See Note 3.\n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses - NEE, including FPL, follows the current expected credit loss model to account for credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes customer accounts receivable. FPL maintains an accumulated provision for uncollectible customer accounts receivable that is estimated using a percentage derived from historical revenue and write-off trends, adjusted for current events and forecasts. NEER regularly reviews collectibility  of its receiv ables and establishes a provision for losses estimated as a percentage of accounts receivable based on the historical bad debt write-off trends, adjusted for current events and forecasts. When necessary , NEER uses the specific identification method for all other receivables. NEE's credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates using established standards and credit quality indicators such as credit ratings, certain financial ratios and delinquency trends. NEE requires credit enhancements or secured payment terms from customers who do not meet the minimum criteria.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, NEE recorded approximately $52 million, $77 million and $113 million, respectively , of bad debt expense, including credit losses, which are included in O&amp;M  expenses in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n\nInventory - FPL values materials, supplies and fuel inventory using a weighted-average cost method. NEER's materials, supplies and fuel inventories, which include emissions allowances and renewable energy credits, are carried at the lower of weighted-average cost and net realizable value, unless evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost will be recovered with a normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of business.\n\nEnergy Trading - NEE provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load-following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to optimize the value of electricity and fuel contracts, generation facilities  and  natural  gas  and  oil  production  assets,  as  well  as  to  take  adv antage  of  projected  fav orable  commodity   price  mov ements.  Trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for at fair value and realized gains and losses from all trading contracts, including those where physical delivery is required, are recorded net for all periods presented. See Note 3.\n\nStorm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery - The storm funds provide coverage toward FPL's storm damage costs. M arketable securities held in the storm funds are carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding adjustment to the storm reserve. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes. The storm funds are included in special use funds and the storm reserves in noncurrent regulatory liabilities or, in the case of a deficit, in regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $36 million related to an impairment loss associated with Alabama Power discontinuing the development of a multi-use commercial facility, $21 million associated with an additional Rate NDR accrual, $16 million in certain employee compensation and benefits, $15 million in Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses, $10 million associated with reliability reserve accruals and reliability-related ex penses, $10 million in customer accounts primarily associated with bad debt ex pense, $9 million in transmission and distribution expenses primarily due to vegetation management, and $8 million related to the injuries and damages reserve. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $28 million in technology infrastructure and application production costs.\n\nSee Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\" and Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate CNP Compliance,\" \" - Rate NDR,\" and \" - Reliability Reserve Accounting Order\" for additional information.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $58 million, or 4.1%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to additional plant in service related to transmission and distribution facilities as well as Plant Barry Unit 8 being placed in service in November 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate CNP New Plant\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $29 million, or 6.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to increases of $13 million in property taxes primarily resulting from an increase in the assessed value of property and $13 million in utility license tax es resulting from an increase in the tax  base.\n\n## Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction\n\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction decreased $25 million, or 30.5%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to Plant Barry Unit 8 being placed in service in November 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate CNP New Plant\" for additional information.\n\n## Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized\n\nInterest ex pense, net of amounts capitalized increased $23 million, or 5.4%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily associated with increases of approximately $8 million related to higher interest rates and $8 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings, as well as a decrease of $8 million in AFUDC debt primarily due to Plant Barry Unit 8 being placed in service in November 2023. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Sources of Capital,\" Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate CNP New Plant,\" and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes increased $279 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to a decrease of $197 million in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes, as well as higher pre-tax  earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Excess Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Accounting Order\" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nGeorgia Power's 2024 net income was $2.5 billion, representing a $0.5 billion, or 22.3%, increase from the previous year. The increase was primarily due to higher retail revenues associated with the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates, base tariff increases in accordance with the 2022 ARP, and weather impacts, partially offset by a $112 million increase in charges to a valuation allowance on certain state tax  credit carryforwards.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) discloses that it shares in the construction costs of jointly owned generating and transmission facilities, paying its ownership share of such costs. This indicates a shared-risk model where participants finance their own portions. NextEra Energy (NEE) reveals that it is responsible for paying all construction costs related to a portfolio of wind and solar facilities under certain contingent repurchase agreements, highlighting a more centralized risk and financing approach. Southern Company (SO) notes that a portion of the construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is included in Georgia Power\u2019s rate base, suggesting a regulatory-backed financing mechanism that shifts some cost burden to ratepayers. Together, these disclosures reveal differing strategies: DUK uses joint ownership to distribute financial exposure, NEE absorbs construction costs internally under contingent arrangements, and SO leverages regulated rate base inclusion to finance major projects.",

          "chunk_text": "## 7. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS\n\nDuke Energy has various financial and performance guarantees and indemnifications with non-consolidated entities, which are issued in the normal course of business. As discussed below, these contracts include performance guarantees, standby letters of credit, debt guarantees and indemnifications. Duke Energy enters into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the transaction to the third party. At December 31, 2021, Duke Energy does not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under these guarantees. To the extent liabilities are incurred as a result of the activities covered by the guarantees, such liabilities are included on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nOn January 2, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its previously wholly owned natural gas businesses to shareholders. Guarantees issued by Duke Energy or its affiliates, or assigned to Duke Energy prior to the spin-off, remained with Duke Energy subsequent to the spin-off. Guarantees issued by Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Capital) or its affiliates prior to the spin-off remained with Spectra Capital subsequent to the spin-off, except for guarantees that were later assigned to Duke Energy. Duke Energy has indemnified Spectra Capital against any losses incurred under certain of the guarantee obligations that remain with Spectra Capital. At December 31, 2021, the maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees were $48 million, the majority of which expire by 2028.\n\nIn October 2017, ACP executed a $3.4 billion revolving credit facility with a stated maturity date of October 2021. Duke Energy entered into a guarantee agreement to support its share of the ACP revolving credit facility. In July 2020, ACP reduced the size of the credit facility to $1.9 billion. Duke Energy's maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee was $860 million as of December 31, 2020. This amount represented 47% of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and was recognized within Other Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020, of which $95 million was previously recognized due the adoption of new guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately $855 million to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee. See Notes 3 and 12 for more information.\n\nIn addition to the Spectra Capital and ACP revolving credit facility guarantees above, Duke Energy has issued performance guarantees to customers and other third parties that guarantee the payment and performance of other parties, including certain non-wholly owned entities, as well as guarantees of debt of certain non-consolidated entities. If such entities were to default on payments or performance, Duke Energy would be required under the guarantees to make payments on the obligations of these entities. The maximum potential amount of future payments required under these guarantees as of December 31, 2021, was $53 million of which all expire between 2022 and 2030, with the remaining performance guarantees having no contractual expiration. Additionally, certain guarantees have uncapped maximum potential payments; however, Duke Energy does not believe these guarantees will have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nDuke Energy uses bank-issued standby letters of credit to secure the performance of wholly owned and non-wholly owned entities to a third party or customer. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations to the issuing bank that are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the wholly owned or non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its underlying contract. At December 31, 2021, Duke Energy had issued a total of $586 million in letters of credit, which expire between 2022 and 2023. The unused amount under these letters of credit was $54 million.\n\nDuke Energy recognized $3 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively, primarily in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for the guarantees discussed above. As current estimates change, additional losses related to guarantees and indemnifications to third parties, which could be material, may be recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants in the future.\n\n## 8. JOINT OWNERSHIP OF GENERATING AND TRANSMISSION FACILITIES\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants maintain ownership interests in certain jointly owned generating and transmission facilities. The Duke Energy Registrants are entitled to a share of the generating capacity and output of each unit equal to their respective ownership interests. The Duke Energy Registrants pay their ownership share of additional construction costs, fuel inventory purchases and operating expenses. The Duke Energy Registrants share of revenues and operating costs of the jointly owned facilities is included within the corresponding line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Each participant in the jointly owned facilities must provide its own financing.\n\nThe following table presents the Duke Energy Registrants' interest of jointly owned plant or facilities and amounts included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All facilities are operated by the Duke Energy Registrants and are included in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment.\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests -  Certain  subsidiaries  of  NextEra  Energy  Resources  sold  Class  B  membership interests in entities that have ownership interests in wind generation as well as solar and solar plus battery storage facilities to third-party investors. As specified in the respective limited liability  company agreements, if, subject to certain contingencies, certain events occur, including, among others, those that would delay completion or cancel any of the underlying projects, an investor has the option to require NEER to return all or part of its investment. As these potential redemptions were outside of NEER's control, these balances were classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. These contingencies are expected to be resolved in 2022.\n\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs) - An entity is considered to be a VIE when its total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance  its  activities  without  additional  subordinated  financial  support,  or  its  equity  investors,  as  a  group,  lack  the  characteristics  of  having  a controlling financial interest. A reporting company is required to consolidate a VIE as its primary beneficiary when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. NEE and FPL evaluate whether an entity is a VIE whenever reconsideration events as defined by the accounting guidance occur. See Note 9.\n\nLeases -  NEE and FPL determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. NEE and FPL recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability for operating and finance leases by recognizing and measuring leases at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For sales-type leases, the book value of the leased asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type lease is recognized based on fixed payments under the contract and the residual value of the asset being leased. NEE and FPL have elected not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases and not to separate nonlease components from associated lease components for all classes of underlying assets except for purchased power agreements. ROU assets are included in noncurrent other assets, lease  liabilities  are  included  in  current  and  noncurrent  other  liabilities  and  net  investments  in  sales-type  leases  are  included  in  current  and noncurrent other assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease expense is included in fuel, purchased power and interchange  or  O&amp;M  expenses,  interest  and  amortization  expenses  associated  with  finance  leases  are  included  in  interest  expense  and depreciation and amortization expense, respectively, and rental income associated with operating leases and interest income associated with sales-type leases are included in operating revenues in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. See Note 10.\n\nDisposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests - In December 2021, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold their 100% ownership interest, comprised of a 50% controlling ownership interest to a NEP subsidiary and a 50% noncontrolling ownership interest  to  a  third  party,  in  a  portfolio  of  seven  wind  generation  facilities  and  six  solar  generation  facilities  in  geographically  diverse  locations throughout the U.S. representing a total generating capacity of 2,520 MW and 115 MW of battery storage capacity, three of which are currently under  construction  with  expected  in-service  dates  in  the  first  half  of  2022.  Total  cash  proceeds  for  these  two  separate  transactions  totaled approximately $1.7 billion, subject to working capital and other adjustments. NEER will continue to consolidate the three projects currently under construction  for  accounting  purposes.  A  NextEra  Energy  Resources  affiliate  will  continue  to  operate  the  facilities  included  in  the  sales.  In connection with the sales, a loss of approximately $53 million ($33 million after tax) is reflected in the gains on disposal of businesses/assets net in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with the three facilities currently under construction,  approximately  $668  million  of  cash  received  was  recorded  as  contract  liabilities,  which  is  included  in  current  other  liabilities  on NEE's consolidated balance sheet. The contract liabilities relate to sale proceeds from NEP and the third party of approximately $349 million and differential  membership  interests  of  approximately  $319  million,  of  which  $117  million  is  contingent  on  the  enactment  of  a  solar  PTC  by  a specified date in 2022. The contract liabilities associated with the sale proceeds and the differential membership interests are also subject to the three  facilities  under  construction  achieving  commercial  operations  by  specified  dates  in  the  first  half  of  2022.  The  contract  liabilities  will  be reversed and the sale recognized for accounting purposes if the contingencies are resolved in 2022. Otherwise, NextEra Energy Resources may be required to return proceeds related to differential membership interests and/or repurchase the facilities for up to $668 million. In addition, NextEra  Energy  Resources  is  responsible  to  pay  for  all  construction  costs  related  to  the  portfolio.  At  December  31,  2021,  approximately $970 million is included in accounts payable on NEE's consolidated balance sheet and represents amounts owed by NextEra Energy Resources to NEP to reimburse NEP for construction costs.\n\nIn October 2021, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale to a NEP subsidiary of their 100% ownership interests in three wind generation facilities and one solar generation facility located in the West and Midwest regions of the U.S. with a total generating capacity of 467 MW and 33.3% of the noncontrolling ownership interests in four solar generation facilities and multiple distributed generation solar facilities located  in  geographically  diverse  locations  throughout  the  U.S.  representing  a  total  net  ownership  interest  in  plant  capacity  (net  generating capacity)  of  122  MW  for  cash  proceeds  of  approximately  $563  million,  plus  working  capital  and  other  adjustments  of  $22  million. A  NextEra Energy  Resources  affiliate  will  continue  to  operate  the  facilities  included  in  the  sale.  In  connection  with  the  sale,  a  gain  of  approximately $94 million ($69 million after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets, and noncontrolling interests of approximately $125 million and additional paid-in capital of approximately $60 million ($43 million after tax) were recorded on NEE's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021.",

      "question": "How have Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Power (SO) each categorized or reported their operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses in 2024, and what do these differences in disclosure reveal about their cost structures and operational focus?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reported $1,388 million in operation, maintenance, and other expenses for 2024, indicating a relatively stable trend compared to prior years. NextEra Energy (NEE) explicitly defines O&M expenses in its glossary as 'other operations and maintenance expenses in the consolidated statements of income,' signaling a standardized reporting approach. Southern Power (SO) categorized $516 million under 'other operations and maintenance' for 2024, showing a year-over-year increase. These differences suggest that DUK maintains a consistent O&M cost base, NEE emphasizes clarity and standardization in its financial terminology, and SO has experienced rising maintenance costs, potentially reflecting asset age or operational intensity.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each manage their exposure to long-term contracts, and what does this reveal about their differing strategies in securing future revenue streams in the utilities sector?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) manages long-term contracts primarily through regulated, individually negotiated agreements for natural gas service, which include minimum margin contracts and supply arrangements with municipalities and power generation facilities, with revenues recognized monthly as service is provided. NextEra Energy (NEE) has long-term contracts for natural gas transportation expiring through 2042, and also has commitments for equipment procurement and nuclear fuel through 2033, with $4.4 billion of related commitments included in capital expenditure plans. Southern Company (SO) relies on long-term contracts with rural electric cooperatives and a municipality under cost-based tariffs regulated by FERC, which accounted for 14.0% of Mississippi Power\u2019s total operating revenues in 2023. Collectively, these strategies show that DUK focuses on regulated, steady-margin contracts, NEE emphasizes long-term infrastructure and equipment commitments, and SO leverages cost-based, FERC-regulated contracts with public entities to secure future revenue streams.",

      "question": "How have Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each been impacted by fluctuations in natural gas prices, and what do their respective disclosures reveal about the financial and operational risks associated with these price movements?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) discusses how increases in natural gas prices can negatively impact its competitive position in the residential and industrial customer markets, as higher gas costs may drive customers toward alternative energy sources like electricity or propane. This could reduce demand for natural gas and limit customer growth. NextEra Energy (NEE) notes that higher natural gas prices in 2022 are expected to increase its fuel cost recovery clause revenues and expenses, directly affecting its operating cash flows. Southern Company (SO) reveals that a significant decline in forecasted natural gas prices led to a full impairment of a $154 million pre-tax lease investment in 2020, highlighting the exposure of long-term lease and generation asset strategies to gas price volatility. Together, these perspectives illustrate how natural gas price fluctuations affect utility companies differently\u2014through competitive pressures, cost recovery mechanisms, and long-term asset impairments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Impact of Weather\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure revenues are generally protected from the impact of weather fluctuations due to the regulatory mechanisms that are available in most service territories. In North Carolina, margin decoupling provides protection from both weather and other usage variations like conservation for residential and small and medium general service customers. Margin decoupling provides a set margin per customer independent of actual usage. In South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, weather normalization adjusts revenues either up or down depending on how much warmer or colder than normal a given month has been. Weather normalization adjustments occur from November through March in South Carolina, from October through April in Tennessee and from November through April in Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio collects most of its non-fuel revenue through a fixed monthly charge that is not impacted by usage fluctuations that result from weather changes or conservation.\n\n## Competition\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure's businesses operate as the sole provider of natural gas service within their retail service territories. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure owns and operates facilities necessary to transport and distribute natural gas. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the underlying commodity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable natural gas service at fair prices.\n\nIn residential, commercial and industrial customer markets, natural gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy, primarily electric companies, propane and fuel oil dealers, renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants, as well as nuclear energy. A significant competitive factor is price. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic or market conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs.\n\nHigher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas, impair our ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass our systems in favor of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer growth and could cause customers to reduce or cease using our product, thereby reducing our ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow our business, adversely affecting our earnings.\n\n## Pipeline and Storage Investments\n\nDuke Energy, through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail. Sabal Trail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal Trail Natural Gas Pipeline (Sabal Trail pipeline) to transport natural gas to Florida, regulated by FERC. The Sabal Trail Phase I mainline was placed into service in July 2017 and traverses Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The remaining lateral line to the Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC was placed into service in March 2018. Phase II of Sabal Trail went into service in May 2020, adding approximately 200,000 Dth of capacity to the Sabal Trail pipeline.\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 47% equity ownership interest in ACP, which planned to build the ACP pipeline, an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline. The ACP pipeline was intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern markets and would be regulated by FERC. Dominion Energy owns 53% of ACP and was contracted to construct and operate the ACP pipeline upon completion. On July 5, 2020, Dominion announced a sale of substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, which were critical to the ACP pipeline. Further, permitting delays and legal challenges had materially affected the timing and cost of the pipeline. As a result, Duke Energy determined that they would no longer invest in the construction of the ACP pipeline.\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 24% equity ownership interest in Constitution, an interstate pipeline development company formed to develop, construct, own and operate a 124-mile natural gas pipeline and related facilities, regulated by FERC. Constitution was slated to transport natural gas supplies from the Marcellus supply region in northern Pennsylvania to major northeastern markets. As of February 5, 2020, the Constitution partners formally resolved to initiate the dissolution of Constitution, and to terminate the Constitution Pipeline project.\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 21.49% equity ownership interest in Cardinal, an intrastate pipeline located in North Carolina regulated by the NCUC, a 45% equity ownership in Pine Needle, an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in North Carolina and a 50% equity ownership interest in Hardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and Hampshire counties in West Virginia. Pine Needle and Hardy Storage are regulated by FERC.\n\nKO Transmission Company (KO Transmission), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, is an interstate pipeline company engaged in the business of transporting natural gas and is subject to the rules and regulations of FERC. KO Transmission's 90-mile pipeline supplies natural gas to Duke Energy Ohio and interconnects with the Columbia Gulf Transmission pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline. An approximately 70-mile portion of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities is co-owned by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation.\n\nSee Notes 3, 12 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\" and \"Variable Interest Entities,\" respectively, for further information on Duke Energy's pipeline investments.\n\n## Inventory\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure must maintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2021, the inventory balance for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure was $125 million. For more information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"",

In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order approving  the  2016  rate  agreement  which  became  effective  in  January  2017  and  remained  in  effect  until  December  2021.  The  2016  rate agreement established the FPL segment's allowed regulatory ROE at 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60%, and allowed for retail rate base increases in 2017, 2018, and upon commencement of commercial operations at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and certain solar projects. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021 for additional information on the 2016 rate agreement.\n\nRetail base revenues decreased $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and were impacted by a decrease of 2.6% in the average usage per retail customer, primarily related to unfavorable weather when compared to the prior year, partly offset by an increase of 1.5% in the average number of customer accounts. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation.\n\n## Cost Recovery Clauses\n\nRevenues  from  fuel  and  other  cost  recovery  clauses  and  pass-through  costs,  such  as  franchise  fees,  revenue  taxes  and  storm-related surcharges, are largely a pass-through of costs. Such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery  clauses  on  certain  assets,  primarily  related  to  certain  solar,  environmental  projects,  storm  protection  plan  investments  and  the unamortized balance of the regulatory asset associated with the FPL segment's acquisition of certain generation facilities. See Item 1. Business FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Cost Recovery Clauses. Underrecovery or overrecovery of cost recovery clause and other pass-through costs (deferred clause and franchise expenses and revenues) can significantly affect NEE's and FPL's operating cash flows. The 2021 net underrecovery impacting the FPL segment's operating cash flows was approximately $516 million, primarily related to the fuel cost recovery clause.\n\nFuel cost recovery revenues increased approximately $775 million in 2021 primarily as a result of higher fuel and energy prices. In 2021 and 2020, cost recovery clauses contributed approximately $124 million and $111 million, respectively, to the FPL segment's net income. FPL's fuel cost recovery clause revenues and expenses are expected to increase in 2022 as a result of the collection of underrecovered 2021 fuel costs and higher projected natural gas prices in 2022.\n\n## Other Items Impacting the FPL Segment's Consolidated Statements of Income\n\nFuel, Purchase Power and Interchange Expense\n\nFuel, purchased power and interchange expense increased $807 million in 2021 primarily related to higher fuel and energy prices.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization Expense\n\nThe major components of the FPL segment's depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\nSince 2017, the financial and operational performance of the remaining domestic lessee and the associated generation assets raised significant concerns about the short-term ability of the generation assets to produce cash flows sufficient to support ongoing operations and the lessee's contractual obligations and its ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments through the end of the lease term in 2047. In addition, following the expiration of the existing power offtake agreement in 2032, the lessee also is exposed to remarketing risk, which encompasses the price and availability of alternative sources of generation.\n\nIn connection with the 2019 annual impairment analysis, Southern Company revised the estimated cash flows to be received under the leveraged lease, which resulted in an impairment charge of $17 million ($13 million after tax) recorded in the fourth quarter 2019. During the second quarter 2020, Southern Company received the latest annual forecasts of natural gas prices and considered the significant decline in forecasted prices to be an indicator of potential impairment that required an interim impairment assessment. Accordingly, consistent with prior impairment analyses, Southern Company evaluated the recoverability of the lease receivable and the expected residual value of the generation assets under various natural gas price scenarios to estimate the cash flows expected to be received from remarketing the generation assets following the expiration of the existing PPA and the residual value of the generation assets at the end of the lease. Based on the forecasts of energy prices in the years following the expiration of the existing PPA, Southern Company concluded that it was no longer probable that any of the associated rental payments would be received, because it was no longer probable the generation assets would be successfully remarketed and continue to operate after that date. During the second quarter 2020, Southern Company revised the estimated cash flows to be received under the leveraged lease to reflect this conclusion, which resulted in a full impairment of the lease investment and a pre-tax charge to earnings of $154 million ($74 million after tax).\n\nAll required lease payments through December 31, 2021 have been paid in full. If any future lease payments due prior to the expiration of the associated PPA are not paid in full, the Southern Holdings subsidiary may be unable to make its corresponding payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the generation assets. Failure to make the required payment to the debtholders could represent an event of default that would give the debtholders the right to foreclose on, and take ownership",

      "answer": "The decline in fuel prices in 2024 had distinct impacts on Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO). DUK experienced a $121 million increase in fuel and purchased power expenses due to higher recovery of fuel costs in some regions, but this was partially offset by lower fuel prices and volumes in others. NEE saw a $573 million decrease in fuel, purchased power, and interchange expense, largely attributed to lower fuel and energy prices, which also contributed to a net over-recovery in cost recovery clauses. SO noted that while fuel price fluctuations affect wholesale revenues, they are accompanied by corresponding changes in fuel costs, leaving net income largely unaffected. These responses reflect differences in regulatory structures and cost recovery mechanisms across the companies, with DUK and NEE benefiting from lower fuel prices through expense moderation, while SO's integrated system absorbs the volatility without significant net income impact.",

P rior approval from  the relevant state utility com m ission is required for G U &amp;I to issue securities. T he underlying concept of utility ratem aking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\n\nI n addition to am ounts collected from  custom ers through approved base rates, each of the state utility com m issions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective com m ission determ ines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent.\n\nNatural gas costs are eligible for recovery by G U &amp;I. D ue to the associated regulatory treatm ent and the m ethod allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from  year to year have no m aterial im pact on operating results of G U &amp;I, unless a com m ission finds a portion of such costs to have been im prudent. H owever, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from  custom ers can adversely im pact the tim ing of cash flows of G U &amp;I. G U &amp;I also has various regulatory m echanism s in place to track and recover certain costs associated with capital investm ents including the IM R  in N orth C arolina, AR M  in T ennessee, and C E P  R ider in O hio.",

Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of NEE and FPL, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, installation of distributed generation technologies and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation, expanded use of data centers, inflation and the overall level of economic activity . A  lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in  customer  demand  for  electricity  or  natural  gas  and  other  fuels  may  cause  NEE  and  FPL  to  fail  to  fully   realiz e  the  anticipated  benefits  from  significant investments and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions and related impacts, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather.\n\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, droughts, extreme temperatures, icing events, wildfires, severe convective storms and earthquakes, can be destructive and cause power outages, personal injury and property damage, reduce revenue, affect the availability of fuel and water, and require NEE and FPL to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power, to access available financing sources, to obtain insurance, to pay for any associated injuries and damages and to fund any associated legal matters and compliance penalties. Furthermore, NEE's and FPL's physical plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, particularly relevant to FPL, a change in sea level. FPL operates in the east and lower west coasts of Florida and in northwest Florida, areas that historically have been prone to severe weather events, such as hurricanes. A  disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent NEE and FPL from operating their business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. A dditionally , the actions taken to address the potential for severe weather such as additional winterizing of critical equipment and infrastructure, modifying or alternating plant operations and expanding load shedding options could result in significant increases in costs. A ny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nAt FPL and other businesses of NEE where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service, to repair damaged facilities or for other actions to address severe weather is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nChanges in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, NEER's wind and solar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, NEER's results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically , and NEE's results of operations generally , may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. T o the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected.\n\nThreats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from geopolitical factors, terrorism, cyberattacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt NEE 's and F PL's business, or the businesses of third parties, may materially adversely affect NE E 's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE and FPL are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of geopolitical factors, terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyberattacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. There have been cyberattacks and other physical attacks within the energy industry on energy infrastructure such as substations, gas pipelines and related assets in the past and there may be such attacks in the future.  In addition, the advancement of artificial intelligence has given rise to added vulnerabilities and potential entry points for cyberattacks. NEE's and FPL's generation, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems could be direct targets of, or otherwise be materially adversely affected by, such activities.\n\nGeopolitical factors, terrorist acts, cy berattacks or other similar ev ents affecting NEE's and FPL's systems and facilities, or those of third parties on which NEE and FPL rely , could harm NEE's and FPL's businesses by , for example, limiting their ability to generate, purchase, store or transmit power, natural gas or other energy-related commodities, limiting their ability to bill customers and collect and process payments, and delaying their development and construction of new generation, distribution, storage or transmission facilities or capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result  in  a  material  decrease  in  rev enues,  significant  additional  costs  (for  ex ample,  to  repair  assets,  implement  additional  security   requirements  or maintain or acquire insurance), significant fines and penalties, and reputational damage, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's operations (for example, by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels), and could impair NEE's and FPL's ability to raise capital (for example, by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity).

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## All Other\n\nAll other includes a renewable natural gas business, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements. All other included a natural gas storage facility in California through its sale in September 2023. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL\n\n## General\n\nPrices for electric service provided by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution service provided by the natural gas distribution utilities to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed through various regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities for the foreseeable future. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Utility Regulation\" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.\n\nEach Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The level of the Registrants' future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein. The Registrants are unable to predict changes in law, regulations, regulatory guidance, legal interpretations, policy positions, and implementation actions that may result from the change in presidential administrations.\n\nFor the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel, restoration following major storms, and capital ex penditures, including constructing new electric generating plants, extending the retirement dates of certain fossil fuel plants, and ex panding and improving the transmission and distribution systems; continued customer growth; and the trends of an uncertain inflationary environment and reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets.\n\nEarnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales and pricing of large customers such that incremental costs are met with adequate incremental revenues, considering, among other things, recent trends driving projected growth in electricity consumption including the increasing digitization of the economy and growth in data centers, an increase in industrial activity in the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and continued electrification of transportation. These projected growth opportunities could be offset by energy efficiency trends in each market.\n\nGlobal and U.S. economic conditions continue to be affected by higher-than-expected inflation that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated policy responses of governments and central banks. In response to elevated inflation levels, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates faster than any rate increase cycle in the last 40 years, which have helped to slow the rate of inflation and curtail economic activity. In 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve began cutting policy rates as inflation began to approach the 2% target level. Uncertainty remains as to whether the rate reductions will continue in 2025 as potential fiscal policy changes could influence inflation levels, progress to the 2% target, and subsequent policy rate decisions. This uncertainty in economic growth, interest rates, tariffs, and inflation could impact customer demand for energy and the cost of doing business. The shifting economic policy variables and weakening of historic relationships among economic activity, prices, and employment have increased the uncertainty of future levels of economic activity, which will directly impact future energy demand and operating costs. Weakening economic activity increases the risk of slowing or declining energy sales. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on energy sales in the Southern Company system's service territory during 2024.\n\nThe level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to ex ecute its growth strategy through the development, construction, or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while containing costs; regulatory matters; customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards; continued availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs, which could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission constraints; cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool; and operational limitations.

      "question": "How do Duke Energy, NextEra Energy, and Southern Company each prioritize long-term debt issuance in 2021 as part of their broader capital allocation strategies, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to funding infrastructure investments versus shareholder returns?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy issued $3.758 billion in net long-term debt in 2021, reflecting a significant increase compared to $1.824 billion in 2020, which suggests a strategic shift toward debt financing to support capital expenditures and potentially ease pressure on operating cash flows. NextEra Energy issued $16.683 billion in long-term debt in 2021, far exceeding retirements of $9.594 billion, indicating a strong emphasis on leveraging debt markets to fund growth initiatives, particularly in renewables and grid modernization. Southern Company, while not disclosing exact figures, highlighted that its financing activities were primarily driven by net issuances of long-term debt to support construction programs and infrastructure investments, such as Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, while also balancing common stock dividend payments. Together, these patterns reveal that Duke and Southern are using long-term debt to sustain capital-heavy projects, whereas NextEra is aggressively expanding its asset base through substantial debt issuance.",

The net cash used for financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments and net repayments of short-term bank debt and commercial paper, partially offset by net issuances of long-term debt and issuances of common stock.\n\n## Alabama Power\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities increased $311 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in retail revenues associated with a Rate RSE adjustment effective in January 2021 and higher customer usage, as well as the timing of fossil fuel stock purchases and receivable collections, partially offset by decreased fuel cost recovery.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to gross property additions.\n\nThe net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to capital contributions from Southern Company and net long-term debt issuances, partially offset by common stock dividend payments.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities decreased $37 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to decreased fuel cost recovery, partially offset by the timing of customer receivable collections and vendor payments and customer bill credits issued in 2020 associated with Tax Reform and 2018 and 2019 earnings in excess of the allowed retail ROE range.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to gross property additions, including approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, related to the construction of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4.

      "answer": "Duke Energy reported $26 million in AROs as of December 31, 2023, showing a slight decrease from $27 million in 2022, indicating relatively stable long-term liability exposure. NextEra Energy disclosed total AROs of $2,170 million in 2023, with a breakdown showing decommissioning obligations at $1,882 million and dismantlement at $283 million, suggesting significant ongoing nuclear-related liabilities. Southern Company recorded dynamic changes in AROs, including a $90 million increase for Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and net decreases totaling $1,175 million across other nuclear and CCR-related obligations, reflecting both new commitments and revised estimates. Together, these figures highlight varying degrees of exposure and evolving liability management strategies across the three utilities.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy highlights that a downgrade below investment grade could trigger collateral posting requirements, increase borrowing costs, and reduce access to capital markets, with potential material effects on liquidity and profitability. NextEra Energy reports that approximately 88% of its $2.6 billion credit risk exposure in energy marketing and trading is with investment-grade counterparties, indicating a reliance on the stability of those ratings to manage counterparty risk. Southern Company discloses that certain subsidiaries could face up to $72 million in collateral requirements if credit ratings fall below BBB-/Baa3, and that it actively monitors and requires collateral from counterparties based on investment-grade ratings. Synthesizing these perspectives, Duke Energy faces the most direct operational and liquidity risk from a downgrade, NextEra Energy is exposed through counterparty relationships but maintains a relatively strong credit filter, and Southern Company has defined contingent collateral exposure but appears to have more structured risk mitigation in place.",

          "chunk_text": "## LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL R E QU IR E ME N TS AN D  CO MMON  STOCK  R ISK S\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term debt and equity markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of which are beyond the D uke E nergy Registrants' control.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' businesses are significantly financed through issuances of debt and equity. T he m aturity and repaym ent profile of debt used to finance investm ents often does not correlate to cash flows from  their assets. Accordingly, as a source of liquidity for capital requirem ents not satisfied by the cash flows from  their operations and to fund investm ents originally financed through debt instrum ents with disparate m aturities, the D uke E nergy R egistrants rely on access to short-term  m oney m arkets as well as longerterm  capital m arkets. T he Subsidiary R egistrants also rely on access to short-term  intercom pany borrowings. Access to capital m arkets m ay also be critical to finance unexpected material expenditures such as unusually volatile com m odity costs or significant storm  restoration activities for severe weather events. If the D uke E nergy R egistrants are not able to access debt or equity at com petitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their operations and im plem ent their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access debt and equity m ay lim it the D uke E nergy R egistrants' ability to pursue im provem ents or acquisitions that they m ay otherwise rely on for future growth.\n\nMarket disruptions m ay increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or m ore financial m arkets. Such disruptions could include: econom ic downturns, unfavorable capital m arket conditions, m arket prices for natural gas and coal, geopolitical risks, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, or the overall health of the energy industry. Additionally, rapidly rising interest rates could im pact the ability to affordably finance the capital plan or increase rates to custom ers and could have an im pact on our ability to execute on our energy transition. T he availability of credit under D uke E nergy's M aster C redit F acility depends upon the ability of the banks providing com m itm ents under the facility to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. System ic risk of the banking system  and the financial m arkets could prevent a bank from  m eeting its obligations under the facility agreem ent.\n\nDuke E nergy m aintains a revolving credit facility to provide backup for its com m ercial paper program  and letters of credit to support variable rate dem and tax-exem pt bonds that m ay be put to the D uke E nergy R egistrant issuer at the option of the holder. T he facility includes borrowing sublim its for the D uke E nergy R egistrants, each of whom  is a party to the credit facility, and financial covenants that lim it the am ount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity. F ailure to m aintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude D uke E nergy from  issuing com m ercial paper or the D uke E nergy R egistrants from  issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the M aster C redit F acility.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. If the D uke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may materially adversely affect their liquidity.\n\nEach of the D uke E nergy R egistrants' senior long-term  debt issuances is currently rated investm ent grade by various rating agencies. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants cannot ensure their senior long-term  debt will be rated investm ent grade in the future.\n\nI f the rating agencies were to rate the D uke E nergy R egistrants below investm ent grade, borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, if the short-term  debt rating were to fall, access to the com m ercial paper m arket could be significantly lim ited.\n\nA downgrade below investm ent grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form  of letters of credit or cash under various credit, com m odity and capacity agreem ents and trigger term ination clauses in som e interest rate derivative agreem ents, which would require cash paym ents. All of these events would likely reduce the D uke E nergy Registrants' liquidity and profitability and could have a m aterial effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nNon-compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the D uke E nergy R egistrants' ability to execute future borrowings.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' debt and credit agreem ents contain various financial and other covenants. F ailure to m eet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or term ination of the agreem ents.\n\nMarket performance and other changes may decrease the value of the N D TF investments of D uke E nergy Carolinas, D uke E nergy Progress and D uke E nergy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding.\n\nOwnership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the m aintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decom m issioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The perform ance of the capital m arkets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. D uke E nergy C arolinas, D uke E nergy Progress and D uke E nergy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. T hese assets are subject to m arket fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which m ay fall below projected rates of return. Although a num ber of factors im pact funding requirem ents, a decline in the m arket value of the assets m ay increase the funding requirem ents of the obligations for decom m issioning nuclear plants. If D uke E nergy C arolinas, D uke E nergy P rogress and D uke E nergy F lorida are unable to successfully manage their N D T F  assets or if the cost of decom m issioning nuclear generation facilities exceeds the am ount available in decom m issioning funds and such costs cannot be recovered through insurance or regulatory m echanism s, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected.",

NEE's  credit  department  monitors  current  and  forward  credit  exposure  to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. For all derivative and contractual transactions, NEE's energy marketing and trading operations, which include FPL's energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Some relevant considerations when assessing NEE's energy marketing and trading operations' credit risk exposure include the following:\n\n- Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry.\n- Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy , utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the U.S.\n- Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the EM C.\n- Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral.\n- Master netting agreements are used to offset cash and noncash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty . NEE's policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties.\n\nBased on NEE's policies and risk exposures related to credit, NEE and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's credit risk exposure associated with its energy marketing and trading operations, taking into account collateral and contractual netting rights, totaled approximately $2.6 billion ($64 million for FPL), of which approximately 88% (99% for FPL) was with companies that have investment grade credit ratings.

There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $72 million at December 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $24 million at December 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the creditrisk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions, and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain ex changes to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $17 million.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's, S&amp;P, or Fitch or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit ex posure. The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their ex posure to counterparty credit risk.\n\nSouthern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investmentgrade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each characterize their cash paid for income taxes, net, in 2024, and what does this reveal about their respective tax strategies and financial positioning in the utilities sector?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reported cash paid for income taxes, net, of $315 million in 2024, which reflects a significant increase from $310 million in 2023 and a much higher level compared to $79 million in 2022. This suggests a growing tax burden or fewer tax credits available for utilization. NextEra Energy (NEE) paid $640 million in income taxes, net, in 2024, a decrease from $981 million in 2023, indicating either a strategic tax planning shift or a reduction in taxable income. Southern Company (SO), in contrast, reported a negative $14 million for cash paid for income taxes, net, in 2024, meaning it received more in tax credits or refunds than it paid, highlighting a potentially aggressive tax credit utilization strategy. Together, these figures reveal differing tax strategies\u2014DUK appears to be experiencing rising tax obligations, NEE shows a reduction in net tax payments, and SO benefits from net tax credits, which may reflect differences in capital investment, regulatory environments, or renewable energy credit utilization.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reports $180 million in Construction Work in Progress for Transmission and local facilities under Duke Energy Indiana, indicating a focus on grid modernization and localized infrastructure. NextEra Energy (NEE) shows $149 million in Construction Work in Progress for St. Lucie Unit No. 2 and $73 million for Seabrook, highlighting investments in nuclear and transmission assets. Southern Company (SO) discloses that $193 million in acquisitions during 2023 were recorded within Construction Work in Progress, with plans to expand capacity by up to 205 MWs in a second phase expected to be operational by Q2 2026, emphasizing renewable energy expansion through acquisitions and phased development. Collectively, these allocations reflect distinct strategic focuses: DUK on transmission upgrades, NEE on nuclear and regional infrastructure, and SO on renewable energy growth through acquisition-led development.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each report their equity earnings from investments, and what do their disclosures reveal about the relative contribution and volatility of these earnings to their overall financial performance?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy reported equity in (losses) earnings of $ (9) million in 2024, showing a decline from $113 million in 2023, indicating a volatile contribution from its investments. NextEra Energy reported equity in earnings of equity method investees at $203 million in 2022, with a significant investment base of $6,582 million in equity method investees, suggesting a more substantial and potentially stable investment portfolio. Southern Company consistently reported earnings from equity method investments of $146 million in 2024, showing a more stable and moderate contribution from its investments compared to DUK and NEE. When combined, these disclosures show that while all three utilities engage in equity investments, the scale, consistency, and impact of these investments on overall financial performance vary significantly, with NEE showing the largest and most consistent equity earnings, SO showing moderate stability, and DUK showing recent declines and volatility.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) primarily engages in long-term wholesale contracts for electric service, which are cost-based and regulated by FERC, with revenue recognition tied to incurred costs and peak demand, and these contracts often span multiple years. NextEra Energy (NEE) has significant long-term commitments, including natural gas transportation contracts with expiration dates through 2042 and contracts for wind turbines, solar modules, and nuclear fuel extending through 2033, with over $4.3 billion in commitments tied to capital expenditures. Southern Company (SO) emphasizes the strategic importance of securing new long- and short-term contracts with wholesale customers, highlighting it as a key risk factor and business objective. Together, these disclosures illustrate that while all three companies rely on long-term contracts, DUK focuses on regulated cost recovery, NEE emphasizes infrastructure and renewable procurement commitments, and SO underscores contract acquisition as a strategic imperative.",

          "chunk_text": "Cash flows from sales of receivables are reflected within Cash Flows From Operating Activities and Cash Flows from Investing Activities on Duke Energy Ohio's and Duke Energy Indiana's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nCollection fees received in connection with servicing transferred accounts receivable are included in Operation, maintenance and other on Duke Energy Ohio's and Duke Energy Indiana's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The loss recognized on sales of receivables is calculated monthly by multiplying receivables sold during the month by the required discount. The required discount is derived monthly utilizing a three-year weighted average formula that considers charge-off history, late charge history and turnover history on the sold receivables, as well as a component for the time value of money. The discount rate, or component for the time value of money, is the prior month-end LIBOR plus a fixed rate of 1%.\n\n## 18. REVENUE\n\nDuke Energy recognizes revenue consistent with amounts billed under tariff offerings or at contractually agreed upon rates based on actual physical delivery of electric or natural gas service, including estimated volumes delivered when billings have not yet occurred. As such, the majority of Duke Energy's revenues have fixed pricing based on the contractual terms of the published tariffs, with variability in expected cash flows attributable to the customer's volumetric demand and ultimate quantities of energy or natural gas supplied and used during the billing period. The stand-alone selling price of related sales are designed to support recovery of prudently incurred costs and an appropriate return on invested assets and are primarily governed by published tariff rates or contractual agreements approved by relevant regulatory bodies. As described in Note 1, certain excise taxes and franchise fees levied by state or local governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a gross basis as part of revenues. Duke Energy elects to account for all other taxes net of revenues.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time as energy or natural gas is delivered and consumed with billings generally occurring monthly and related payments due within 30 days, depending on regulatory requirements. In no event does the timing between payment and delivery of the goods and services exceed one year. Using this output method for revenue recognition provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of electric and natural gas service as customers obtain control of the commodity and benefit from its use at delivery. Additionally, Duke Energy has an enforceable right to consideration for energy or natural gas delivered at any discrete point in time and will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which Duke Energy is entitled for the energy or natural gas delivered.\n\nAs described above, the majority of Duke Energy's tariff revenues are at-will and, as such, related contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less and will not have future performance obligations for disclosure. Additionally, other long-term revenue streams, including wholesale contracts, generally provide services that are part of a single performance obligation, the delivery of electricity or natural gas. As such, other than material fixed consideration under long-term contracts, related disclosures for future performance obligations are also not applicable.\n\nDuke Energy earns substantially all of its revenues through its reportable segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables.\n\n## Electric Utilities and Infrastructure\n\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure earns the majority of its revenues through retail and wholesale electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. Duke Energy generally provides retail and wholesale electric service customers with their full electric load requirements or with supplemental load requirements when the customer has other sources of electricity.\n\nRetail electric service is generally marketed throughout Duke Energy's electric service territory through standard service offers. The standard service offers are through tariffs determined by regulators in Duke Energy's regulated service territory. Each tariff, which is assigned to customers based on customer class, has multiple components such as an energy charge, a demand charge, a basic facilities charge and applicable riders. Duke Energy considers each of these components to be aggregated into a single performance obligation for providing electric service, or in the case of distribution only customers in Duke Energy Ohio, for delivering electricity. Electricity is considered a single performance obligation satisfied over time consistent with the series guidance and is provided and consumed over the billing period, generally one month. Retail electric service is typically provided to at-will customers who can cancel service at any time, without a substantive penalty. Additionally, Duke Energy adheres to applicable regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction to ensure the collectability of amounts billed and appropriate mitigating procedures are followed when necessary. As such, revenue from contracts with customers for such contracts is equivalent to the electricity supplied and billed in that period (including unbilled estimates).\n\nWholesale electric service is generally provided under long-term contracts using cost-based pricing. FERC regulates costs that may be recovered from customers and the amount of return companies are permitted to earn. Wholesale contracts include both energy and demand charges. For full requirements contracts, Duke Energy considers both charges as a single performance obligation for providing integrated electric service. For contracts where energy and demand charges are considered separate performance obligations, energy and demand are each a distinct performance obligation under the series guidance and are satisfied as energy is delivered and stand-ready service is provided on a monthly basis. This service represents consumption over the billing period and revenue is recognized consistent with billings and unbilled estimates, which generally occur monthly. Contractual amounts owed are typically trued up annually based upon incurred costs in accordance with FERC published filings and the specific customer's actual peak demand. Estimates of variable consideration related to potential additional billings or refunds owed are updated quarterly.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy, NextEra Energy, and Southern Company differ in their cash paid for income taxes in 2023, and what does this suggest about their respective tax planning and operational strategies within the utility sector?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy reported paying $90 million in cash for income taxes in 2023, indicating a relatively straightforward tax liability position. Southern Company disclosed $52 million in cash paid for income taxes, suggesting a more modest tax burden, potentially reflecting differences in jurisdictional tax rates or deductions. In contrast, NextEra Energy did not explicitly disclose a specific cash paid for income taxes figure; however, its financial statements highlight complex tax dynamics stemming from renewable energy investments, including valuation allowances, unrecognized tax benefits, and differential membership interests. These differences suggest that Duke Energy and Southern Company may operate under more conventional utility tax structures, while NextEra Energy leverages tax incentives tied to clean energy to reduce its effective tax position. This distinction in cash tax outflows likely affects each company's liquidity, with NextEra potentially reinvesting greater cash flows into renewable infrastructure, whereas Duke and Southern may have more predictable but less tax-advantaged capital deployment profiles.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each treat the equity component of allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC-Equity) in their financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their capital investment strategies and regulatory environments?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy reports AFUDC equity as a significant line item in its consolidated financial data, with a value of $154 million in 2020, indicating active capital investment in construction projects during that year. NextEra Energy defines AFUDC equity in its glossary, signaling its importance in explaining financing during construction, particularly in regulated utility segments like Florida Power & Light. Southern Company reports AFUDC-Equity as a reconciling item in its effective tax rate calculations, showing a negative adjustment of (0.4)% in 2019, suggesting a smaller or more tax-optimized use of AFUDC equity. Together, these differences suggest varying levels of reliance on AFUDC equity as part of their capital financing strategies, with Duke and NextEra placing more emphasis on it in their disclosures than Southern Company.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 AFUDC Equity: DUK reports AFUDC equity as $154 million in 2020, indicating a material impact from construction-related financing in its consolidated operations.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) saw increases in operating revenues driven by higher pricing from North Carolina and South Carolina rate cases, weather-normal retail sales volume, and transmission revenues. However, these gains were partially offset by decreases in fuel and capacity revenues (-$223M) and storm revenues (-$190M). NextEra Energy (NEE) experienced a decline in operating revenues due to a $1,090M drop in storm cost recovery revenues and a $526M decrease in fuel cost recovery revenues, despite lower fuel prices reducing expenses. Southern Company (SO) reported an increase in operating revenues from $19,998M in 2023 to $21,603M in 2024 across its Electric Operating Companies, with Southern Power contributing $2,014M and total consolidated revenues reaching $26,724M. The companies each experienced different revenue dynamics: DUK benefited from rate adjustments and weather-related demand, NEE faced a significant drop in cost recovery revenues post-storm, and SO saw steady growth across its utility and power segments.",

        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Operating Revenues: DUK's operating revenues increased due to rate cases in NC and SC, weather-normal retail sales, and transmission revenues, but were offset by lower fuel and storm-related revenues (e.g., -$223M in fuel and capacity, -$190M in storm revenues).",
        "Hop 2: NEE \u2192 Operating Revenues: NEE's operating revenues declined due to a $1,090M drop in storm cost recovery revenues and a $526M decrease in fuel cost recovery, despite lower fuel prices reducing expenses.",

Such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery clauses on certain assets, primarily related to certain solar, environmental projects, storm protection plan investments and the unamortized balance of the regulatory asset associated with FPL's acquisition of certain generation facilities. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Cost Recovery Clauses. Underrecovery or over-recovery of cost recovery clause and other pass-through costs (deferred clause and franchise expenses and revenues) can significantly affect NEE's and FPL's operating cash flows. The change from a net under-recovery of cost recovery clauses at December 31, 2023 to a net over-recovery of cost recovery clauses at December 31, 2024 impacting FPL's operating cash flows was approximately $1,016 million, primarily related to lower fuel prices.\n\nThe decrease in operating revenues in 2024 reflects lower storm cost recovery revenues of approximately $1,090 million primarily associated with the completion of surcharges for Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as discussed above. The decrease in operating revenues in 2024 was also impacted by a decrease in fuel cost recovery revenues of approximately $526 million primarily as a result of lower fuel and energy prices. In 2024 and 2023, cost recovery clauses contributed approximately $417 million and $369 million, respectively, to FPL's net income.\n\n## Other Items Impacting FPL's Consolidated Statements of Income\n\n## Fuel, Purchase Power and Interchange Expense\n\nFuel, purchased power and interchange expense decreased $573 million in 2024 primarily related to lower fuel and energy prices.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization Expense\n\nThe major components of FPL's depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) differ in their approaches to estimating and managing their Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in their 2023 filings?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) highlights that adverse economic conditions, including recessions or high commodity prices, could increase bad debt expense and higher allowance for doubtful account reserves due to customers' inability to pay for services. NextEra Energy (NEE) provides a detailed methodology, stating that FPL estimates uncollectible accounts using a percentage derived from historical revenue and write-off trends over the previous four months, while NEER applies a percentage based on historical bad debt write-off trends for retail operations and uses specific identification for other receivables. Southern Company (SO) includes its Allowance for Doubtful Accounts within its Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts, covering the years 2021 through 2023, though it does not disclose specific estimation methods or figures. These differences reveal that while DUK emphasizes macroeconomic risk factors, NEE provides a quantified and segmented approach, and SO offers structured but opaque disclosure through its financial schedules.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: DUK links increased allowance for doubtful accounts to economic downturns and commodity price volatility, noting that these conditions could lead to higher bad debt expense due to customer payment defaults.",
        "Hop 2: NEE \u2192 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: NEE discloses specific estimation methods, including FPL's use of a four-month historical trend for provisioning and NEER's use of historical bad debt trends for retail operations, with specific identification applied to other receivables.",
        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: SO includes the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in its Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts covering 2021\u20132023, but does not provide detailed estimation methodologies or specific figures."

FPL recognizes costs associated with planned major nuclear maintenance in accordance with regulatory treatment. FPL defers nuclear maintenance costs for each nuclear unit's planned outage to a regulatory asset as the costs are incurred. FPL amortizes the costs to O&M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| NEER uses the deferral method to account for certain planned major maintenance costs. NEER's major maintenance costs for its nuclear generation units, combustion turbines and battery storage are capitalized (included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets) and amortized to O&M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of generally three months or less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Restricted Cash - At December 31, 2023 and 2022, NEE had approximately $730 million ($15 million for FPL) and $1,840 million ($33 million for FPL), respectively, of restricted cash, which is included in current other assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash is primarily related to debt service payments and margin cash collateral requirements at NEER and bond proceeds held for construction at FPL. In addition, where offsetting positions exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral of $194 million is netted against derivative assets and $815 million is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2023 and $7 million is netted against derivative assets and $1,541 million is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2022. See Note 3. |\n| Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments - NEE and FPL follow the current expected credit loss (CECL) model to account for credit losses for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Bad Debt - FPL maintains an accumulated provision for uncollectible customer accounts receivable that is estimated using a percentage, derived from historical revenue and write-off trends, of the previous four months of revenue, and includes estimates of credit and other losses based on both current events and forecasts. NEER regularly reviews collectibility of its receivables and establishes a provision for losses estimated as a percentage of accounts receivable based on the historical bad debt write-off trends for its retail electricity provider operations, as well as includes estimates for credit and other losses based on both current events and forecasts. When necessary, NEER uses the specific identification method for all other receivables.            |\n| Credit Losses - NEE's credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates. Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based on established standards and credit quality indicators. Credit quality indicators and standards that are closely monitored include credit ratings, certain financial ratios and delinquency trends which are based off the latest available information. Customers not meeting minimum standards provide various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit, the posting of margin cash collateral or use of master netting arrangements.                                                                                                                                                     |\n| For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, NEE recorded approximately $77 million, $113 million and $146 million of bad debt expense, including credit losses, respectively, which are included in O&M expenses in NEE's consolidated statements of income. The amounts recorded in 2021 primarily relate to credit losses at NEER driven by the operational and energy market impacts of severe prolonged winter weather in Texas in February 2021 (February 2021 weather event). The estimate for credit losses related to the impacts of the February 2021 weather event was developed based on NEE's assessment of the ultimate collectability of these receivables.                                                                                                                                                |\n| Inventory - FPL values materials, supplies and fuel inventory using a weighted-average cost method. NEER's materials, supplies and fuel inventories, which include emissions allowances and renewable energy credits, are carried at the lower of weighted-average cost and net realizable value, unless evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost will be recovered with a normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Energy Trading - NEE provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load- following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to optimize the value of electricity and fuel contracts, generation facilities and gas infrastructure assets, as well as to take advantage of projected favorable commodity price movements.

      "answer": "DUK notes a $253 million decrease in fuel and purchased power expenses due to lower deferred fuel amortization, which indirectly reflects how regulatory asset amortization impacts operating costs. NEE explicitly states that the net regulatory liability, which includes differences in deferred income taxes under regulatory versus accounting rules, totaled $2,916 million at year-end 2024 and is being amortized over the lives of the associated assets. SO provides a detailed breakdown showing that the amortization of regulatory assets contributed to a reclassification adjustment of $9 million in 2024, reducing the Southern Company Gas segment's net regulatory liabilities. Together, these disclosures illustrate how each utility manages regulatory asset amortization differently\u2014DUK through cost deferrals, NEE through tax-based regulatory liabilities, and SO through direct balance sheet reclassifications\u2014highlighting varied regulatory strategies affecting income tax expense and rate recovery.",

Southern Company (SO), in contrast, reported no tax fees across all its subsidiaries in both 2020 and 2021, with audit and audit-related fees dominating its external service costs.

          "chunk_text": "Duke Energy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance coverage with third parties for certain losses above a per occurrence and/or aggregate retention. Receivables for reinsurance coverage are recognized when realization is deemed probable.\n\n## Unamortized Debt Premium, Discount and Expense\n\nPremiums, discounts and expenses incurred with the issuance of outstanding long-term debt are amortized over the term of the debt issue. The gain or loss on extinguishment associated with refinancing higher-cost debt obligations in the regulated operations is amortized over the remaining life of the original instrument. Amortization expense is recorded as Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and is reflected as Depreciation, amortization and accretion within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nPremiums, discounts and expenses are presented as an adjustment to the carrying value of the debt amount and included in Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets presented.\n\n## Preferred Stock\n\nPreferred stock is reviewed to determine the appropriate balance sheet classification and embedded features, such as call options, are evaluated to determine if they should be bifurcated and accounted for separately. Costs directly related to the issuance of preferred stock are recorded as a reduction of the proceeds received. The liability for the dividend is recognized when declared. The accumulated dividends on the cumulative preferred stock is recognized to net income available to Duke Energy Corporation in the EPS calculation. See Note 19 for further information.\n\n## Loss Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities\n\nContingent losses are recorded when it is probable a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of the probable loss exists and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is recorded. Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred.\n\nEnvironmental liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental remediation or other liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Environmental expenditures related to past operations that do not generate current or future revenues are expensed. Environmental expenditures related to operations that generate current or future revenues are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Certain environmental expenditures receive regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded as regulatory assets.\n\nSee Notes 3 and 4 for further information.\n\n## Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\n\nDuke Energy maintains qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans. Eligible employees of the Subsidiary Registrants participate in the respective qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans and the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of benefit costs. See Note 22 for further information, including significant accounting policies associated with these plans.\n\n## Severance and Special Termination Benefits\n\nDuke Energy has severance plans under which in general, the longer a terminated employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount of severance benefits. A liability for involuntary severance is recorded once an involuntary severance plan is committed to by management if involuntary severances are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For involuntary severance benefits incremental to its ongoing severance plan benefits, the fair value of the obligation is expensed at the communication date if there are no future service requirements or over the required future service period. Duke Energy also offers special termination benefits under voluntary severance programs. Special termination benefits are recorded immediately upon employee acceptance absent a significant retention period. Otherwise, the cost is recorded over the remaining service period. Employee acceptance of voluntary severance benefits is determined by management based on the facts and circumstances of the benefits being offered. See Note 20 for further information.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nIf necessary, liabilities are recognized at the time of issuance or material modification of a guarantee for the estimated fair value of the obligation it assumes. Fair value is estimated using a probability weighted approach. The obligation is reduced over the term of the guarantee or related contract in a systematic and rational method as risk is reduced. Duke Energy recognizes a liability for the best estimate of its loss due to the nonperformance of the guaranteed party. This liability is recognized at the inception of a guarantee and is updated periodically. See Note 7 for further information.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation represents costs related to stock-based awards granted to employees and Board of Directors members. Duke Energy recognizes stock-based compensation based upon the estimated fair value of awards, net of estimated forfeitures at the date of issuance. The recognition period for these costs begins at either the applicable service inception date or grant date and continues throughout the requisite service period. Compensation cost is recognized as expense or capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment. See Note 21 for further information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nDuke Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and foreign jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants are parties to a tax-sharing agreement with Duke Energy. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities because the differences create taxable or tax-deductible amounts for future periods. ITCs associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties. For ITCs associated with nonregulated operations see 'Accounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits.'",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nNEER's interest expense for 2021 decreased approximately $292 million primarily reflecting $251 million of favorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments.\n\n## Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees\n\nNEER recognized $666 million of equity in earnings of equity method investees in 2021 compared to $1,351 million of equity in losses of equity method investees for the prior year. The change for 2021 primarily reflects the absence of an impairment charge related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in 2020 and higher equity in earnings of NEP recorded in 2021 primarily due to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. Due to continued legal and regulatory challenges related to Mountain Valley Pipeline, NextEra Energy Resources also recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of 2022 of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax). See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\n\n## Tax Credits, Benefits and Expenses\n\nPTCs from wind projects and ITCs from solar and certain wind projects are reflected in NEER's earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. Reflected in income taxes in NEE's consolidated statements of income are PTCs totaling approximately $90 million and $150 million and ITCs totaling approximately $237 million and $133 million in  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  A  portion  of  the  PTCs  and  ITCs  have  been  allocated  to  investors  in  connection  with  sales  of  differential membership interests. See Note 1 - Income Taxes for a discussion of PTCs and ITCs and Note 5.\n\n## Corporate and Other: Results of Operations\n\nCorporate and Other at NEE is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to NextEra Energy Resources. Interest expense is allocated  based  on  a  deemed  capital  structure  of  70%  debt  and  differential  membership  interests  sold  by  NextEra  Energy  Resources' subsidiaries.\n\nCorporate and Other's results increased $268 million during 2021 primarily due to favorable after-tax impacts of approximately $370 million, as compared to the prior year, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. The favorable non-qualifying hedge activity was partly offset by higher interest and refinancing costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures (see Note 15 - Commitments), investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses (see Note 6), payment of maturing debt and related derivative obligations (see Note 13 and Note 3) and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors and  sales  of  assets  to  NEP  or  third  parties  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interest), consistent with NEE's and FPL's objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.\n\nIn  October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $150 million of common units representing limited partner interests  in  NEP.  Under  the  program,  purchases  may  be  made  in  amounts,  at  prices  and  at  such  times  as  NEE  or  its  subsidiaries  deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Any purchases will be made in such quantities, at such prices, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as determined by NEE or its subsidiaries in their discretion, based on factors such as market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common unit purchase program does not require NEE to acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated  by  NEE  at  any  time.  The  purpose  of  the  program  is  not  to  cause  NEP's  common  units  to  be  delisted  from  the  New  York  Stock Exchange or to cause the common units to be deregistered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2021, the dollar value of units that may yet be purchased by NEE under this program was $114 million. At December 31, 2021, NEE owned a noncontrolling general partner interest in NEP and beneficially owned approximately 55.0% of NEP's voting power.",

Forward-looking statem ents are based on m anagem ent's beliefs and assum ptions and can often be identified by term s and phrases that include 'anticipate,' 'believe,' 'intend,' 'estim ate,' 'expect,' 'continue,' 'should,' 'could,' 'm ay,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'predict,' 'will,' 'potential,' 'forecast,' 'target,' 'guidance,' 'outlook' or other sim ilar term inology. Various factors m ay cause actual results to be m aterially different than the suggested outcom es within forward-looking statem ents; accordingly, there is no assurance that such results will be realized. T hese factors include, but are not lim ited to:\n\n- The ability to im plem ent our business strategy, including m eeting forecasted load growth dem and, grid and fleet m odernization objectives, and our carbon em ission reduction goals, while balancing custom er reliability and affordability;\n- State, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives, including costs of com pliance with existing and future environm ental requirem ents and/or uncertainty of applicability or changes to such legislative and regulatory initiatives, including those related to clim ate change, as well as rulings that affect cost and investm ent recovery or have an im pact on rate structures or m arket prices;\n- The extent and tim ing of costs and liabilities to com ply with federal and state laws, regulations and legal requirem ents related to coal ash rem ediation, including am ounts for required closure of certain ash im poundm ents, are uncertain and difficult to estim ate;\n- The ability to tim ely recover eligible costs, including am ounts associated with coal ash im poundm ent retirem ent obligations, asset retirem ent and construction costs related to carbon em issions reductions, and costs related to significant weather events, and to earn an adequate return on investm ent through rate case proceedings and the regulatory process;\n- The costs of decom m issioning nuclear facilities could prove to be m ore extensive than am ounts estim ated and all costs m ay not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process;\n- The im pact of extraordinary external events, such

intelligence;\n- Additional com petition in electric and natural gas m arkets and continued industry consolidation;\n- The influence of weather and other natural phenom ena on operations, financial position, and cash flows, including the econom ic, operational and other effects of severe storm s, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and tornadoes, including extrem e weather associated with clim ate change;\n- Changing or conflicting investor, custom er and other stakeholder expectations and dem ands, particularly regarding environm ental, social and governance m atters and costs related thereto;\n- The ability to successfully operate electric generating facilities and deliver electricity to custom ers including direct or indirect effects to the C om pany resulting from  an incident that affects the U nited States electric grid or generating resources;\n- Operational interruptions to our natural gas distribution and transm ission activities;\n- The availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply;\n- The im pact on facilities and business from  a terrorist or other attack, war, vandalism , cybersecurity threats, data security

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAn impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset's fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate.\n\n## Carrying Value of Equity Method Investments\n\nNEE tests its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nIndicators of impairment may include, but are not limited to, a series of operating losses of an investee, the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity and a current fair value of an investment that may be less than its carrying value. If indicators of impairment exist, an estimate of the investment's fair value will be calculated. A pproaches for estimating fair value include, among others, an income approach using a probability-weighted discounted cash flows model, a market approach using an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple model, and a market observable transaction. The probability assigned to each scenario as well as the cash flows and EBITDA  multiple identified are critical in determining fair v alue.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAn impairment loss is required to be recognized if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary . A ssessment of whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired involves, among other factors, consideration of the length of time that the fair value is below the carrying value, current expected performance relativ e to the ex pected performance when the investment was initially made, performance relative to peers, industry performance relative to the economy , credit rating, regulatory actions and legal and permitting challenges. If management is unable to reasonably assert that an impairment is temporary or believes that there will not be full recov ery  of the carry ing v alue of its inv estment, then the impairment is considered to be other than temporary . Investments that are other than temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated fair value and cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value. Impairment losses are recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair V alue Measurements.\n\n## Decommissioning and Dismantlement\n\nNEE accounts for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively , A ROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair v alue of an A RO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. NEE's A ROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nThe calculation of the future cost of retiring long-liv ed assets, including nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement costs, involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate  with  inflation.  In  addition,  NEE  also  makes  interest  rate  and  rate  of  return  projections  on  its  inv estments  in  determining  recommended  funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Periodically , NEE is required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed escalation rates for nuclear decommissioning costs would increase NEE's AROs at December 31, 2024 by approximately $208 million.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nFPL -For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are approved by the FPSC. The most recent studies, filed in 2020, reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL's nuclear units at the time of the studies. FPL's portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $9.6 billion, or $2.5 billion expressed in 2024 dollars. The ultimate costs of decommissioning reflect the applications submitted to the NRC for the extension of St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 licenses for an additional 20 years, as well as the license renewals for Turkey Point Units No. 3 and 4 approved in 2024.",

The cost estimates for Georgia Power and Mississippi Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some surface impoundments and closure by removal for others. These estimated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are refined and compliance activities continue. Current estimates of these costs through 2029 are provided in the table below. Material expenditures in future years for ARO settlements will also be required for surface impoundments, nuclear decommissioning (for Alabama Power and Georgia Power), and other liabilities reflected in the applicable Registrants' AROs, as discussed further in Note 6 to the financial statements.

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reports customer deposits of $144 million for Duke Energy Progress and $200 million for Duke Energy Florida as of December 31, 2021. NextEra Energy (NEE) reports customer deposits of $478 million for the same period. Southern Company (SO) reports customer deposits of $479 million as of December 31, 2021. This reveals that NEE and SO have significantly larger customer deposit liabilities compared to DUK, suggesting a larger customer base or higher average deposits per customer, which could reflect differences in service area size, customer density, or billing practices.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy (DUK) paid $14.5 million in total fees, of which $14.0 million (96.6%) were audit fees. NextEra Energy (NEE) paid $4.8 million in total fees, with $4.4 million (91.7%) allocated to audit fees. Southern Company (SO) had varying subsidiaries, but combining Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas, the total fees were approximately $20.5 million, with $14.3 million (69.8%) spent on audit fees. DUK and NEE show a high concentration in audit fees, indicating a strong reliance on external audit services, while SO\u2019s broader distribution suggests a more diversified external service cost structure.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Duke Energy (DUK) reported $1.5 million in audit-related fees across its consolidated subsidiaries, indicating a relatively streamlined compliance structure. NextEra Energy (NEE) reported $752,000 in audit-related fees, suggesting a more centralized or efficient compliance approach despite its large scale. Southern Company (SO) showed significant variation across its subsidiaries: Georgia Power reported $57,000, Mississippi Power reported $83,000, Southern Power reported $1.692 million, and Southern Company Gas reported $673,000 in audit-related fees. The wide disparity in fees among SO\u2019s subsidiaries reflects differing regulatory environments and operational complexities across their service territories. Collectively, these figures suggest that DUK and NEE maintain more uniform compliance strategies, while SO\u2019s strategy is more decentralized and influenced by the specific regulatory demands of each subsidiary\u2019s jurisdiction.",

Southern Company reported $3,899 million in regulated gas distribution revenue and $516 million in gas marketing services (nonregulated), indicating a dominant position in regulated gas with a smaller but notable presence in nonregulated activities. In contrast, NextEra Energy reported $2,121 million in total operating revenue but did not break out regulated vs. nonregulated gas revenue, and its operating loss of $51 million suggests a different business mix or challenges in its gas operations. Together, these figures highlight varying degrees of reliance on regulated gas distribution and differing financial outcomes in 2024.",

      "question": "How do DUK, NEE, and SO differ in their financial reporting and strategic treatment of Asset Retirement Obligations, and what does this reveal about their long-term infrastructure liabilities and regulatory compliance approaches?",
      "answer": "DUK reports a decrease in its Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) from $1,008 million in 2020 to $877 million in 2021 for noncurrent liabilities, with $110 million in current ARO in 2021, indicating a reduction in near-term decommissioning liabilities. NEE shows an increase in ARO from $1,871 million in 2020 to $2,049 million in 2021, suggesting growing long-term obligations tied to asset retirements. SO explicitly references ARO in its financial note structure (Note 6), signaling a dedicated focus on retirement obligations, though specific figures are not provided. Together, these disclosures reflect varying trends and reporting granularity in how each utility manages and discloses its infrastructure retirement liabilities.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy operates under a FPSC-mandated capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt, with a corresponding ROE band of 8.85% to 10.85%, indicating regulatory control over its financing mix to ensure stability and fair returns. NextEra Energy, through its subsidiary NEER, applies a 70% debt capital structure for allocating interest expense, suggesting a more aggressive, debt-heavy financing strategy that may enhance returns but also increase financial risk. Southern Company does not explicitly disclose its capital structure in the provided evidence, implying a potentially more flexible or internally managed approach, though likely aligned with industry norms and regulatory expectations. Together, these reflect a spectrum of utility financing strategies\u2014externally mandated, internally optimized, and potentially hybrid\u2014each balancing regulatory oversight, cost of capital, and shareholder returns differently.",

See Note 22 for additional detail.\n\n## 2021 Settlement Agreement\n\nOn January 14, 2021, Duke Energy Florida filed a Settlement Agreement (the '2021 Settlement') with the FPSC. The parties to the 2021 Settlement include Duke Energy Florida, the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, White Springs Agricultural Chemicals, Inc. d/b/a PCS Phosphate and NUCOR Steel Florida, Inc. (collectively, the 'Parties').\n\nPursuant to the 2021 Settlement, the Parties agreed to a base rate stay-out provision that expires year-end 2024; however, Duke Energy Florida is allowed an increase to its base rates of an incremental $67 million in 2022, $49 million in 2023 and $79 million in 2024, subject to adjustment in the event of tax reform during the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Parties also agreed to an ROE band of 8.85% to 10.85% with a midpoint of 9.85% based on a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt. The ROE band can be increased by 25 basis points if the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate increases 50 basis points or more over a six-month period in which case the midpoint ROE would rise from 9.85% to 10.10%. Duke Energy Florida will also be able to retain the retail portion of the DOE award of approximately $173 million for spent nuclear fuel, which is expected to be received in 2022, in order to mitigate customer rates over the term of the 2021 Settlement. In return, Duke Energy Florida will be able to recognize the $173 million into earnings from 2022 through 2024.\n\nIn addition to these terms, the 2021 Settlement contained provisions related to the accelerated depreciation of Crystal River Units 4-5, the approval of approximately $1 billion in future investments in new cost-effective solar power, the implementation of a new Electric Vehicle Charging Station Program and the deferral and recovery of costs in connection with the implementation of Duke Energy Florida's Vision Florida program, which explores various emerging non-carbon emitting generation technology, distributed technologies and resiliency projects, among other things. The 2021 Settlement also resolved remaining unrecovered storm costs for Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe FPSC approved the 2021 Settlement on May 4, 2021, issuing an order on June 4, 2021. Revised customer rates became effective January 1, 2022, with subsequent base rate increases effective January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each account for asset retirement obligations (ARO), and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to long-lived asset retirement liabilities in the utilities sector?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) records AROs only when a legal obligation exists and the cost can be reasonably estimated, excluding assets with indeterminate lives like transmission and distribution facilities from ARO recognition. For regulated operations, DUK accrues removal costs based on regulatory orders, treating them as regulatory liabilities rather than AROs. NextEra Energy (NEE) recognizes AROs for nuclear, wind, and solar facilities, with an ARO of $1.1 billion as of 2021, and estimates the ultimate decommissioning cost for its nuclear plants at $9.4 billion, with a portion expressed in 2021 dollars at $2.1 billion. NEE also maintains restricted decommissioning funds included in special use funds on its balance sheet. Southern Company (SO) references AROs in its glossary, indicating awareness of the accounting standard but does not provide detailed disclosures on its ARO liabilities or methodology for estimating them. This reveals that DUK takes a conservative approach by excluding indeterminate-life assets, NEE provides detailed estimates and funding mechanisms for decommissioning, and SO offers minimal transparency on AROs, suggesting a more passive or less disclosed approach to asset retirement liabilities.",

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nDuke Energy records an ARO when it has a legal obligation to incur retirement costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Certain assets of the Duke Energy Registrants have an indeterminate life, such as transmission and distribution facilities, and thus the fair value of the retirement obligation is not reasonably estimable. A liability for these AROs will be recorded when a fair value is determinable.\n\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' regulated operations accrue costs of removal for property that does not have an associated legal retirement obligation based on regulatory orders from state commissions. These costs of removal are recorded as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment. The Duke Energy Registrants do not accrue the estimated cost of removal for any nonregulated assets. See Note 3 for the estimated cost of removal for assets without an associated legal retirement obligation, which are included in Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe following table presents the AROs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n",

The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning or dismantlement activities are expected to be complete. See Note 11. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NEER's ARO was approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and was primarily determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning or dismantlement. NEER's portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs  associated  with  spent  fuel  storage  above  what  is  expected  to  be  refunded  by  the  DOE  under  a  spent  fuel  settlement  agreement,  is estimated  to  be  approximately  $9.4  billion,  or  $2.1  billion  expressed  in  2021  dollars.  The  ultimate  cost  to  dismantle  NEER's  wind  and  solar facilities is estimated to be approximately $2.0 billion.\n\nSeabrook  files  a  comprehensive  nuclear  decommissioning  study  with  the  New  Hampshire  Nuclear  Decommissioning  Financing  Committee (NDFC) every four years; the most recent study was filed in 2019. Seabrook's decommissioning funding plan is also subject to annual review by the NDFC. Currently, there are no ongoing decommissioning funding requirements for Seabrook, Duane Arnold and Point Beach, however, the NRC, and in the case of Seabrook, the NDFC, has the authority to require additional funding in the future. NEER's portion of Seabrook's, Duane Arnold's  and  Point  Beach's  restricted  funds  for  the  payment  of  future  expenditures  to  decommission  these  plants  is  included  in  nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities held in the decommissioning  funds  are  primarily  carried  at  fair  value.  See  Note  4.  Market  adjustments  for  debt  securities  result  in  a  corresponding adjustment  to  other  comprehensive  income  (OCI),  except  for  estimated  credit  losses  and  unrealized  losses  on  debt  securities  intended  or required to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are recognized in other - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Market  adjustments  for  equity  securities  are  recorded  in  change  in  unrealized  gains  (losses)  on  equity  securities  held  in  NEER's  nuclear decommissioning funds - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses are recognized in income and are reinvested in the funds. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\n\nMajor Maintenance Costs - FPL expenses costs associated with planned maintenance for its non-nuclear electric generation plants as incurred. FPL  recognizes  costs  associated  with  planned  major  nuclear  maintenance  in  accordance  with  regulatory  treatment.  FPL  defers  nuclear maintenance costs for each nuclear unit's planned outage to a regulatory asset as the costs are incurred. FPL amortizes the costs to O&amp;M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\n\nNEER uses  the  deferral  method  to  account  for  certain  planned  major  maintenance  costs.  NEER's  major  maintenance  costs  for  its  nuclear generation  units  and  combustion  turbines  are  capitalized  (included  in  noncurrent  other  assets  on  NEE's  consolidated  balance  sheets)  and amortized to O&amp;M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\n\nCash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n\nRestricted Cash - At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NEE had approximately $677 million ($53 million for FPL) and $441 million ($135 million for FPL),  respectively,  of  restricted  cash,  of  which  approximately  $677  million  ($53  million  for  FPL)  and  $374  million  ($93  million  for  FPL), respectively,  are  included  in  current  other  assets  and  the  remaining  balances  are  included  in  noncurrent  other  assets  on  NEE's  and  FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash is primarily related to debt service payments and margin cash collateral requirements at NEER and bond proceeds held for construction at FPL. In addition, where offsetting positions exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral of $121 million is netted against derivative assets and $172 million is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2021 and $183 million is netted against derivative assets and $136 million is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2020. See Note 3.\n\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments - Effective January 1, 2020, NEE and FPL adopted an accounting standards update that provides for a new methodology, the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, to account for credit losses for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost. On January 1, 2020, NEE recorded a reduction to retained earnings of approximately $11 million representing the cumulative effect of adopting the new standards update, which primarily related to the impact of applying the CECL model to NEER's receivables. The impact of adopting the new standards update was not material to FPL. See also Note 4 - Special Use Funds.\n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Bad Debt - FPL maintains an accumulated provision for uncollectible customer accounts receivable that is estimated  using  a  percentage,  derived  from  historical  revenue  and  write-off  trends,  of  the  previous  four  months  of  revenue,  and  includes estimates of  credit  and  other  losses  based  on  both  current  events  and  forecasts.  NEER  regularly  reviews  collectibility  of  its  receivables  and establishes a provision for losses estimated as a percentage of accounts receivable based on the historical bad debt write-off trends for its retail electricity  provider  operations,  as  well  as  includes  estimates  for  credit  and  other  losses  based  on  both  current  events  and  forecasts.  When necessary, NEER uses the specific identification method for all other receivables.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each account for unbilled revenues in their financial disclosures, and what do their respective amounts and approaches reveal about differences in revenue recognition practices and customer billing cycles across the utilities sector?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) recognizes unbilled revenues by applying customer billing rates to estimated volumes of energy delivered but not yet billed, and includes these in Receivables and Receivables of VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Specific unbilled amounts for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana were $87 million and $134 million as of December 31, 2020, and $82 million and $121 million as of December 31, 2021, respectively. Additionally, Duke Energy sells nearly all of its retail accounts receivable, including unbilled revenues, to an affiliate, CRC, treating these transfers as sales, removing them from the balance sheet.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) recognizes unbilled revenues as part of customer receivables on its consolidated balance sheets, with Florida Power & Light (FPL) reporting $583 million in unbilled revenues as of December 31, 2021, and $454 million as of December 31, 2020. FPL recognizes revenue as electricity is delivered and bills customers monthly, with unbilled amounts representing the value of electricity delivered but not yet invoiced. NEE also notes that unbilled revenues are treated similarly to billed receivables in terms of credit risk management and payment terms.\n\nSouthern Company (SO) reports unbilled revenues as a line item within current assets, with amounts of $711 million as of December 31, 2021, and $672 million as of December 31, 2020. These unbilled revenues are disclosed in the balance sheet but without detailed explanation of recognition methodology or specific customer segments.\n\nComparing these disclosures, Duke Energy's approach involves third-party transfers and removal from the balance sheet, NextEra provides a detailed breakdown of timing and methodology, and Southern Company reports the metric in aggregate without further context. These differences suggest varied approaches to managing unbilled revenues, reflecting distinct operational and accounting practices within the utilities sector.",

Accordingly, the receivables sold are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 for further information. These receivables for unbilled revenues are $82 million and $121 million for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, and $87 million and $134 million for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\n\n(c)    Due to certain customer financial hardships created by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders, Duke Energy permitted customers to defer payment of past-due amounts through an installment payment plan over a period of several months.\n\n## 19. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities and accumulated preferred dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities and accumulated preferred dividends, by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock, such as equity forward sale agreements, were exercised or settled. Duke Energy's participating securities are RSUs that are entitled to dividends declared on Duke Energy common stock during the RSUs vesting periods. Dividends declared on preferred stock are recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of net income to arrive at net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders. Dividends accumulated on preferred stock are an adjustment to net income used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nIn  December 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources sold a 90% noncontrolling ownership interest, comprised of a 50% ownership interest  to  a  third  party  and  a  40%  ownership  interest  to  a  NEP  subsidiary,  in  a  portfolio  of  three  wind  generation  facilities  and  four  solar generation facilities in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. representing a total net generating capacity of 900 MW. In addition, in December 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources also sold its 100% ownership interest in a 100 MW solar generation facility and a 30 MW battery storage facility  (solar-plus-storage  facility)  under  construction  in Arizona  to  a  NEP  subsidiary.  Total  cash  proceeds  for  these  two separate  transactions  totaled  approximately  $656  million.  NEER  continued  to  consolidate  the  projects  until  the  sale  was  recognized  for accounting purposes, see Note 9 - NEER. A NextEra Energy Resources affiliate will continue to operate the facilities included in the sale. In connection with the 90% sale, noncontrolling interests of approximately $689 million and a reduction to additional paid-in capital of approximately $188 million ($165 million after tax) were recorded on NEE's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020. In connection with the solarplus-storage facility transaction, approximately $155 million of cash received was recorded as a contract liability, which is included in current other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020. The solar-plus-storage facility achieved commercial operations in June 2021 and the contract liability was reversed and the sale was recognized for accounting purposes.\n\nIn 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale of its ownership interest in two solar generation facilities located in Spain with a total generating capacity of 99.8 MW, which resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately \u20ac111 million (approximately $121 million). In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $270 million (pretax and after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net.\n\nIn 2019, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale of ownership interests in three wind generation facilities and three solar generation facilities, including noncontrolling interests in two of the solar facilities, located in the Midwest and West regions of the U.S. with a total net generating capacity of 611 MW to a NEP subsidiary for cash proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion, plus working capital of $12 million. A NextEra Energy Resources affiliate will continue to operate the facilities included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $341 million ($259 million after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net, and noncontrolling interests of approximately $118 million were recorded on NEE's consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## 2. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the  entity  expects  to  be  entitled  in  exchange  for  those  goods  and  services.  The  promised  goods  or  services  in  the  majority  of  NEE's contracts with customers is, at FPL, for the delivery of electricity based on tariff rates approved by the FPSC and, at NEER, for the delivery of energy commodities and the availability of electric capacity and electric transmission.\n\nFPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE's operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers, as well as  derivative  and  lease  transactions  at  NEER.  For  the  vast  majority  of  contracts  with  customers,  NEE  believes  that  the  obligation  to  deliver energy, capacity or transmission is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as NEE performs. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, NEE's revenue from contracts with customers was approximately $18.8 billion ($14.1 billion at FPL), $17.0 billion ($13.0 billion at FPL) and $17.5 billion ($13.6 billion at FPL), respectively. NEE's and FPL's receivables are primarily associated with revenues earned from contracts with customers, as well as derivative and lease transactions at NEER, and consist of both billed and unbilled amounts, which are recorded in customer receivables and other receivables on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Receivables represent unconditional rights to consideration and reflect the differences in timing of revenue recognition and cash collections. For substantially all of NEE's and FPL's receivables, regardless of the type of revenue transaction from which the receivable originated, customer and counterparty credit risk is managed in the same manner and the terms and conditions of payment are similar. During 2021, NEER did not recognize approximately $180 million of revenue related to reimbursable expenses from a counterparty that are deemed not probable of collection. These reimbursable expenses arose from  the  impacts  of  the  February  2021  weather  event.  These  determinations  were  made  based  on  assessments  of  the  counterparty's creditworthiness and NEER's ability to collect.\n\nFPL -  FPL's  revenues  are  derived  primarily  from  tariff-based  sales  that  result  from  providing  electricity  to  retail  customers  in  Florida  with  no defined contractual term. Electricity sales to retail customers account for approximately 90% of FPL's 2021 operating revenues, the majority of which are to residential customers. FPL's retail customers receive a bill monthly based on the amount of monthly kWh usage with payment due monthly. For these types of sales, FPL recognizes revenue as electricity is delivered and billed to customers, as well as an estimate for electricity delivered and not yet billed. The billed and unbilled amounts represent the value of electricity delivered to the customer. At December 31, 2021 and  2020,  FPL's  unbilled  revenues  amounted  to  approximately  $583  million  and  $454  million,  respectively,  and  are  included  in  customer receivables on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to certain  power  purchase  agreements  with  maturity  dates  through  2041.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  FPL  expects  to  record  approximately $400 million of revenues related to the fixed capacity price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) holds significant ownership stakes in several power generation facilities, including 87.27% in W.S. Lee CC and 50.05% in Gibson Unit 5, indicating a diversified approach to capital deployment across various assets. NextEra Energy (NEE) has a 25% ownership stake in Scherer Unit No. 3 and a 91.19% stake in Wyman Station Unit No. 4, suggesting a strategic focus on both shared and fully controlled facilities to optimize capital investment. Southern Company (SO) holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which reflects a collaborative capital deployment model, particularly for large-scale nuclear projects. These differing ownership structures reveal distinct capital strategies: DUK emphasizes diversified asset control, NEE balances between shared and full ownership, and SO focuses on joint ventures for high-cost infrastructure.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) compare in their operating revenues and cost structures based on recent filings, and what does this reveal about their utility business models?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reported total operating revenues of $29.06 billion for 2023, with operating income of $7.07 billion. Its cost structure includes significant seasonal variations, with the third quarter showing the highest revenues at $7.994 billion, likely reflecting peak energy demand. NextEra Energy (NEE) reported consolidated operating revenues of $17.069 billion in 2021, with its Florida Power & Light (FPL) segment contributing $14.102 billion. NEE\u2019s cost structure reflects a heavy emphasis on operating expenses at $14.233 billion, driven by its capital-intensive utility and renewable energy operations. Southern Company (SO) reported operating revenues of $10.118 billion in 2023, with a decrease of $1.466 billion from the prior year. Its operating expenses totaled $7.299 billion, with depreciation and amortization rising to $1.681 billion, indicating a growing asset base and infrastructure investment. The comparative analysis reveals that DUK maintains a diversified and stable revenue model with consistent quarterly performance, NEE leverages its dominant FPL utility and broader energy services for significant consolidated revenues, and SO shows signs of revenue contraction but increased capital investment, suggesting a transitional phase in its utility operations.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) defines AFUDC in its 10-K filing as 'Allowance for funds used during construction,' but does not provide specific dollar figures or project-level allocations for AFUDC. In contrast, NextEra Energy (NEE) explicitly discloses AFUDC amounts in its capital expenditure forecasts, including $75 million in 2022 and declining to $40 million by 2026 for one category, and $50 million in 2022 falling to zero by 2026 in another. Southern Company (SO) also defines AFUDC in its glossary as 'Allowance for funds used during construction,' but similar to DUK, does not quantify AFUDC in its disclosures or tie it to specific projects. These differences in transparency\u2014NEE providing detailed forecasts while DUK and SO offer only definitional references\u2014could affect the ability of investors and regulators to assess the true cost and financing burden of ongoing capital projects, with NEE\u2019s disclosures enabling more precise financial modeling and potentially more informed regulatory decisions.",
