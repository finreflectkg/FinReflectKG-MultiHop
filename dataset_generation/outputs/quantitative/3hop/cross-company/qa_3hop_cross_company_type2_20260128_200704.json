      "answer": "In 2024, Cisco reports a current portion of long-term debt of $488 million, Intel shows $3,729 million, and Texas Instruments discloses $750 million. These figures indicate differing liquidity pressures: Intel faces significantly higher near-term debt obligations compared to both Cisco and Texas Instruments, suggesting a more front-loaded maturity schedule. Cisco\u2019s low current portion suggests a longer-dated debt structure, while Texas Instruments maintains a moderate level, reflecting a balanced maturity profile.",

        "Hop 1: CSCO \u2192 Current portion of long-term debt: Discloses $488 million as the current portion of long-term debt for 2024, indicating minimal short-term repayment pressure.",

        "Hop 3: TXN \u2192 Current portion of long-term debt: Lists $750 million as the current portion of long-term debt for 2024, reflecting moderate short-term debt exposure compared to the other two firms."

      "question": "How have AMD, CSCO, and INTC each experienced or projected changes in gross margin percentage in 2024, and what do these variations indicate about their respective operational or market challenges?",
      "answer": "In 2024, AMD cited inventory write-downs due to excess or obsolete inventory as a factor negatively impacting gross margins, particularly in markets with short product lifecycles and unpredictable customer demand. CSCO reported an improvement in gross margin percentage, increasing from 62.7% in the prior year to 64.7% in fiscal year 2024, indicating stronger cost control or pricing power. INTC, on the other hand, noted a decline in gross margin percentage due to a shift in product mix toward lower-margin offerings, such as the Intel Core Ultra 200V processors manufactured externally. These differences highlight AMD's vulnerability to demand volatility, CSCO's effective cost and pricing strategy, and INTC's margin pressure from strategic product transitions and external manufacturing dependencies.",

As AI capabilities improv e and are increasingly adopted, we may see more sophisticated threats created through the use of AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated cyberattacks. These attacks could be crafted with an AI tool to directly attack IT  Systems with increased speed and/or efficiency than a human threat actor or create more effectiv e phishing emails. In addition, the threat could be introduced from the result of our or our customers and business partners incorporating the output of an AI tool that includes a threat, such  as  introducing  malicious  code  by  incorporating  AI  generated  source  code.  Our  network  and  storage  applications,  as  well  as  those  of  our customers,  business  partners,  and  third-party  prov iders,  may  be  subject  to  unauthorized  access  by  hackers  or  breached  due  to  operator  error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.\n\nCyberattacks that breach our security measures, or those of our third-party serv ice prov iders, customers or business partners, could result in any or all of the following, which indiv idually or collectiv ely could materially adv ersely affect our financial condition, our competitiv e position; unauthorized access to,  misuse or disclosure of Confidential Data (such as intellectual property, sensitiv e business information or personally identifiable information (PII)); reputational  harm  and/or  diminution  in  our  competitiv eness;  loss  of  existing  and/or  future  customers;  litigation  and/or  regulatory  inv estigations  or enforcement; significant remediation, restoration and compliance costs; and the div ersion of management's attention and key information technology resources. In addition, many gov ernments hav e enacted and are continuing to enact strict priv acy and security laws, such as the UK's and European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Priv acy Act of 2018 (CCPA), as amended by the California Priv acy Rights Act (CPRA), which prov ide for fines, penalties, and in the case of the CCPA and similar legislation, the basis for priv ate claims for certain types of data breaches. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to  upgrading  application,  computer,  and  network  security  components;  training  workers  to  maintain  and  monitor  our  security  controls;  inv estigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation or regulatory proceedings; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe typically sell our products pursuant to indiv idual purchase orders. We generally do not hav e long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inv entory lev els in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates prov ided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. T o the extent we fail  to  forecast  demand  and  product  mix  accurately  or  are  unable  to  increase  production  or  secure  sufficient  capacity  and  there  is  a  mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and hav e a material adv erse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inv entory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, our Embedded segment rev enue decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize their inv entory lev els. We may build inv entories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or ov erproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inv entory, which could result in write-downs of inv entory and an adv erse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiv ing certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products.\n\nExcess or obsolete inv entory hav e resulted in, and may in the future result in, write-downs of the v alue of our inv entory. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inv entory, a reduction in the av erage selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inv entory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressiv e pricing actions.",

It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM  to grow over time, driven by factors such as a larger installed base, demand for A I capabilities, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize, or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products have in the past and may in the future reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.\n\nImportant factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:\n\n- business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;\n- consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n- customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as the shift in data center spend to GPUs to support A I workloads;\n- geopolitical conditions, including trade policies, potential tariffs or other trade restrictions, and geopolitical tensions and conflicts;\n- our ability  to timely  introduce competitiv e products;\n- competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;\n- the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;\n- customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and\n- disruptions affecting customers, such as the delays in obtaining tools, components, and other supplies as a result of COV ID-19-related port shutdowns in China that negatively impacted demand for our business in 2022, as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021.\n\nOur pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our core product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms to higher-end platforms. Our ancillary product offerings that extend beyond our core product lines typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced products, and at times are not profitable. Some of our higher-priced products, however, such as the Intel Core Ultra 200V  processors launched in September 2024, have lower margins as they are produced at external foundries rather than in our manufacturing facilities. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-margin to lower-margin products in any of our market segments, as has been the case with the Intel Core Ultra 200V  processors, our gross margin percentage has decreased and may decrease again.\n\n## Macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including changes to trade policies and regulations, present significant risks to us in many jurisdictions.\n\nWe have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&amp;D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Our operations rely upon a supply chain that is also highly distributed, and with reliance in some instances on supplies or materials available in only one or more geographic areas. M oreover, sales outside the US accounted for 76% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, with revenue from billings to China contributing 29% of our total revenue. A s a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to execute our business strategy, manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.\n\nAdverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth; changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy; high interest rates; tighter credit; inflation; lower capital ex penditures by  businesses, including on IT infrastructure; increases in unemployment; and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. A n economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to: increased credit and collectability risks; higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets; reduced liquidity; adverse impacts on our suppliers; failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers; asset impairments; and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\n\nTrade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. They can also result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term",

Microsoft disclosed $275 billion in remaining performance obligations as of June 30, 2204, with 45% expected to be recognized within the next 12 months, reflecting its large enterprise contract base. NVIDIA reported $1.7 billion in remaining performance obligations from contracts longer than one year as of January 26, 2025, with approximately 39% to be recognized in the next twelve months, suggesting a more hardware-centric and shorter-duration contract structure.

      "answer": "Cisco reported restructuring and other charges of $6 million in fiscal year 2022, a significant decrease from $886 million in the prior year, indicating a reduction in restructuring activity. Intel disclosed restructuring and other charges but did not provide specific figures, instead categorizing them under a broader note on restructuring activities, suggesting a less transparent or more complex restructuring process. Texas Instruments reported restructuring and other charges of $54 million in 2021, up from $24 million in 2020, showing a continued investment in operational adjustments. Together, these figures suggest varying approaches to cost restructuring, with Cisco showing a sharp decline, Texas Instruments showing an upward trend, and Intel providing limited visibility into its restructuring costs.",

The Company's effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions.\n\nThe Company's effective tax  rate  for  2022  was  higher  compared  to  2021  due  primarily  to  a  higher  effective  tax  rate  on  foreign earnings, including the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, and lower tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nThe Company's material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations.\n\n## Debt\n\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.8 billion (collectively the 'Notes'), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes ('Commercial Paper') pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space.

The net 1.7 percentage points decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in prior year discrete tax expenses and state taxes.\n\nFor  a  full  reconciliation  of  our  effective  tax  rate  to  the  U.S.  federal  statutory  rate  of  21%  and  for  further  explanation  of  our provision for income taxes, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

      "answer": "Salesforce (CRM) states that its consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with all significant intercompany balances and transactions eliminated in consolidation. Intel (INTC) includes not only wholly-owned subsidiaries but also majority-owned subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements, indicating a broader consolidation model that encompasses both voting and variable interest entities. NVIDIA (NVDA) similarly consolidates its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with intercompany balances and transactions eliminated in consolidation. These disclosures suggest that while all three companies rely on wholly-owned subsidiaries as part of their corporate structure, Intel\u2019s approach extends further into majority-owned entities, potentially reflecting a more complex or diversified operational footprint compared to Salesforce and NVIDIA, which maintain tighter structural control through full ownership.",

      "answer": "AMD accrues warranty costs to Cost of Sales at the time of product sale, offering one to three-year limited warranties depending on product type and customer negotiation. AVGO accrues for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized, factoring in historical experience and specific product requirements, including occasional unanticipated quality issues. NVDA includes warranty costs in Cost of Revenue, estimating them at the point of revenue recognition, and also accrues for known warranty issues if a loss is probable and estimable. While all three companies recognize warranty liabilities proactively, AMD emphasizes variable warranty terms, AVGO highlights historical data and unexpected issues, and NVDA focuses on known issues and limited end-user warranties.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, AVGO reported $200 million in purchases of investments, indicating a limited focus on new investment activity. CSCO, on the other hand, spent $6,070 million on purchases of investments, suggesting a more aggressive strategy to deploy capital into financial instruments. MSFT had the highest level of investment activity with $26,456 million in purchases of investments, reflecting its broader capital deployment and diversification strategy. These differences highlight AVGO's conservative approach, CSCO's moderate investment stance, and MSFT's expansive financial asset strategy.",

      "question": "How do Accenture, Adobe, and Qualcomm each characterize their working capital requirements in 2022, and what does this reveal about their respective operational strategies and financial pressures?",
      "answer": "Accenture notes that its working capital, investments, and other funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and borrowing facilities, with $566 million in increased operating cash flow driven by higher net income. Adobe highlights increased working capital requirements as a risk factor, particularly due to integration challenges from acquisitions and potential delays in accounts receivable collections. Qualcomm reports a $4.5 billion net change in operating assets and liabilities, including elevated working capital needs driven by higher inventory, accounts receivable, and timing of integrated circuit shipments. Together, these perspectives show Accenture maintaining strong cash flow flexibility, Adobe facing integration-related working capital volatility, and Qualcomm experiencing significant near-term pressure from supply chain and inventory dynamics.",

For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Dispositions) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nFinancing activities: The $385 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders' Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nWe believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.\n\nSubstantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. In addition, domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.\n\n## Share Purchases and Redemptions\n\nWe  intend  to  continue  to  use  a  significant  portion  of  cash  generated  from  operations  for  share  repurchases  during  fiscal  2023.  The  number  of  shares  ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means.  The  repurchase  program  may  be  accelerated,  suspended,  delayed  or  discontinued  at  any  time,  without  notice.  For  additional  information,  see  Note  14 (Shareholders' Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'",

          "chunk_text": "\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to $4.9 billion in cash paid for acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired (primarily related to Veoneer), $3.2 billion in cash dividends paid, $3.1 billion in payments to repurchase shares of our common stock, $2.3 billion in capital expenditures and $766 million in payments of tax withholdings related to vesting of share-based awards. This was partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities, which was negatively impacted by advanced payments of $2.3 billion made to suppliers of our integrated circuit products under multi-year capacity commitments (which were included within other current assets and other assets), as well as $4.5 billion of net changes in other operating assets and liabilities (excluding the reversal of the 2018 EC fine), primarily consisting of increased working capital requirements, including higher inventory and related operating liabilities and an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher revenues combined with the timing of integrated circuit shipments during the period (net of an increase in amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable). We may continue to see elevated working capital requirements in the near term.\n\nDebt. In May 2022, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion of unsecured fixed-rate notes with varying maturities. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to repay $1.5 billion of fixed-rate notes that matured in May 2022. At September 25, 2022, we had $15.4 billion of principal floating- and fixed-rate notes outstanding, $1.4 billion of which matures in January 2023. The remaining debt has maturity dates in 2024 through 2052.\n\nWe have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $4.5 billion of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At September 25, 2022, we had $499 million of commercial paper outstanding.\n\nWe also have a Revolving Credit Facility, which provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $4.5 billion, which expires on December 8, 2025. At September 25, 2022, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nWe expect to issue new debt in the future. The amount and timing of any such new debt will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to maturities of our existing debt, acquisitions and strategic investments, favorable and/or acceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law. Additional information regarding our outstanding debt at September 25, 2022 is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. Debt.'\n\nIncome Taxes. At September 25, 2022, we estimated remaining future payments of $1.7 billion for a one-time U.S. repatriation tax accrued in fiscal 2018, after application of certain tax credits, which is payable in installments over the next four years. At September 25, 2022, other current liabilities included $207 million for the next installment due in January 2023. Beginning in fiscal 2023, we are required to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures for federal income tax purposes. If this requirement is not delayed or repealed, our cash flow generated from operations will be adversely affected due to significantly higher cash tax payments in the near term. Additional information regarding our income taxes is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3. Income Taxes.'",

TXN shows FDII reduced its effective tax rate by 6.1% in 2024, up from 6.8% in 2023, indicating a relatively stable and high utilization of FDII benefits.

      "answer": "In 2024, Broadcom (AVGO) emphasized R&D as a core function, detailing that R&D expenses primarily cover personnel costs for engineers, project materials, and third-party consulting fees, reflecting a focus on internal product development and engineering tools. Cisco (CSCO) reported a 6% year-over-year increase in R&D spending, reaching $7.983 billion, which represents 14.8% of its total revenue, indicating a growing commitment to innovation in its networking and infrastructure solutions. Microsoft (MSFT) allocated $29.51 billion to R&D in 2024, a significant increase from prior years, showing its strong investment in cloud services, AI, and enterprise software innovation. The comparative analysis reveals that while all three companies prioritize R&D, they differ in scale and strategic emphasis\u2014Microsoft leads in absolute investment, Cisco is increasing its proportional focus, and Broadcom emphasizes integration and engineering efficiency.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. Our private cloud infrastructure suite of solutions are available directly from Broadcom, resellers and distributors, hyperscale cloud providers, value-added OEMs and VMware cloud service provider partners. VMware Cloud Foundation ('VCF') provides license portability, which enables customers to purchase subscriptions of VCF software and move their VCF environments between on-premises data centers and supported cloud endpoints. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe, VMware, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stockbased compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, and i nventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence.\n\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\n\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.\n\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\n\nSelling , general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs, which include direct transaction costs and integration costs, and other corporate expenses.\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D'), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with our acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&amp;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nRestructuring and other charges. Restructuring and other charges consist primarily of non-recurring charges related to compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, IP litigation, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalization of product development program costs, facility and l ease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&amp;D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt i s s uance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.\n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains and losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nProvision for income taxes. We benefit from the tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax i ncentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax i ncentives are scheduled",

New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.\n\nInformation regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice.

These forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including 'believes,' 'expects,' 'may,' 'will,' 'should,' 'seeks,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'pro forma,' 'estimates,' 'anticipates,' or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: possible impact of future accounting rules on  AMD's  consolidated  financial  statements;  demand  for  AMD's  products;  the  growth,  change  and  competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future; that AMD's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, together with the  availability  under  that  certain  revolving  credit  facility  (the  Revolving  Credit  Facility)  made  available  to AMD  and certain  of  its  subsidiaries  under  the  Credit Agreement,  and  our  cash  flows  from  operations  will  be  sufficient  to  fund AMD's operations including capital expenditures and purchase commitments over the next 12 months; AMD's ability to obtain  sufficient  external  financing  on  favorable  terms,  or  at  all;  AMD's  expectation  that  based  on  the  information presently  known  to  management,  the  potential  liability  related  to  AMD's  current  litigation  will  not  have  a  material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations; anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls; all unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months; revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied which  will  be  recognized  over  the  next  12  months;  a  small  number  of  customers  will  continue  to  account  for  a substantial part of AMD's revenue in the future; and the acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. For a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements, see 'Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors' and the 'Financial Condition' section set forth in 'Part II, Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' or MD&amp;A, and such other risks and uncertainties as set forth below in this report or detailed in our other Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports and filings.

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. The majority of our customer software contracts include termination for convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are not considered committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usagebased royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions segment contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of October 30, 2022 were approximately $23.6 billion. We expect approximately 28% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Although the majority of our software contracts are not deemed to be committed, our customers generally do not exercise their termination for convenience rights. In addition, the majority of our contracts for products, subscriptions and services have a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods.\n\n## 4. Acquisitions\n\n## Pending Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 'VMware Merger Agreement') to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger') that values VMware at approximately $61 billion based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash.\n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger.\n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware RSU awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.\n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors.\n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion.\n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $1.5 billion.",

Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company's assets and liabilities. T o protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\n\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk ('VAR') model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a M onte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively . Changes in the Company's underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company's foreign currency derivatives.",

These costs could adversely impact our margins as we continue to make significant investments in AI development, add AI capabilities to our  offerings  and  scale  our AI  offerings  without  assurance  that  our  customers  and  users  will  adopt  them.  Further,  as  with  any  new  offerings  based  on  new technologies, consumer reception and monetization pathways are uncertain, our strategies may not be successful and our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. New AI offerings and technologies could modify workforce needs, result in negative publicity about AI and decrease demand for our existing products, services and solutions, all of which could adversely impact our business.\n\n## We participate in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could suffer.\n\nThe markets for our products, services and solutions are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Our numerous competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant sales and research and development resources, broad brand awareness, long operating histories or access to large customer bases to small companies whose specialized focuses may allow them to more easily and effectively deploy technical, marketing and financial resources. Our competitors may develop or acquire products, services or solutions that are similar to ours or that achieve greater or faster acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. As a result, current and potential customers may select the products, services or solutions of our competitors. Further, our future success depends on our continued ability to effectively appeal to businesses and consumers. New industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to entry, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity, global market conditions and the frequent entry of new products or competitors may increase downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and adversely affect our renewal, upsell and cross-sell rates as well as our ability to attract new customers. In addition, we ex pect to face more competition as AI continues to advance and be integrated into the markets in which we compete. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their offerings more successfully and efficiently than we do and achieve greater and faster adoption, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our business and financial results. Other companies have, or in the future may obtain, proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our AI offerings. Further, we ex pect AI offerings to be highly competitive and rapidly evolving. For example, we face increasing competition from companies offering generative AI capabilities, including tex t-to-image, tex t-to-video and multi-modal offerings that compete directly with our creative offerings. If we are not able to  provide  products,  services  and  solutions  that  compete  effectively,  we  could  ex perience  reduced  sales  and  our  business  could  be  adversely  affected. For additional  information  regarding  our  competition  and  the  risks  arising  out  of  the  competitive  environment  in  which  we  operate,  see  the  section  titled 'Competition' contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\n\n## If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe our reputation and brands have been, and we expect them to continue to be, important to our business and financial results. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, reputational harm from, among other things, the introduction of new products, features, services, or terms that do not meet customer expectations; our position  on  or  approach  to  new  and  evolving  technologies,  including  AI;  backlash  from  customers,  the  creative  community,  government  entities  or  other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy, ethical or political positions; significant litigation or regulatory actions that negatively reflect on our business practices; data security breaches or compliance failures; and public scrutiny or negative publicity, including being the target of media and social media campaigns, criticizing our actual or perceived actions or inactions, policies, terms, agreements, handling of user privacy, data practices or content. Further, our brands may be negatively affected by uses of our products, services or solutions, particularly our AI offerings, in ways that are out of our control, such as to create or disseminate content that is deemed to be misleading, deceptive or intended to manipulate public opinion, or for illicit, objectionable or illegal ends, or by our failure to respond appropriately and in a timely manner to such uses. Such uses may result in controversy or claims related to defamation, rights of publicity, illegal content, intellectual property infringement, harmful content, misinformation and disinformation, harmful bias, misappropriation, data privacy, derivative uses of third-party AI and personal injury torts. If we fail to appropriately respond to objectionable content created using our products, services or solutions or shared on our platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands. Entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries in which we operate may also impact our ability to protect our brands. If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our users' trust in us and purchasing decisions and our business and financial results may be adversely affected.",

Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we hav e design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. In 2024, we generated $15.64 billion of rev enue.\n\nFor decades, we hav e operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from v acuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each generation has become more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors are used by a growing number of customers and markets. Our passion continues to be aliv e today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications.\n\nFor many years, we hav e run our business with three ov erarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ev er changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. Our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable and env ironmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achiev ing these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.\n\nAs engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innov ate to create a better world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objectiv e and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term.\n\nOur strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\nThe first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitiv e advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made ov er the years and that continue today. The four sustainable competitiv e adv antages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and div ersity and longev ity of our products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitiv e advantages prov ide tangible benefits, are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitiv e adv antages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our inv estments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and lev eraging of these adv antages.\n\nThe second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, dev elop new capabilities, inv est in manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Ov er a 10-year period from 2015 to 2024, we allocated $101 billion, which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation ov er this period was to driv e organic growth, which includes inv estments in R&amp;D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inv entory. In this period, we allocated about $20 billion to capital expenditures. Our increased capital expenditures are to support future rev enue growth, which will be a greater component of free cash flow per share growth going forward. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to div idends and share repurchases. Div idends are designed to appeal to a broad set of inv estors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretiv e capture of future free cash flow for long-term inv estors. Lastly, for inorganic growth, we allocate to acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectiv es.\n\nThe third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striv ing for more output for ev ery dollar spent. This is about getting our inv estments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; it is not just about optimizing cost cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improv ement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to rev enue growth, improv ed gross margins, disciplined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth.",

      "answer": "AMD discloses specific contributions made to its 401(k) retirement plan, indicating a matching policy of 75% of employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation, with contributions of $70 million in 2023. AVGO provides detailed insight into the actuarial assumptions used in managing its defined benefit pension plans, including the use of discount rates and expected returns on plan assets, reflecting a liability-driven investment strategy. TXN outlines its expected future contributions, forecasting $10 million to be contributed to retirement benefit plans in 2024, indicating a forward-looking funding strategy. Together, these perspectives reveal varying degrees of emphasis on employee benefits, with AMD focusing on immediate matching contributions, AVGO on long-term liability alignment through actuarial precision, and TXN on predictable future funding commitments.",

Oracle demonstrated stronger growth, with EMEA revenue rising to $12,109 million in FY2023 from $12,011 million in FY2022, reflecting a modest but positive trajectory.

We  use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.\n\nWe  expect  to  continue  our  investing  activities,  including  short-term  and  long-term  investments,  purchases  of  computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities expansion. As of December 3, 2021, we expect our capital investment to be approximately $180 million to $220 million, primarily to fund our San Jose and Bangalore construction projects during fiscal 2022. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.\n\n## Revolving Credit Agreement\n\nWe have  a  $1  billion  senior  unsecured  revolving  credit  agreement  ('Revolving  Credit Agreement')  with  a  syndicate  of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through October 17, 2023. As of December 3, 2021, there were no outstanding  borrowings  under  this  credit  agreement  and  the  entire  $1  billion  credit  line  remains  available  for  borrowing.  Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of December 3, 2021, we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Senior Notes\n\nWe  have  $4.15  billion  senior  notes  outstanding,  which  rank  equally  with  our  other  unsecured  and  unsubordinated indebtedness. As of December 3, 2021, the carrying value of our senior notes was $4.12 billion and our maximum commitment for interest payments was $514 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears  on  February  1  and  August  1.  Our  senior  notes  do  not  contain  any  financial  covenants. See  Note  17  of  our  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our debt.\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nOur  purchase  obligations  consist  of  agreements  to  purchase  goods  and  services  entered  into  in  the  ordinary  course  of business. As of December 3, 2021, the value of our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations was $1.38 billion. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our purchase obligations.\n\nWe lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. As of December 3, 2021, the value of our obligations under operating leases was $604 million. See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our lease obligations.\n\nOur transition tax liability related to historical undistributed foreign earnings, which was accrued as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, was approximately $349 million as of December 3, 2021 and is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. As we repatriate foreign earnings for use in the United States, the distributions will generally be exempt from federal income taxes under current U.S. tax law.\n\n## Stock Repurchase Program\n\nTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase our shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $8 billion in our common stock, which we fully utilized during fiscal 2021. In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted additional authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in our common stock through the end of fiscal 2024.\n\nDuring  fiscal  2021,  2020  and  2019,  we  entered  into  several  structured  stock  repurchase  agreements  with  large  financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $3.95 billion, $3.05 billion and $2.75 billion, respectively. We repurchased  approximately  7.2  million  shares  at  an  average  price  of  $536.17  per  share  in  fiscal  2021,  8.0  million  shares  at  an average price of $376.38 per share in fiscal 2020, and 9.9 million shares at an average price of $270.23 per share in fiscal 2019.\n\nSubsequent to December 3, 2021, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase authority, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $2.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares, which represents approximately 75% of our prepayment.

          "chunk_text": "## Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.\n\nMuch of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able  to  continue  to  attract,  train  and  retain  our  leadership  team  and  our  qualified  employees  necessary  for  our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation  otherwise  ceases  to  be  viewed  as  a  valuable  benefit,  our  ability  to  attract,  retain  and  motivate  our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also, if the value of our stock  awards  increases  substantially,  this  could  potentially  create  great  personal  wealth  for  our  executives  and employees  and  affect  our  ability  to  retain  our  personnel.  In  addition,  any  future  restructuring  plans  may  adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.\n\n## Our stock price is subject to volatility.\n\nOur stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities  analysts,  changes  in  our  capital  structure,  including  issuance  of  additional  debt  or  equity  to  the  public, interest  rate  changes,  inflation,  news  regarding  our  products  or  products  of  our  competitors,  and  broad  market  and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities.\n\nIn May 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program to purchase up to $4  billion  of  our  outstanding  common  stock  in  the  open  market.  This  repurchase  program  does  not  obligate  us  to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Our stock repurchases could affect the trading price of our stock, the volatility of our stock price, reduce our cash reserves, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stock price.\n\n## Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products.\n\nWorldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively  affect  our  operations,  or  adversely  affect  demand  for  our  products,  and  such  attacks  or  related  armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets.\n\n## ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, we leased approximately 2.7 million square feet of space for research and development, engineering,  administrative  and  warehouse  use  throughout  the  world.  Our  headquarters  is  located  in  Santa  Clara, California,  and  we  have  significant  operations  in  Austin,  Texas;  Shanghai,  China;  Markham,  Ontario,  Canada;  and Bangalore and Hyderabad, India. We also have a number of regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America.\n\nWe currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to  expiration  or  through  month-to-month  occupancy  or  replacing  them  with  equivalent  facilities.  We  believe  that  our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize such capacity.",

      "question": "How do Adobe, Cisco, and Oracle compare in terms of their EMEA revenue growth rates in 2024, and what does this reveal about their relative performance and positioning in the European market?",
      "answer": "Adobe reported a 14% growth in EMEA revenue, from $4.881 billion in 2023 to $5.554 billion in 2024. Cisco's EMEA revenue grew from $9.118 billion to $14.283 billion, representing a 56.6% growth in 2024, significantly influenced by the Splunk acquisition. Oracle's EMEA revenue increased from $12.109 billion in 2023 to $13.030 billion in 2024, a 7.6% growth rate. This indicates that Cisco experienced the highest EMEA growth, largely due to acquisition-driven expansion, while Oracle had the lowest growth rate, suggesting more stable but slower market expansion in the region compared to its peers.",

      "answer": "Adobe includes debt repayment as part of its customary uses of cash, alongside stock repurchases and acquisitions, indicating a balanced capital allocation approach. Cisco repaid $1.8 billion in debt during fiscal 2024, a use of cash that was partially offset by new debt issuance, showing a strategic but measured approach to managing its balance sheet amid large acquisitions. NVIDIA, facing a $1.3 billion debt repayment in fiscal 2025, emphasized its $26.0 billion in liquidity to meet obligations while continuing to invest in capital expenditures and shareholder returns. Together, these approaches reveal varying degrees of liquidity conservatism and strategic debt management among three major tech firms navigating similar macroeconomic conditions.",

      "answer": "AVGO's 2023 cost of revenue was $19,065 million on total revenue of $51,574 million, representing a cost of revenue percentage of approximately 37%. NVDA's cost of revenue was $141 million on total revenue of $3,549 million, equating to a much lower percentage of about 4%. TXN's cost of revenue was $6,500 million on total revenue of $17,519 million, representing a cost of revenue percentage of approximately 37%. This comparison reveals that NVDA maintains significantly tighter control over its cost of revenue relative to revenue size, while AVGO and TXN exhibit similar cost structures, suggesting differences in business models and cost management strategies.",

      "answer": "ADbe accounts for rebates as variable consideration, estimating and recording reserves for these programs on a portfolio basis at contract inception and assessing them for reasonableness each reporting period. AMD presents rebates as a reduction from accounts receivable, managing exposure through credit evaluations and ongoing monitoring procedures. Avgo accrues 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale and reverses the accrual when rebate programs end or when unclaimed rebates are no longer expected to be paid. These differences suggest that ADBE focuses on forward-looking estimation and portfolio-level adjustments, AMD emphasizes credit risk control and conservative receivables management, and AVGO takes a strict accrual-based approach to ensure revenue accuracy and rebate liability transparency.",

We have concluded that the onpremise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document  Cloud  customers,  which  is  to  provide  a  complete  end-to-end  creative  design  or  document  workflow  solution  that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.\n\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared  reviews  which  enable  simultaneous  editing  and  commenting  of  PDFs  across  desktop,  mobile  and  web;  automatic  cloud rendering  of  a  design  which  enables  it  to  be  worked  on  in  multiple  mediums;  and  Sensei,  Adobe's  cloud-hosted  artificial intelligence  and  machine  learning  framework,  which  enables  features  such  as  automated  photo-editing,  photograph  contentawareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.\n\nStandalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable inputs, primarily actual historical selling prices  for  performance  obligations  where  available,  and  includes  consideration  of  factors  such  as  go-to-market  model  and geography. Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they are sold and what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g., the performance obligation  is  not  sold  separately),  we  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  by  using  information  that  may  include  reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.\n\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5 years. We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, including contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products. When the expected period of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we expense the amount as incurred, utilizing the practical expedient. We regularly evaluate whether there have been changes in the underlying assumptions and data used to determine the amortization period.\n\nWhen  revenue  arrangements  include  components  of  third-party  goods  and  services,  for  example  in  transactions  which involve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report  revenues  on  a  gross  basis,  or  an  agent,  and  report  revenues  on  a  net  basis.  In  this  assessment,  we  consider  if  we  obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer by evaluating indicators such as which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, which party has discretion in establishing price and the underlying terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction.\n\nWe offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors,  resellers  and/or  end-user  customers.  We  estimate  and  record  reserves  for  these  programs  as  variable  consideration when estimating transaction price. Returns, rebates and other offsets to transaction price are estimated at contract inception on a portfolio basis and assessed for reasonableness each reporting period when additional information becomes available.\n\n## General Contract Provisions\n\nWe maintain  revenue  reserves  for  rebates,  rights  of  return  and  other  limited  price  adjustments.  Distributors  are  allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and for products that are being replaced by new versions. We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. Transaction price is reduced for these amounts based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period, such as volume and timely reporting.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. The primary method of establishing these reserves is to review historical data from prior periods as a",

Qualitative  factors  include  industry  and  market  considerations,  overall  financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present  value  of  expected  future  cash  flows  to  determine  a  reporting  unit's  fair  value.  Significant  estimates  include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions.\n\nA goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nFrom time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and  federal  government  clean-up  activities  at  or  near  locations  where  the  Company  currently  or  has  in  the  past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nCash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Other investments in time deposits due within 12 months and marketable securities  are  included  in  short-term  investments.  Classification  of  marketable  securities  as  current  is  based  on  the Company's intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months.\n\n## Accounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivable  are  primarily  comprised  of  trade  receivables  presented  net  of  rebates,  price  protection  and  an allowance  for  credit  loss.  Accounts  receivable  also  include  unbilled  receivables,  which  primarily  represent  work completed  on  development  services  recognized  as  revenue  but  not  yet  invoiced  to  customers  and  semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months.\n\nThe  Company  manages  its  exposure  to  customer  credit  risk  through  credit  limits,  credit  lines,  ongoing  monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and,  at  intervals,  for  existing  customers.  From  this,  the  Company  may  require  letters  of  credit,  bank  or  corporate guarantees  or  advance  payments  if  deemed  necessary.  The  Company  maintains  an  allowance  for  credit  loss, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt issuance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.\n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains or losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nProvision for income taxes. We have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax incentives are presently expected to expire in November 2025. The corporate income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in 2028.\n\nEach tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with any such operating conditions specified, we could, in some instances, be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits, or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying, we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled. We may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. Before taking into consideration the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other indirect tax impacts, the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to decrease the provision for income taxes by approximately $1,821 million and $1,156 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nOur interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded, we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm's length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP') requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets, and income taxes. See Note 2. 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates.\n\nRevenue recognition. We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party's rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer. Our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services.\n\nWe recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer. An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates. Different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results. We also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. Thus, the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods.",

      "question": "How do ADBE, AVGO, and NVDA each address the impact of employee turnover on their business strategies, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to workforce management and operational risk?",
      "answer": "ADBE highlights that employee turnover could disrupt ongoing business and distract management, especially during acquisitions, which may prevent the company from realizing anticipated benefits. AVGO notes that employee-related claims and legal proceedings can divert management attention and result in significant expenses, indirectly reflecting the importance of retaining key personnel. NVDA explicitly discloses its low overall turnover rate of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024 and emphasizes a structured approach to recruitment, development, and retention, indicating a strong focus on workforce stability. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies recognize employee turnover as a risk, NVDA proactively manages it through strategic HR initiatives, whereas ADBE and AVGO focus more on the indirect operational and legal risks associated with workforce instability.",

Cisco accrues warranty costs as part of cost of sales and offers warranties ranging from 90 days to five years, with some limited lifetime warranties. NVIDIA highlights that product defects can lead to significant warranty and recall costs, and specifically notes a defect in a third-party component in fiscal 2023 that led to a net warranty liability.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\n## Defects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage our reputation and cause us to lose market share.\n\nOur hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. They have in the past and may in the future contain defects, security vulnerabilities, experience failures, or unsatisfactory performance due to issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may also increase when our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, or new versions are released, and when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. AI software products that we or our partners offer rely on training data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain unknown or undetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. A lthough arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used.\n\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property , or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEM s, ODM s, A IB manufacturers, automotive manufacturers, and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. A ny such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty , support, and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory , and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. A n error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers' perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\n\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party , such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to Our G lobal Operating Business\n\n## Adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\n\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary , or trade policy , disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, including the implementation of tariffs by the USG or other governments, have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:\n\n- increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;\n- increased supply , employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;\n- decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\n- the inability  of our suppliers to deliv er on their supply  commitments to us and our customers' or our licensees' inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\n- limits on our ability  to forecast operating results and make business decisions;",

      "answer": "Apple repurchased $499.372 billion of common stock in 2024, reflecting a consistent but slightly increasing buyback activity over the years. Salesforce repurchased $7,815 million of common stock in 2024, showing a steady continuation of its buyback program. In contrast, Microsoft repurchased $17,254 million of common stock in 2024, indicating a significant reduction compared to prior years.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Customers and Markets\n\nMany  factors  influence  the  IT,  collaboration,  and  networking  requirements  of  our  customers.  These  include  the  size  of  the organization,  number  and  types  of  technology  systems,  geographic  location,  and  business  applications  deployed  throughout  the customer's  network.  Our  customer  base  is  not  limited  to  any  specific  industry,  geography,  or  market  segment.  Our  customers primarily operate in the following markets: enterprise, commercial, service provider, and public sector.\n\n## Enterprise\n\nEnterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multivendor environment. We offer service and support packages,  financing,  and  managed  network  services,  primarily  through  our  service  provider  partners.  We  sell  these  products through  a  network  of  third-party  application  and  technology  vendors  and  channel  partners,  as  well  as  selling  directly  to  these customers.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe  commercial  market  represents  larger,  or  midmarket  and  small  businesses.  We  sell  to  our  midmarket  customers  through  a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with less complexity. Small businesses require information technologies and communications products  that  are  easy  to  configure,  install,  and  maintain.  We  sell  to  these  smaller  organizations  within  the  commercial  market primarily through channel partners.\n\n## Service Providers\n\nService  providers  offer  data,  voice,  video,  and  mobile/wireless  services  to  businesses,  governments,  utilities,  and  consumers worldwide. The service provider market includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers, webscale operators as well as  Internet,  cable,  and  wireless  providers.  We  also  include  media,  broadcast,  and  content  providers  within  our  service  provider market,  as  the  lines  in  the  telecommunications  industry  continue  to  blur  between  traditional  network-based,  content-based  and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or Internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach.\n\n## Public Sector\n\nThe public sector market includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers. Many public sector customers have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector customers through a network of third-party application and technology vendors, channel partners, as well as through direct sales.\n\n## Sales Overview\n\nAs of the end of fiscal 2022, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 26,000 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Channel  partners  include  systems  integrators,  service  providers,  other resellers, and distributors.\n\nSystems  integrators  and  service  providers  typically  sell  directly  to  end  users  and  often  provide  system  installation,  technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators.\n\nDistributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-in method. These distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.\n\nFor  information  regarding  risks  related  to  our  sales  channels,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  including  the  risk  factors  entitled 'Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins' and 'Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.'\n\nFor  information  regarding  risks  relating  to  our  international  operations,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  including  the  risk  factors entitled 'Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain",

We generally do not hav e long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inv entory lev els in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates prov ided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. T o the extent we fail  to  forecast  demand  and  product  mix  accurately  or  are  unable  to  increase  production  or  secure  sufficient  capacity  and  there  is  a  mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and hav e a material adv erse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inv entory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, our Embedded segment rev enue decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize their inv entory lev els. We may build inv entories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or ov erproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inv entory, which could result in write-downs of inv entory and an adv erse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiv ing certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products.\n\nExcess or obsolete inv entory hav e resulted in, and may in the future result in, write-downs of the v alue of our inv entory. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inv entory, a reduction in the av erage selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inv entory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressiv e pricing actions.",

      "answer": "ADBE highlights that significant investments in AI development and uncertainty around customer adoption of new AI offerings could adversely impact their margins. INTC notes that manufacturing delays, particularly with next-generation process nodes like Intel 7, have led to asset write-downs (e.g., in Q3 2024) and higher production costs, which pressure gross margins. NVDA points to mismatches between supply and demand\u2014amplified by long lead times and non-cancellable purchase orders\u2014as a key risk, with inventory write-downs and cancellation penalties negatively affecting gross margins. Together, these perspectives reveal that while ADBE faces margin risks from uncertain returns on AI innovation, INTC is grappling with internal manufacturing inefficiencies, and NVDA is contending with external supply chain volatility and demand unpredictability.",

These costs could adversely impact our margins as we continue to make significant investments in AI development, add AI capabilities to our  offerings  and  scale  our AI  offerings  without  assurance  that  our  customers  and  users  will  adopt  them.  Further,  as  with  any  new  offerings  based  on  new technologies, consumer reception and monetization pathways are uncertain, our strategies may not be successful and our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. New AI offerings and technologies could modify workforce needs, result in negative publicity about AI and decrease demand for our existing products, services and solutions, all of which could adversely impact our business.\n\n## We participate in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could suffer.\n\nThe markets for our products, services and solutions are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Our numerous competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant sales and research and development resources, broad brand awareness, long operating histories or access to large customer bases to small companies whose specialized focuses may allow them to more easily and effectively deploy technical, marketing and financial resources. Our competitors may develop or acquire products, services or solutions that are similar to ours or that achieve greater or faster acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. As a result, current and potential customers may select the products, services or solutions of our competitors. Further, our future success depends on our continued ability to effectively appeal to businesses and consumers. New industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to entry, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity, global market conditions and the frequent entry of new products or competitors may increase downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and adversely affect our renewal, upsell and cross-sell rates as well as our ability to attract new customers. In addition, we ex pect to face more competition as AI continues to advance and be integrated into the markets in which we compete. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their offerings more successfully and efficiently than we do and achieve greater and faster adoption, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our business and financial results. Other companies have, or in the future may obtain, proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our AI offerings. Further, we ex pect AI offerings to be highly competitive and rapidly evolving. For example, we face increasing competition from companies offering generative AI capabilities, including tex t-to-image, tex t-to-video and multi-modal offerings that compete directly with our creative offerings. If we are not able to  provide  products,  services  and  solutions  that  compete  effectively,  we  could  ex perience  reduced  sales  and  our  business  could  be  adversely  affected. For additional  information  regarding  our  competition  and  the  risks  arising  out  of  the  competitive  environment  in  which  we  operate,  see  the  section  titled 'Competition' contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\n\n## If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe our reputation and brands have been, and we expect them to continue to be, important to our business and financial results. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, reputational harm from, among other things, the introduction of new products, features, services, or terms that do not meet customer expectations; our position  on  or  approach  to  new  and  evolving  technologies,  including  AI;  backlash  from  customers,  the  creative  community,  government  entities  or  other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy, ethical or political positions; significant litigation or regulatory actions that negatively reflect on our business practices; data security breaches or compliance failures; and public scrutiny or negative publicity, including being the target of media and social media campaigns, criticizing our actual or perceived actions or inactions, policies, terms, agreements, handling of user privacy, data practices or content. Further, our brands may be negatively affected by uses of our products, services or solutions, particularly our AI offerings, in ways that are out of our control, such as to create or disseminate content that is deemed to be misleading, deceptive or intended to manipulate public opinion, or for illicit, objectionable or illegal ends, or by our failure to respond appropriately and in a timely manner to such uses. Such uses may result in controversy or claims related to defamation, rights of publicity, illegal content, intellectual property infringement, harmful content, misinformation and disinformation, harmful bias, misappropriation, data privacy, derivative uses of third-party AI and personal injury torts. If we fail to appropriately respond to objectionable content created using our products, services or solutions or shared on our platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands. Entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries in which we operate may also impact our ability to protect our brands. If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our users' trust in us and purchasing decisions and our business and financial results may be adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties.\n\nWe are continually engaged in the development of next-generation technologies. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes and other technologies is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially  anticipated.\n\nWe are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our 7nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. In 2022, Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party foundries, such as TSM C, to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. On the product side, we have had limited market success with our accelerator offerings, and in 2024 we recognized $922 million in Gaudi A I accelerator inventory-related charges. We may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of further delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products or lack of market success with our offerings.\n\nOur efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&amp;D investments, particularly as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses, as we were required to do in the third quarter of 2024 with respect to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications). Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs, adversely affect our gross margins, and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A  new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. In addition, the cost of new leading-edge process nodes continues to increase at a higher rate relative to legacy process nodes due to a number of factors, including the cost of procuring and operating advanced manufacturing equipment. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have increased the number of transistors per die, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products.\n\nOur disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability  to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.\n\nFrom time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses; interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions-all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could result in production timing delays. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability  to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation\n\n33",

These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our A I cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\n\n## Risks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\n\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately , has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\n\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the  semiconductor  industry  and/or  limited  supply  or  capacity  in  our  supply  chain,  the  lead  times  for  certain  supply   may   be  ex tended.  W e  hav e  prev iously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. T o secure future supply and capacity , we have paid premiums, provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs.\n\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory , significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and contract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply , we may not be able to meet increased customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share. A dditionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties.\n\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly . We have had to reduce average selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers' increase in prices, write down our inventory , incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may have to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. A ll of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\n\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, include:\n\n- changes in product development cycles and time to market;\n- competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\n- changes in business and economic conditions;\n- sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\n- rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n- the availability  of sufficient data center capacity  or energy  for customers to procure;\n- new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n- new or unexpected end-use cases;\n- increase in demand for competitive products;\n- changes in end-user demand;",

MSFT had the highest absolute expense at $7,609 million, but it represented a smaller proportion of total revenue (3.1%) due to its significantly larger revenue base.

Pursuant to ASC 606, revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps:\n\n- i dentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n- i dentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- determination of the transaction price;\n- allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and\n- recognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nOur customers that contract with us for the provision of cloud services, software, hardware or other services include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices for cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud SaaS and cloud infrastructure contracts are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance. Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating expenses, net within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.\n\nOur revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant. Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services\n\nRevenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the cloud services are delivered, beginning on the date our service is made available to a customer. We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period. Revenues from cloud services that are provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\n\nCybersecurity, Privacy, and AI Considerations Could Impact the Company's Business: There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of individual and groups of criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored organizations, nation states and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts or omissions of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or technologies, as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. Computer hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and networks, like those we offer, using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure, and the increased use of generative AI may introduce novel methods of attack. Attacks also include social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products, services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations. Cyber threats are increasing in number and sophistication, continually evolving, including with the increased use of AI, making it difficult to anticipate and defend against such threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time.\n\nThe company's products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors.\n\nAs is common in our industry and for a company our size, we continue to face and prepare for cybersecurity threats. While the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate a wide range of cybersecurity events, there have not been cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse effect in the future.\n\nThe company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents, including industry-wide incidents such as MOVEit, have or could result in, for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third-party data or systems; theft or import or export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, including key innovations in AI, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service.\n\nIn the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including debarment, as well as the loss of ex isting or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, damage to our competitive position, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the company's industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and ex ploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, including in our own products, services, systems and networks, or third-party data and systems upon which we rely, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complex ity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers.\n\nCybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, the open source community and other third parties, including, for example, providing and implementing patches to address vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third-party operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation.",

We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners' supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. We have incorporated thirdparty data into some of our A I models and used open-source datasets to train our models and may continue to do so. These datasets may be flawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may otherwise decrease resilience to security incidents that may compromise the integrity of our A I outputs, leading to potential reputational damage, regulatory scrutiny , or adverse impacts on the performance and reliability of our products, which could, in turn, affect our partners' operations, customer trust, and our revenue. We may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our A I algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties' information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party  suppliers suffers a security  incident (which has happened in the past and may happen in the future), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security incident. A dditionally , we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business.\n\nTo defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident.\n\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties, could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability , regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For example, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to the risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA  to potential litigation and liability . If we or a third party we rely on experience  a  security  incident,  which  has  occurred  in  the  past,  or  are  perceived  to  have  experienced  a  security  incident,  we  may  experience  adverse consequences,  including  government  enforcement  actions,  additional  reporting  requirements  and/or  oversight,  restrictions  on  processing  data,  litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, diversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. W e are required by certain  data  priv acy   and  security   obligations  to  notify   relev ant  stakeholders,  including  affected  indiv iduals,  customers,  regulators  and  inv estors,  of  security incidents, and mandatory disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity . In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect or infer sensitiv e information about us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to harm our business.\n\n## Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\n\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause disruptions to our worldwide operations include: natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, critical infrastructure failures, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory changes, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity , and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in A sia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors  who  provide  us  critical  infrastructure  services  for  IT  and  research  and  development  systems  and  personnel.  Geopolitical  and  domestic  political developments and other events beyond our control can increase economic volatility globally . Political instability , changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and T aiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product",

      "answer": "AVGO defines its purchase commitments as unconditional obligations to purchase goods or services, primarily inventory, with enforceable terms, and excludes short-term or cancelable agreements. CSCO highlights the risks associated with binding purchase commitments, particularly how they may obligate the company to buy components at prices higher than current market rates, potentially reducing gross margins. MSFT quantifies its purchase commitments at $72,022 million in total, with $68,280 million due in 2025 and $3,742 million thereafter, indicating a near-term financial obligation tied to procurement agreements. Together, these perspectives show AVGO focusing on definitional clarity, CSCO emphasizing risk exposure, and MSFT disclosing the scale and timing of commitments, offering a comprehensive view of how different tech companies manage procurement obligations.",

      "answer": "Apple recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Accenture recognizes share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period for awards based on the grant date fair value, with estimated forfeitures revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs. Intel uses the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures, and applies a first-in, first-out approach when vesting or forfeiture occurs for RSUs with multiple vesting dates. While all three companies recognize share-based compensation over the service period, Apple and Intel emphasize straight-line amortization with forfeiture adjustments, whereas Accenture places more emphasis on dynamic forfeiture estimation and revision. This suggests that Apple and Intel have more stable, long-term oriented equity compensation models, while Accenture maintains a more adaptive approach based on observed employee behavior.",

          "chunk_text": "For some managed services contracts, we receive payments for transition or set-up activities, which are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are provided. These advance payments are typically not a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to complete its obligations under the contract. We elected the practical expedient to report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.\n\n## Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements\n\nShare-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs from previous estimates.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. A  valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We establish liabilities or reduce assets when we believe tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Each fiscal quarter, we evaluate tax positions and adjust the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. We release stranded tax effects from A ccumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items.\n\n## Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts\n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments are included in A ccumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including certificates of deposit and time deposits.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses-Client Receivables and Contract Assets\n\nWe record client receivables and contract assets at their face amounts less an allowance for credit losses. The allowance represents our estimate of expected credit losses based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information. A s of A ugust 31, 2024 and 2023, the total allowances recorded for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $27,561 and $26,343, respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to changes in gross client receivables, contract assets and immaterial write-offs.\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\nOur financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments and client receivables, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.",

          "chunk_text": "## Business Combinations\n\nWe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining the fair value of the following:\n\n- inventory; property, plant, and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; and contingent consideration; each as may be applicable;\n- intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;\n- deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; and\n- goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\n\nOur assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. These assumptions and estimates are used to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may recognize adjustments to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and related goodwill.\n\n## Employee Equity Incentive Plans\n\nWe use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award.\n\nFor the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled.\n\nWe assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, such changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.\n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for (benefit from) taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nWe recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in US taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-US earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis differences. Remittances of non-US earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-US and US operations. M aterial changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-US earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-US income and withholding taxes.\n\n## Leases\n\nLeases consist of real property and machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate when it is reasonably certain that we will ex ercise such options. For leases for supplier capacity, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. For all other leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately and do not include the non-lease components in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Pay ments on leases may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n67",

To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances i nvolved in each particular agreement.\n\nOur Oracle Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreement during the service period. Our license and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the applicable program documentation for a period of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services.\n\n## 11.STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT)\n\n## Common Stock Repurchases\n\nOur Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of May 31, 2024, approximately $7.0 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 10.6 million shares for $1.2 billion, 17.0 million shares for $1.3 billion, and 185.8 million shares for $16.2 billion in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, under the stock repurchase program.\n\nOur stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\n\n## Dividends on Common Stock\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $1.60, $1.36 and $1.28 per share of our outstanding common stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period.\n\nIn June 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 25, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 11, 2024. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.",

MSFT reports long-term accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts at $4.5 billion as of June 30, 2023, suggesting a more significant but managed credit risk. NVDA shows a consistent allowance for doubtful accounts of $4 million throughout fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating stable and minimal expected credit losses.

We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.                                                                                        |\n| Refer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with |\n| As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance.

      "answer": "In 2022, AMD managed revenue reductions through variable consideration adjustments tied to distributor and OEM incentive programs, including price protection, rebates, and product returns, based on historical data and internal/external market analysis. ORCL experienced a $118 million revenue reduction due to its withdrawal from Russia and Belarus amid the Ukraine conflict, highlighting geopolitical exposure. QCOM faced potential revenue reductions due to intellectual property enforcement risks, including challenges in collecting royalties and adverse legal outcomes in licensing disputes. Together, these cases reveal that while AMD\u2019s revenue adjustments are primarily tied to channel incentives and demand forecasting, ORCL\u2019s exposure stems from geopolitical instability, and QCOM\u2019s risks are rooted in IP protection and licensing dynamics.",

Where funds provided for such programs  can  be  estimated,  we  recognize  a  reduction  to  revenue  at  the  time  the  related  revenue  is  recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer's cost to perform specific  product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.\n\nWe also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer's prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights  provided  to  distributor  and  OEM  customers,  we  utilize  relevant,  trended  actual  historical  product  return  rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable.\n\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor  customers,  based  on  our  assumptions  and  include  adjustments,  if  any,  for  known  events,  have  been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management's judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\n\nInventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results.\n\nGoodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.\n\nWe first analyze qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nIf  we  conclude  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  value,  a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present  value  of  expected  future  cash  flows  to  determine  a  reporting  unit's  fair  value.  Significant  estimates  include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions.",

If enacted, these proposals would materially increase the level of income tax on our international profits.\n\nOur future income tax provisions and effective tax rate could materially increase if any of the foregoing potential tax changes are implemented or if other changes are made to applicable tax laws and rules in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of income earned or losses incurred in jurisdictions  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  fluctuations  in  our  stock  price  and  level  of  stock-based  compensation  expense, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and by other factors.\n\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related regulations, competition regulations, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges.  Any  such  violations  could  result  in  prohibitions  on  our  ability  to  offer  our  products  and  services  in  one  or  more countries,  could  delay  or  prevent  potential  acquisitions  and  could  also  materially  damage  our  reputation,  our  brand,  our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. These laws can require  suspension  or  termination  of  business,  including  financial  transactions,  in  certain  countries,  territories  or  with  certain customers and any such action in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example,  in  response  to  the  current  Russia-Ukraine  conflict,  the  U.S.  and  other  countries  have  announced  extensive  sanctions against Russia and could impose broader sanctions or take other actions should the conflict further escalate. Oracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Oracle recorded fiscal 2022 revenues of $248 million from these two countries, a reduction of $118 million relative to fiscal 2021. No revenues are expected to be recognized from these two countries prospectively. Compliance with these laws also requires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management's attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts.\n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate  allegations  of  improprieties  relating  to  transactions  and  the  way  in  which  such  transactions  are  recorded.  Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, and in some circumstances such authorities conduct their own investigations and we respond to their requests or demands for information. No assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective.\n\nWe are  also  subject  to  a  variety  of  other  risks  and  challenges  in  managing  an  organization  operating  globally,  including  those related to:\n\n- general economic conditions in each country or region;\n- political  unrest,  terrorism,  war  and  the  potential  for  other  hostilities,  including  but  not  limited  to,  the  current  RussiaUkraine  conflict,  the  economic  impact  thereof  and  the  potential  to  subject  our  business  to  materially  adverse consequences  should  the  situation  escalate  beyond  its  current  scope,  including,  among  other  potential  impacts,  the geographic proximity of the situation relative to the rest of Europe, where a material portion of our business is carried out;\n- public  health  risks,  social  risks  and  supporting  infrastructure  stability  risks,  particularly  in  areas  in  which  we  have significant operations;",

If any of these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nThe enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.\n\nWe rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our intellectual property, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and intellectual property is difficult and time consuming. The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our products, technologies or intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. See also the Risk Factor titled 'Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.'\n\nSome industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In the United States, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes, and there is current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing business. Further, the laws in certain foreign countries in which our patents are or may be licensed, or our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in ways that are detrimental to our licensing programs or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.\n\nWe have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property and contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio due to, among others: refusal by certain licensees to report and pay all or a portion of the royalties they owe to us; policies or political actions of governments, including trade protection and national security policies; challenges to our licensing practices under competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions; failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and challenges before competition agencies to our licensing business or the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. See also the Risk Factors titled ' Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business ' and ' Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings .'\n\nWe have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation or arbitration, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements or initiating litigation or arbitration), license terms (including but not limited to royalty rates for the use of our intellectual property) could be imposed that are less favorable to us than existing terms, and we could incur substantial costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues and cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development, in the periods prior to conclusion.\n\nAdditionally, although our license agreements generally provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements.\n\nSee also the Risk Factors titled ' Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business ' and 'Our business and",

      "answer": "Accenture (ACN) reports $2,370,000 in aggregate potential liability for guarantees involving third-party performance as of August 31, 2024, with $1,758,783 in issued guarantees (net of recourse provisions), indicating a focus on contractual risk transfer. Cisco (CSCO) shows a warranty provision balance of $362 million at the end of fiscal 2024, with $425 million in new provisions during the year, reflecting ongoing product-related warranty obligations. Oracle (ORCL) states that it has not accrued any material liabilities related to warranties or indemnifications due to a limited history of claims, suggesting a more conservative or historically low-risk exposure.

Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Indemnifications and Guarantees\n\nIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. These arrangements with clients can include provisions whereby we have joint and several liability in relation to the performance of certain contractual obligations along with third parties also providing services and products for a specific project. In addition, our consulting arrangements may include warranty provisions that our solutions will substantially operate in accordance with the applicable system requirements. Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold the indemnified party harmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or certain intellectual property rights.\n\nTypically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments we made in connection with arrangements where third-party nonperformance has given rise to the client's claim. Payments we made under any of the arrangements described above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim, which may be disputed by us typically under dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be expressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.\n\nAs of A ugust 31, 2024 and 2023, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $2,370,000 and $1,793,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $61,000 and $51,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.\n\nAs of A ugust 31, 2024 and 2023, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $1,758,783 ($1,609,046 net of recourse provisions) and $1,294,653 ($1,213,375 net of recourse provisions) respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.\n\nTo date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole.\n\n## Legal Contingencies\n\nAs of A ugust 31, 2024, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, except as otherwise noted below, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\n\nOn July 24, 2019, A ccenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of M arriott International, Inc. ('M arriott') in the U.S. District Court for the District of M ary land. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys' fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. ('Starwood'), which was acquired by M arriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On M ay 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, which we appealed. On A ugust 17, 2023, the appeals court vacated the class certification and remanded the case to the district court for consideration of, among other things, the class action waiver signed by Starwood customer plaintiffs. On November 29, 2023, the district court reinstated the classes previously certified by the court in M ay 2022. We are appealing the district court's decision. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. A t present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.",

To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.

Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\n\n## Dividends on Common Stock\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $1.60, $1.36 and $1.28 per share of our outstanding common stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period.\n\nIn June 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of our outstanding common stock.

MSFT disclosed $476 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards, some of which expire between fiscal years 2025 and 2044, while others are indefinite. QCOM had $150 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards, with $102 million expiring between 2025 and 2037 and $48 million indefinite. These differences suggest varying levels of historical profitability and tax planning strategies, with QCOM having the smallest federal NOL position and INTC maintaining a moderate but largely indefinite carryforward base, while MSFT holds the largest NOL with a mix of expiration timelines. This indicates differing degrees of past financial performance and strategic use of tax loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income.",

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Subscription, Product and Services Offerings\n\nWe enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloudhosted  offerings,  term-based,  royalty,  and  perpetual  software  licenses,  associated  software  maintenance  and  support  plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights,  or  options  to  either  renew  monthly  on-premise  term-based  licenses  or  use  committed  funds  to  purchase  other  Adobe products or services.\n\nFully  hosted  subscription  services  (SaaS)  allow  customers  to  access  hosted  software  during  the  contractual  term  without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.\n\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically  accounted  for  utilizing  the  'as-invoiced'  practical  expedient.  Revenue  for  subscriptions  sold  as  a  fee  per  period  is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.\n\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\n\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent  stand-ready  performance  obligations.  Revenue  from  these  subscription  support  plans  is  recognized  ratably  over  their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\n\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all  other  revenue  recognition  criteria  are  met,  and  classified  as  product  revenue  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income. Revenue  from  on-premise  term  license  or  term  licensing  arrangements  with  unilateral  cancellation  rights  or  monthly  renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\n\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.  Our  transaction-based  advertising  offerings,  where  fees  are  based  on  a  number  of  impressions  per  month  and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the 'asinvoiced' practical expedient.\n\n## Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services.

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nindefinite-lived intangible assets are quantitatively assessed for impairment, if necessary, by comparing their estimated fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and longlived assets may be based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, expected selling price and/or other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when appropriate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of such assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values.\n\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated.\n\nRevenue Recognition. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing of our intellectual property. We also generate revenues from licensing system software and by performing development and other services and from other product sales. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our performance obligations.\n\nRevenues from sales of our products are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. Revenues from providing services are typically recognized over time as our performance obligation is satisfied. Revenues from providing services and licensing system software were each less than 5% of total revenues for all periods presented.\n\nWe grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale or use of certain wireless products. Licensees pay royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay a fixed license fee in one or more installments. Sales-based royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). We broadly provide per unit royalty caps that apply to certain categories of complete wireless devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches, and provide for a maximum royalty amount payable per device. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licensee-by-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nLicense agreements that require payment of license fees contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual property that exists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated. Since we expect to expend efforts to develop and transfer updates to our licensed portfolio on an even basis, license fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is executed and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement.

          "chunk_text": "that have been agreed upon, our anticipated cash requirements may increase, our strategy, business and financial results may be adversely affected, and we may be constrained in our ability to engage in transactions that are in the best interests of our stockholders.\n\n## Changes in product demand and margins can adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM  to grow over time, driven by factors such as a larger installed base, demand for A I capabilities, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize, or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products have in the past and may in the future reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.\n\nImportant factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:\n\n- business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;\n- consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n- customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as the shift in data center spend to GPUs to support A I workloads;\n- geopolitical conditions, including trade policies, potential tariffs or other trade restrictions, and geopolitical tensions and conflicts;\n- our ability  to timely  introduce competitiv e products;\n- competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;\n- the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;\n- customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and\n- disruptions affecting customers, such as the delays in obtaining tools, components, and other supplies as a result of COV ID-19-related port shutdowns in China that negatively impacted demand for our business in 2022, as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021.\n\nOur pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our core product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms to higher-end platforms. Our ancillary product offerings that extend beyond our core product lines typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced products, and at times are not profitable. Some of our higher-priced products, however, such as the Intel Core Ultra 200V  processors launched in September 2024, have lower margins as they are produced at external foundries rather than in our manufacturing facilities. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-margin to lower-margin products in any of our market segments, as has been the case with the Intel Core Ultra 200V  processors, our gross margin percentage has decreased and may decrease again.\n\n## Macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including changes to trade policies and regulations, present significant risks to us in many jurisdictions.\n\nWe have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&amp;D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Our operations rely upon a supply chain that is also highly distributed, and with reliance in some instances on supplies or materials available in only one or more geographic areas. M oreover, sales outside the US accounted for 76% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, with revenue from billings to China contributing 29% of our total revenue. A s a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to execute our business strategy, manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.\n\nAdverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth; changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy; high interest rates; tighter credit; inflation; lower capital ex penditures by  businesses, including on IT infrastructure; increases in unemployment; and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. A n economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to: increased credit and collectability risks; higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets; reduced liquidity; adverse impacts on our suppliers; failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers; asset impairments; and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\n\nTrade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. They can also result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term",

      "answer": "Apple highlights that it records write-downs for obsolete or excess inventory and accrues cancellation fees for excess component orders, noting that it builds inventory up to 150 days in advance of product shipments, which increases exposure to forecast inaccuracies. AMD mentions that prepayment arrangements with vendors expose it to risks of excess inventory if customer demand decreases, and that sole or limited suppliers for critical materials increase the likelihood of supply imbalances. Cisco Systems states that increased inventory and purchase commitments made to counter supply constraints could lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charges if demand falls short of expectations, especially following the component shortages seen in fiscal 2022. Together, these perspectives show that all three companies face significant exposure to inventory risk due to procurement volatility, though each manages and reports the risk through different operational lenses\u2014Apple through write-downs and forecast cycles, AMD through supplier concentration and prepayment exposure, and Cisco through inventory commitments and component shortages.",

          "chunk_text": "The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained,  or  when  an  outsourcing  partner  has  delayed  shipments  of  completed  products  to  the  Company,  the  Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company's  business  and  financial performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected  depending  on  the  time  required  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  from  the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\n## The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.\n\nThe  Company  offers  complex  hardware  and  software  products  and  services  that  can  be  affected  by  design  and  manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company's services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues  and  defects  in  the  hardware,  software  and  services  it  offers.  Failure  to  do  so  can  result  in  widespread  technical  and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims,  recalls,  product  replacements  or  modifications,  write-offs  of  inventory,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and/or  intangible assets,  and  significant  warranty  and  other  expenses,  including  litigation  costs  and  regulatory  fines.  Quality  problems  can  also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market  acceptance,  reduced  demand  for  products  and  services,  delay  in  new  product  and service introductions and lost sales.\n\n## The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe  Company  records  a  write-down  for  product  and  component  inventories  that  have  become  obsolete  or  exceed  anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the  asset  exceeds  its  fair  value.  Although  the  Company  believes  its  inventory,  capital  assets,  inventory  prepayments  and  other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments. Manufacturing  purchase  obligations  cover  the  Company's  forecasted  component  and  manufacturing  requirements,  typically  for periods  up  to  150  days.  Because  the  Company's  markets  are  volatile,  competitive  and  subject  to  rapid  technology  and  price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\n## The  Company  relies  on  access  to  third-party  intellectual  property,  which  may  not  be  available  to  the  Company  on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in  the  future  may  compete,  current  extensive  patent  coverage  and  the  rapid  rate  of  issuance  of  new  patents,  the  Company's products  and  services  can  unknowingly  infringe  existing  patents  or  intellectual  property  rights  of  others.  From  time  to  time,  the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.",

Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU  products.  Similarly,  certain  non-proprietary  materials  or  components  such  as  memory,  printed  circuit  boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If  the  delivery  of  such  supply  is  delayed  or  does  not  occur  for  any  reason,  it  could  materially  impact  our  ability  to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand  could  result  in  excess  inventory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs,  particularly  since  we  have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty  manufacturing  suppliers  purchase  are  complex,  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  substitute  one  supplier  for  another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.  Also,  some  of  these  materials  and  components  may  be  subject  to  rapid  changes  in  price  and  availability. Interruption  of  supply  or  increased  demand  in  the  industry  could  cause  shortages  and  price  increases  in  various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing  suppliers  are  unable  to  procure  materials  for  manufacturing  our  products,  our  business  would  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Failure  to  achieve  expected  manufacturing  yields  for  our  products  could  negatively  impact  our  financial results.\n\nSemiconductor  manufacturing  yields  are  a  result  of  both  product  design  and  process  technology,  which  is  typically proprietary  to  the  manufacturer,  and  low  yields  can  result  from  design  failures,  process  technology  failures  or  a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during  production,  we  may  fail  to  achieve  acceptable  yields  or  experience  product  delivery  delays.  We  cannot  be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies  needed  to  manufacture  future  generations  of  our  products  profitably  or  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are  implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay  in  the  technology  transitions  to  smaller  process  technologies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",

We continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages, including significant constraints  with  certain  critical  components  which  prevents  us  from  completing  manufacturing  of  certain  of  our  products.  For example, we saw an additional unanticipated supply challenge with COVID-19 related lockdowns in certain parts of China in the second half of fiscal 2022 that resulted in a severe shortage of certain critical components. While we did see some easing of the industry-wide supply constraints towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect such constraints to continue and the duration of which is uncertain. Additionally, we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our  suppliers  or  contract  manufacturers  including  capacity  or  cost  problems  resulting  from  industry  consolidation,  or  strong demand for those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products. During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build  new  products  in  a  timely  manner  in  the  quantities  or  configurations  needed. Accordingly,  our  revenue  and  gross  margins could suffer until other sources can be developed.\n\nOur operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited  sources,  and  a  global  economic  downturn  and  related  market  uncertainty  could  negatively  impact  the  availability  of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.\n\nWe believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we participate may grow quickly,  which  may  make  it  difficult  to  quickly  obtain  significant  component  capacity;  as  we  acquire  companies  and  new technologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets.\n\nManufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal  course  of  business,  in  order  to  improve  manufacturing  lead-time  performance  and  to  help  ensure  adequate  component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. When facing  component  supply-related  challenges  we  have  increased  our  efforts  in  procuring  components  in  order  to  meet  customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. In recent periods, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages, caused in part  by  the  COVID-19 pandemic. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charges in future periods if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.  If  we  fail  to  anticipate  customer  demand  properly,  an  oversupply  of  parts  could  result  in  excess  or  obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. For additional information and a further discussion of current impacts and  risks  related  to  our  significant  supply  constraints,  inventory  commitments  and  our  purchase  commitments  with  contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Results of Operations-Product Gross Margin-Supply Constraints Impacts and Risks, Liquidity and Capital Resources-Inventory Supply Chain and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable.\n\nOur level of product gross margins declined in fiscal 2022 and have declined in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis, and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors, including:\n\n- Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group\n- Introduction  of  new  products,  including  products  with  price-performance  advantages,  and  new  business  models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings",

Changes to the Company's business practices  to  comply  with  new  laws  and  regulations  or  in  connection  with  other  legal  proceedings  could  negatively  impact  the reputation  of  the  Company's  products  for  privacy  and  security  and  otherwise  adversely  affect  the  experience  for  users  of  the Company's products and services, and result in  harm  to  the  Company's  reputation,  loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n\n## The  Company's  business  is  subject  to  a  variety  of  U.S.  and  international  laws,  rules,  policies  and  other  obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data  and  biometric  data.  Health  data  and  financial  data  are  subject  to  additional  privacy,  security  and  breach  notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these obligations.  If  the  Company  fails  to  adequately  comply  with  these  rules  and  requirements,  or  if  health  data  or  financial  data  is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company's agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company's products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures  and  product  pricing  actions  that  the  Company  may  take  in  response  to  such  pressures;  increased  competition;  the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company's services; the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its  product  and  service  offerings;  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates;  inflation  and  other  macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand  for  that  product  could  significantly  impact  quarterly  net  sales.  The  Company  could  also  be  subject  to  unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues with new product or service introductions,  information  technology  system  failures  or  network  disruptions,  or  failure  of  one  of  the  Company's  logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.",

Service provider product orders decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of  expanding  network  infrastructures;  the  availability  of  funding;  and  the  extent  to  which  service  providers  are  affected  by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result  of  any  slowdown  in  capital  expenditures  by  service  providers  (which  may  be  more  prevalent  during  a  global  economic downturn,  or  periods  of  economic,  political  or  regulatory  uncertainty),  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example, in  the  past,  many  of  our  service  provider  customers  have  been  materially  and  adversely  affected  by  slowdowns  in  the  general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability,  resulting  in  business  failures  and  substantial  reductions  in  spending  and  expansion  plans.  These  conditions  have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and could affect our business and operating results in any future period.  Finally,  service  provider  customers  typically  have  longer  implementation  cycles;  require  a  broader  range  of  services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.\n\n## Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.\n\nIf  we  fail  to  manage  distribution  of  our  products  and  services  properly,  or  if  our  distributors'  financial  condition  or  operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. A substantial  portion  of  our  products  and  services  is  sold through  our  channel  partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Our  channel  partners  include  systems  integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network",

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Subscription, Product and Services Offerings\n\nWe enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloudhosted  offerings,  term-based,  royalty,  and  perpetual  software  licenses,  associated  software  maintenance  and  support  plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights,  or  options  to  either  renew  monthly  on-premise  term-based  licenses  or  use  committed  funds  to  purchase  other  Adobe products or services.\n\nFully  hosted  subscription  services  (SaaS)  allow  customers  to  access  hosted  software  during  the  contractual  term  without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.\n\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically  accounted  for  utilizing  the  'as-invoiced'  practical  expedient.  Revenue  for  subscriptions  sold  as  a  fee  per  period  is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.\n\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\n\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent  stand-ready  performance  obligations.  Revenue  from  these  subscription  support  plans  is  recognized  ratably  over  their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\n\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all  other  revenue  recognition  criteria  are  met,  and  classified  as  product  revenue  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income. Revenue  from  on-premise  term  license  or  term  licensing  arrangements  with  unilateral  cancellation  rights  or  monthly  renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\n\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.  Our  transaction-based  advertising  offerings,  where  fees  are  based  on  a  number  of  impressions  per  month  and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the 'asinvoiced' practical expedient.\n\n## Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both onpremise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services.

If we fail to do these things  well,  actual  or  perceived  security  vulnerabilities  in  our  products  and  services,  data  corruption  issues,  or  reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services,  or  to  use  competing  products  or  services.  Customers  may  also  spend  more  on  protecting  their  existing  computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely  to  install  or  enable  security  patches,  or  may  otherwise  fail  to  adopt  adequate  security  practices.  Any  of  these  could adversely  affect  our  reputation  and  revenue.  Actual  or  perceived  vulnerabilities  may  lead  to  claims  against  us.  Our  license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will  withstand  legal  challenges. At  times,  to  achieve  commercial  objectives,  we  may  enter  into  agreements  with  larger  liability exposure to customers.\n\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.\n\nDisclosure  and  misuse  of  personal  data  could  result  in  liability  and  harm  our  reputation. As  we  continue  to  grow  the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers  and  users.  The  continued  occurrence  of  high-profile  data  breaches  provides  evidence  of  an  external  environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also  enable  our  customers  and  users  to  store  and  process  personal  data  on-premises  or,  increasingly,  in  a  cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may  take  to  address  customer  or  user  concerns,  or  constraints  on  our  flexibility  to  determine  where  and  how  to  operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.\n\nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services.\n\n## Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.\n\n## Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses\n\nFor platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.",

      "answer": "AVGO highlights that underutilization of its proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities could lead to higher average unit costs and lower gross margins due to the fixed costs associated with these facilities. INTC emphasizes that its high fixed cost structure, driven by capital-intensive R&D and manufacturing investments (e.g., $16.5 billion in R&D in 2024), makes it difficult to reduce costs quickly in response to lower demand, and has led to asset impairments and accelerated depreciation, such as $3.1 billion in charges related to Intel 7. ORCL notes that the majority of its cloud and license business costs are fixed in the short term, which supports margin expansion as revenues grow, particularly through recurring revenue streams like cloud services and license support. Together, these perspectives show that AVGO is focused on absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, INTC is grappling with the financial risk of fixed R&D and capacity investments, and ORCL benefits from fixed cost leverage in a cloud-first, recurring revenue model.",

Our private cloud infrastructure suite of solutions are available directly from Broadcom, resellers and distributors, hyperscale cloud providers, value-added OEMs and VMware cloud service provider partners. VMware Cloud Foundation ('VCF') provides license portability, which enables customers to purchase subscriptions of VCF software and move their VCF environments between on-premises data centers and supported cloud endpoints. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe, VMware, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stockbased compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, and i nventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence.\n\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\n\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.\n\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\n\nSelling , general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs, which include direct transaction costs and integration costs, and other corporate expenses.\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D'), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with our acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&amp;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nRestructuring and other charges. Restructuring and other charges consist primarily of non-recurring charges related to compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, IP litigation, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalization of product development program costs, facility and l ease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&amp;D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt i s s uance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.\n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains and losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nProvision for income taxes. We benefit from the tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax i ncentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax i ncentives are scheduled",

          "chunk_text": "ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have additional project delays or project cancellations in the future. M oreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality  information, intellectual property , and foundry  capacity , among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain.\n\n## We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.\n\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&amp;D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We incurred R&amp;D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, A I, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneA PI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utiliz ation of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.\n\nThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical lev els. In recent y ears, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utiliz ing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV  and high-NA  EUV  lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utiliz ation of ex isting facilities, facility  construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employ ment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. A s we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, M alaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to write off inv entory  or record ex cess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we recorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in ti me when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud l i censes and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are recognized over ti me. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.\n\nProviding choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure software licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services revenues represented 37%, 32% and 25% of our total revenues during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nOur cloud and license business' revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:\n\n\u00b7 expected growth in our cloud services offerings; and\n\n\u00b7 continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license and license support offerings.\n\nWe believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business' total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make i nvestments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.\n\nOur cloud and license business' margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fi xed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers' cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## I ndex to Financial Statements\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations from Contracts with Customers\n\nTrade receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2024 and 2023. The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was approximately $9.0 billion and $8.3 billion. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been i s s ued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. In each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fi s cal quarter. These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and, combined with foreign exchange rate fl uctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were $97.9 billion, of which we expect to recognize approximately 39% as revenues over the next twelve months, 36% over the subsequent month 13 to month 36, 19% over the subsequent month 37 to month 60 and the remainder thereafter.\n\n## Sales of Financing Receivables\n\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts' dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, $1.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition's measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred.",

Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. A dditionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved.

Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $862,140 and $851,972 as of A ugust 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usage-based royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of November 3, 2024 were approximately $20.5 billion. We expect approximately 43% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. For contracts with termination for convenience rights, our customers generally do not exercise those rights. In addition, the majority of our revenue is from contracts with a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods.\n\n## 4. Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the VMware Merger. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger was indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash or 2.52 shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis). The stockholder election was prorated, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, in each case, was equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger. Based on the VMware stockholders' elections, the VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock with a fair value of $53,398 million.\n\nWe funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Term Loans, as defined and discussed in Note 10.

The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\n\nOn June 28, 2021, we simplified our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. IP to the United States via domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. The Domestication more closely aligns our corporate structure to our operating structure in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting conclusions and changes to U.S. and European tax laws. The impact of  the  Domestication,  which  is  regarded  as  a  change  in  tax  status,  resulted  in  a  discrete  benefit  primarily  from  revaluing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $244 million in fiscal year 2022.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.\n\nOur  effective  tax  rates  for  fiscal  years  2021  and  2020  were  lower  than  the  U.S.  federal  statutory  rate  of  21%  due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the  U.S.  federal  statutory  tax  rate,  recognition  of  U.S.  federal  research  tax  credits,  and  excess  tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.05 billion and $232 million of cumulative undistributed  earnings  held  by  certain  subsidiaries  in  Israel  and  the  United  Kingdom,  respectively.  We  have  not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\n\nAs  of  January  30,  2022  and  January  31,  2021,  we  had  a  valuation  allowance  of  $907  million  and  $728  million, respectively, related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $397 million, $345 million and $341 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $341 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 30, 2022, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $102 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2042. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.24 billion, of which $1.18 billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $55 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for  changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization  of  federal,  state,  and  foreign  net  operating  losses  and  tax  credit  carryforwards  may  also  be  subject  to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign  tax  provisions.  If  any  such  limitations  apply,  the  federal,  state,  or  foreign  net  operating  loss  and  tax  credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had $1.01 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $808 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, $181 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $808 million of net unrecognized tax benefits as of January 30, 2022 consisted of $670 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $138 million reflected as a net reduction to the deferred tax assets.",

      "answer": "IBM explicitly acknowledges that environmental costs, including those tied to climate change, regulatory compliance, and potential liabilities, could result in increased operational costs, cleanup expenses, and fines, but it asserts that these will not disproportionately affect its financial position. QCOM highlights that environmental compliance expenditures, particularly related to evolving climate change regulations and manufacturing processes, could increase direct and indirect costs, disrupt operations due to natural disasters, and negatively impact gross profit due to fixed cost exposure in manufacturing. TXN, while less detailed, includes environmental costs as part of its 'Other' business activities, indicating that such costs are recognized and accounted for at the corporate level, though not explicitly itemized in segment reporting. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three companies face environmental cost pressures, IBM frames them as manageable, QCOM emphasizes operational and regulatory risk, and TXN treats them as a broader corporate expense without granular transparency.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAlthough the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security.\n\nAs a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy, AI and data protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company's business, including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance obligations, including with respect to the increased regulatory activity around the security of critical infrastructure, IoT devices, customer industries (e.g., financial services) and various customer and government supply chain security programs. As the reliance on data grows for the company and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company's business, risks, and reputation will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of cybersecurity, AI, data protection and privacy laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms and data location; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining certain offerings.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws and Regulations\n\nThe Company Could Incur Substantial Costs Related to Climate Change and Other Environmental Matters: IBM, like other companies, is subject to potential climate-related risks and costs such as those resulting from increased severe weather events, prolonged changes in temperature, new regulations affecting hardware products and data centers, carbon taxes, and increased environmental disclosures requested or required by clients, regulators and others. The company is also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect climate change or compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position, results of operations and competitive position.\n\nTax Matters Could Impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before tax es being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax  rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax  assets and liabilities, and changes in tax  laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has issued model rules for a new global minimum tax. Local country adoption of these rules may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. Furthermore, local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous ex amination of its income tax  returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\n\nThe Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note Q, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.",

Our manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fix ed costs relative to a fabless model. We may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products, including in less favorable industry or macroeconomic environments, or due to our failure to win and/or retain designs with OEMs. As a result, from time to time our manufacturing facilities operate at lower capacity levels, while the fix ed costs associated with such facilities continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.\n\nWe are subject to many complex environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and rules in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing and other facilities. The regulatory landscape in these areas continues to evolve, and we anticipate additional laws, regulations and rules in the future. In particular, new, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules, including relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investments in production processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. In addition, certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property, or parties who arranged for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities, for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances. As a result, we may incur clean-up costs in connection with any such removal or remediation efforts, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites. In addition, we could be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. If we, or companies or facilities we acquire or have acquired, in the past failed or in the future fail to comply with any such laws and regulations, then we could incur regulatory penalties, fines and legal liabilities; suspension of production; significant compliance requirements; alteration of our manufacturing, assembly or test processes; restriction on our ability to modify or expand our facilities; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot make assurances that we will at all times be in compliance with such laws, regulations, rules and permits. See also the risk factor titled 'Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.'\n\nClimate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, climate change could cause certain natural disasters, such as drought, wildfires, storms, flooding or rising sea levels, to occur more frequently or with greater intensity, which could pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers' facilities, could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of such facilities, and could increase or decrease temperatures resulting in increased operating costs and/or business disruption.\n\nWe have manufacturing facilities in Asia and Europe, and the primary warehouses where we store finished goods are located in Asia. If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, drought or other natural disasters, effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts were to damage, destroy or disrupt any of these facilities, it could disrupt our operations, cease or delay production and shipments of inventory and result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs and lost business. In addition, natural disasters, effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels and supply chains and significant increases in the prices of raw materials. Further, health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, and government and business responses thereto, could affect our manufacturing facilities, including by resulting in quarantines and/or closures, which could result in disruptions to and potential closures of our manufacturing operations. Our manufacturing operations could also be disrupted by cyber-attacks on our IT systems, as described in the Risk Factor below titled 'Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.'\n\nOur manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials, equipment and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, including in some cases sole suppliers, particularly in Asia. There may be cases where supplies of raw materials, equipment and other products are interrupted or limited by natural disaster, geopolitical conflict, accident or some other event affecting a supplier or source of raw materials; supply is suspended due to quality or other issues; there is a shortage of supply due to a rapid increase in demand; and/or we or our suppliers are prohibited from utilizing certain raw materials, or products or components that incorporate such raw materials, due to government restrictions related to the countries from which such raw materials originate, and acceptable alternative suppliers, raw materials or raw materials sources are not available or not available in acceptable time frames or upon acceptable terms, among others, which could impact production and prevent us from",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in ev aluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, ADBE noted that downward pricing pressure from intense competition and evolving market conditions, particularly in AI-driven markets, could negatively impact gross margins. INTC highlighted that changes in manufacturing strategies, including extending the useful lives of machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years, affected depreciation costs and thus gross margin calculations. NVDA cited inventory overestimation, supply chain volatility, and demand unpredictability\u2014especially in new markets like generative AI and cryptocurrency-related GPU usage\u2014as key risks that have historically and could continue to negatively impact gross margins. Together, these perspectives show that while ADBE is sensitive to competitive pricing in software markets, INTC is managing gross margin pressures through asset lifecycle decisions, and NVDA faces margin volatility due to hardware supply-demand imbalances and emerging market adoption patterns.",

      "question": "How do AMD, CRM, and MSFT each characterize their exposure to the Australian Dollar, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to managing foreign exchange risk in their international operations?",
      "answer": "AMD's exposure to the Australian Dollar appears minimal or non-existent in its 2023 foreign currency forward contracts, as it reports no notional amount or fair value gain/loss associated with the currency. In contrast, CRM explicitly lists the Australian Dollar among the key currencies it is exposed to, citing risks from fluctuations that could adversely impact its financial results and cash flows, and notes its use of short-term forward contracts to manage such exposures. Similarly, MSFT identifies the Australian Dollar as one of its principal currency exposures and states that it monitors exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of its foreign currency positions, including hedges. This reveals that while AMD may not have material exposure requiring hedging, CRM and MSFT actively manage their AUD exposure through different operational and financial strategies, reflecting the scale and geographic diversity of their international operations.",

      "answer": "Adobe reports a significant increase in sales and marketing expenses from $3.244 billion in 2019 to $4.321 billion in 2022, reflecting its focus on scaling subscription revenue, which grew to $14.573 billion in the same period. Microsoft notes an $1.7 billion (8%) rise in sales and marketing expenses, attributing it to investments in commercial sales and LinkedIn, with a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%. Qualcomm saw a smaller $32 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, part of a broader $110 million rise in SG&A costs, primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses from the Veoneer deal and higher employee and litigation costs. Collectively, Adobe and Microsoft are making substantial investments in sales and marketing to drive growth, while Qualcomm's increase is more modest and tied to strategic acquisitions and internal cost pressures.",

      "answer": "ADBE recognizes product revenue at the point in time when software is made available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met, and classifies it as product revenue. This reflects a traditional on-premise software licensing model. CSCO experienced a 6% increase in product revenue in fiscal 2022, despite supply constraints and global macroeconomic challenges, showing resilience in its hardware and networking product offerings. QCOM, on the other hand, recognizes product revenue upon transfer of control to the customer, typically at the time of shipment, aligning with a semiconductor and integrated circuit sales model. These differences highlight ADBE's shift toward subscription-based SaaS offerings, CSCO's ongoing transition to software and subscription services while maintaining a strong product revenue base, and QCOM's reliance on hardware product sales tied to licensing and royalty-based ecosystems.",

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Subscription, Product and Services Offerings\n\nWe enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloudhosted  offerings,  term-based,  royalty,  and  perpetual  software  licenses,  associated  software  maintenance  and  support  plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights,  or  options  to  either  renew  monthly  on-premise  term-based  licenses  or  use  committed  funds  to  purchase  other  Adobe products or services.\n\nFully  hosted  subscription  services  (SaaS)  allow  customers  to  access  hosted  software  during  the  contractual  term  without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.\n\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically  accounted  for  utilizing  the  'as-invoiced'  practical  expedient.  Revenue  for  subscriptions  sold  as  a  fee  per  period  is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.\n\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\n\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent  stand-ready  performance  obligations.  Revenue  from  these  subscription  support  plans  is  recognized  ratably  over  their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\n\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all  other  revenue  recognition  criteria  are  met,  and  classified  as  product  revenue  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income. Revenue  from  on-premise  term  license  or  term  licensing  arrangements  with  unilateral  cancellation  rights  or  monthly  renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\n\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.  Our  transaction-based  advertising  offerings,  where  fees  are  based  on  a  number  of  impressions  per  month  and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the 'asinvoiced' practical expedient.\n\n## Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both onpremise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Fiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we delivered growth in total revenue and strong profitability in a challenging environment impacted by significant supply  constraints,  rising  component  and  related  costs,  and  the  Russia  and  Ukraine  war.  We  remain  focused  on  delivering innovation  across  our  technologies  to  assist  our  customers  in  executing  on  their  digital  transformations.  We  continue  to  be negatively impacted by supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages. While we did see some easing of the supply constraints towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect the constraints to continue and the duration is uncertain. We have, and continue to take, multiple steps in order to mitigate the component shortages and deliver products to our customers. We continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.\n\nTotal  revenue  increased  by  3%  compared  with  fiscal  2021. Within  total  revenue,  product  revenue  increased  by  6%  and  service revenue decreased by 2%. Fiscal 2022 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2021, thus our results for fiscal 2022 reflect one less week compared with fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, total software revenue was flat at $15.1 billion across all product areas and service. Within total software revenue, subscription revenue increased 3%. Total gross margin decreased by 1.5 percentage points. Product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points, largely driven by increased costs related to supply constraints and to a lesser extent, product mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 1.3 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.3 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased 13%, driven by an increase of 12% in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 44 million shares.\n\nIn  terms  of  our  geographic  segments,  revenue  from  the Americas  increased  by  $0.7  billion,  EMEA  revenue  increased  by  $0.8 billion and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $0.3 billion.\n\nFrom a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue growth in the commercial, enterprise and service provider markets partially offset by a decline in the public sector market.\n\nFrom a product category perspective, total product revenue increased 6% year over year, driven by growth in revenue in Secure, Agile Networks of 5%; Internet for the Future of 17%; End-to-End Security of 9% and Optimized Application Experiences of 11%; partially offset by a product revenue decline in Collaboration of 5%.\n\n## Russia and Ukraine War\n\nIn March 2022, in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cisco announced its intention to stop business operations in Russia and Belarus for the foreseeable future. Those operations in Russia and Belarus included sales, services and related support functions. Further, on June 23, 2022, we announced that we will begin an orderly wind-down and exit of our business in Russia and Belarus.\n\nOur business operations in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, collectively, comprised approximately 1% of our total revenue for the year ended July 31, 2021. Russia and Belarus, collectively, represented less than 0.1% of our total assets at the end of fiscal 2022. As a result of the war and the resulting events, we have not recognized revenue in these countries effective March 2022. The negative impact  to  total  revenue  was  approximately  $200  million  for  fiscal  2022,  which  includes  committed  revenue  we  would  have otherwise recognized, charges for uncollectible receivables, and other items. Further, we also assessed the risk to the recoverability of our assets and other potential financial exposures in these countries. We have reserved for the non-recoverability of substantially all of our assets in Russia and Belarus. As a result, we have recognized certain non-recurring charges of $91 million in cost of sales and operating expenses in fiscal 2022 related to non-recoverability of certain assets, special personnel-related charges in order to support impacted employees, and severance and other exit related costs.\n\nThe ongoing effect of the Russia and Ukraine war are difficult to predict due to the other uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A.

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nindefinite-lived intangible assets are quantitatively assessed for impairment, if necessary, by comparing their estimated fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and longlived assets may be based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, expected selling price and/or other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when appropriate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of such assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values.\n\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated.\n\nRevenue Recognition. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing of our intellectual property. We also generate revenues from licensing system software and by performing development and other services and from other product sales. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our performance obligations.\n\nRevenues from sales of our products are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. Revenues from providing services are typically recognized over time as our performance obligation is satisfied. Revenues from providing services and licensing system software were each less than 5% of total revenues for all periods presented.\n\nWe grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale or use of certain wireless products. Licensees pay royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay a fixed license fee in one or more installments. Sales-based royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). We broadly provide per unit royalty caps that apply to certain categories of complete wireless devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches, and provide for a maximum royalty amount payable per device. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licensee-by-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nLicense agreements that require payment of license fees contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual property that exists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated. Since we expect to expend efforts to develop and transfer updates to our licensed portfolio on an even basis, license fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is executed and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement.

Business under 'Seasonality' of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nDistributors and original equipment manufacturers ('OEMs'), or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer's organization. Certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers' requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of our products to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. Such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances.\n\nOur software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stock-based compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, inventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence, and acquisition costs, which include direct transaction costs and acquisition-related costs.\n\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\n\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.\n\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\n\nSelling , general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs and other corporate expenses.\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D'), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with the acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&amp;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges. Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalizing product development program costs, facility and lease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&amp;D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.",

However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.\n\nIn addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated.\n\nSegment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:\n\n",

      "answer": "ADBE shows rising infrastructure costs through increased data center costs embedded in its services and other revenue segment, noting that these costs were partially offset by decreases in professional and consulting fees in fiscal 2023. NVDA highlights infrastructure costs as a negatively impacting factor, particularly in its data center products, where a defect in a third-party component led to significant warranty and repair costs, and broader supply chain pressures increased logistics and facilities expenses. ORCL discloses infrastructure costs as part of its cloud and license business, where personnel and infrastructure-related expenses dominate, and the company emphasizes the importance of managing these costs to support its cloud services and license support offerings. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face rising infrastructure costs, ADBE focuses on cost containment within services, NVDA grapples with unexpected defect-related expenses, and ORCL integrates infrastructure investments into its cloud growth strategy.",

      "answer": "ADBE increased its accrued compensation and benefits from $375 million in 2020 to $490 million in 2021, reflecting a 30.7% rise, indicating a growing investment in employee compensation. AMD reported a more significant increase, from $513 million in 2020 to $705 million in 2021, a 37.4% increase, suggesting a more aggressive scaling of workforce-related costs. INTC, on the other hand, saw an increase from $348 million in 2020 to $515 million in 2021, a 47.9% jump, which aligns with its restructuring and operational realignment activities. Collectively, these trends show that all three companies increased their investment in human capital, but with differing magnitudes that may reflect their respective talent acquisition and retention strategies during the tech sector's expansion.",

        "Hop 1: ADBE \u2192 Accrued Compensation and Benefits: ADBE's accrued compensation and benefits increased from $375M (2020) to $490M (2021), showing a significant investment in workforce-related liabilities.",
        "Hop 2: AMD \u2192 Accrued Compensation and Benefits: AMD's accrued compensation and benefits rose from $513M (2020) to $705M (2021), indicating a larger proportional increase compared to ADBE, possibly tied to growth in headcount or compensation levels.",
        "Hop 3: INTC \u2192 Accrued Compensation and Benefits: INTC's accrued compensation and benefits increased from $348M (2020) to $515M (2021), the highest percentage increase among the three, aligning with restructuring and strategic shifts."

      "question": "How do ACN, CRM, and CSCO each approach debt repayment in their 2024 financial strategies, and what does this reveal about their respective capital structures and liquidity priorities?",
      "answer": "ACN made repayments of debt totaling $771,246 thousand in 2024, marking a significant shift in its capital structure as it had no such repayments in 2023. CRM repaid $1,182 thousand in debt during its 2024 fiscal year, continuing a pattern of modest debt reduction from $1,000 thousand in the prior year. In contrast, CSCO aggressively repaid $9,826 thousand in debt in 2024, a substantial increase from $500 thousand in 2023, indicating a stronger focus on debt reduction. This comparison reveals that while all three companies are addressing debt, they differ significantly in scale and urgency, with CSCO taking the most aggressive stance, CRM maintaining a moderate and consistent approach, and ACN initiating a new repayment strategy.",

      "question": "How do AVGO, MSFT, and TXN differ in their net change in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2024, and what does this reveal about their respective liquidity management and capital allocation strategies?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2024, AVGO reported a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $4,841 million, driven largely by significant financing outflows related to debt repayments and share repurchases. MSFT experienced a substantial net decrease of $16,389 million, primarily due to large-scale investing activities, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. In contrast, TXN saw a modest net increase of $236 million, reflecting a more conservative approach with balanced capital expenditures and strong short-term investment liquidity. These differences highlight AVGO's aggressive debt and equity management, MSFT's heavy investment in growth initiatives, and TXN's measured liquidity preservation strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents: AVGO reported a net decrease of $4,841 million in 2024, largely due to financing activities such as $25,978 million spent on acquisitions and $7,176 million on share repurchases, offset by $39,954 million in long-term borrowings.",
        "Hop 2: MSFT \u2192 Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents: MSFT experienced a significant net decrease of $16,389 million in 2024, primarily due to $69,132 million spent on acquisitions and $44,477 million on capital expenditures, despite strong operating cash flow of $118,548 million.",
        "Hop 3: TXN \u2192 Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents: TXN reported a small net increase of $236 million in 2024, with capital expenditures of $4,820 million offset by $11,187 million in proceeds from short-term investments, indicating a more conservative liquidity strategy."

      "answer": "Microsoft reported state net operating loss carryforwards of $899 million as of June 30, 2024, with varying expiration dates ranging from fiscal year 2025 to 2044 or indefinite carryforward periods. Oracle disclosed state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.1 billion as of May 31, 2024, with $2.0 billion expiring between fiscal 2025 and 2044 and $49 million not subject to expiration. Qualcomm had unused state net operating loss carryforwards of $817 million expiring from 2025 through 2037 as of September 29, 2024. The differences in the scale and expiration timelines of these carryforwards suggest varied historical profitability and loss utilization strategies across the companies, with Oracle holding the largest state NOL position and Qualcomm having a more constrained expiration window compared to Microsoft\u2019s mix of finite and indefinite carryforwards.",

QCOM, while not providing a specific numerical figure, acknowledges that it recognizes excess tax benefits associated with share-based awards in its income tax expense when realized, indicating a similar accounting treatment aligned with industry peers. The variation in magnitude suggests differing levels of reliance on stock-based compensation as a component of employee compensation, with AVGO showing a steadily declining benefit over the three years, while MSFT's benefit has remained relatively stable.

Share-based compensation expense is adjusted to exclude amounts related to share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Proceedings. We are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings. Litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain, and we face difficulties in evaluating or estimating likely outcomes or ranges of possible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigations in particular. Investigations by antitrust and trade regulation agencies are not conducted in a consistent manner across jurisdictions. Further, each country and agency has different sets of laws, rules and regulations, both substantive and procedural, as well as different legal principles, theories and potential remedies, and some agencies may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goals. Depending on the jurisdiction, these investigations can involve non-transparent procedures under which we may not receive access to evidence relied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theories or evidence considered or relied upon by the agency. Unlike in civil litigation in the United States, in foreign proceedings, we may not be entitled to discovery or depositions, allowed to cross-examine witnesses or confront our accusers. As a result, we may not be aware of, and may not be entitled to know, all allegations against us, or the information or documents provided to, or discovered or prepared by, the agency. Accordingly, we may have little or no idea what an agency's intent is with respect to liability, penalties or the timing of a decision. In many cases the agencies are given significant discretion, and any available precedent may have limited, if any, predictive value in their jurisdictions or other jurisdictions. Accordingly, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. A broad range of remedies with respect to our business practices that are deemed to violate applicable laws are potentially available. These remedies may include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or to modify our business practices.\n\nIf there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred associated with pending legal and regulatory proceedings, we disclose such fact, and if reasonably estimable, we provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss. We record our best estimate of a loss related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings and revise our estimates and update our disclosures accordingly. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Our legal costs associated with defending ourself are recorded to expense as incurred.\n\nForeign Currency. Certain foreign subsidiaries use a local currency as the functional currency. Resulting translation gains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains or losses related to balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nIncome Taxes. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in income in the period such changes are enacted. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We include interest and penalties related to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, within income tax expense. We classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets. We recognize excess tax benefits and shortfall tax detriments associated with share-based awards in the consolidated statements of operations, as a component of income tax expense, when realized.\n\nOur income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and the assessment of our income tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes, including those related to special deductions such as FDII (foreign-derived intangible income), tax incentives, intercompany research and development cost-sharing arrangements, transfer pricing, tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax assets. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions we have taken or that we plan to take on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by taxing authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.

In addition, we may also generate cash from the sale of assets and debt or equity financings from time to time.\n\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) cash dividend payments (if and when declared by our Board of Directors), (v) interest and principal payments related to our $69,847 million of outstanding indebtedness, and (vi) payment of income taxes. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in the fiscal year ending November 2, 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024. Our debt and liquidity needs increased in fiscal year 2024 as a result of completing the VMware Merger. We funded the cash portion of the consideration with net proceeds from the issuance of $30,390 million in term loans (the '2023 Term Loans'), as well as cash on hand. We also assumed $8,250 million of VMware's outstanding senior unsecured notes. During fiscal year 2024, we made repayments of $16,795 million on our 2023 Term Loans.\n\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months. For additional information regarding our cash requirement from contractual obligations, indebtedness and lease obligations, see Note 14. 'Commitments and Contingencies', Note 10. 'Borrowings' and Note 6. 'Leases' in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product l i nes . Any such transaction, or evaluation of potential transactions, could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions. If we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and financial condition could suffer. In such circumstances, we may seek to obtain new debt or equity fi nancing. However, we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to service our senior unsecured notes, the 2023 Term Loans and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above.\n\nIn addition, we may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash tenders and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such tenders, exchanges or purchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. We may also make additional prepayments of the 2023 Term Loans. The amounts involved may be material.",

The net increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities and $383 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock (primarily under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan), partially offset by $4.1 billion in payments to repurchase shares of our common stock, $3.7 billion in cash dividends paid, $1.0 billion in capital ex penditures, $932 million in payments of tax withholdings related to the vesting of share-based awards and $914 million in repayments of notes that matured in May 2024.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, income taxes paid were in excess of our provision, negatively impacting net cash provided by operating activities. This was primarily driven by the adverse impact of the requirement to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures for federal income tax purposes, our payment of $1.0 billion related to certain previously postponed U.S. federal income tax payments from fiscal 2023 and an installment payment for a one-time U.S. repatriation tax accrued in fiscal 2018 of $414 million.\n\nNet changes in our operating assets and liabilities positively impacted our operating cash flows in fiscal 2024 primarily from an increase in accrued customer incentives, which included the impact of timing of related payments, and an increase in accounts payable due to timing and amount of inventory purchases, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues.\n\nDebt. At September 29, 2024, we had $15.0 billion of principal fix ed-rate notes outstanding, $1.4 billion of which matures in May 2025. The remaining debt has maturity dates in 2027 through 2053.\n\nWe have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $4.5 billion of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At September 29, 2024, we had no amounts of commercial paper outstanding. On August 8, 2024, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility, replacing our prior Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 billion, which ex pires on August 8, 2029. At September 29, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nWe expect to issue new debt in the future. The amount and timing of any such new debt will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to maturities of our existing debt, acquisitions and strategic investments, favorable and/or acceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law. Additional information regarding our outstanding debt at September 29, 2024 is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. Debt.'\n\nIncome Taxes. At September 29, 2024, our remaining future payments were $1.0 billion for a one-time U.S. repatriation tax  accrued in fiscal 2018, after application of certain tax  credits, which is payable in installments over the nex t two years. At September 29, 2024, other current liabilities included $530 million for the nex t installment due in January 2025. Beginning in fiscal 2023, for federal income tax  purposes, we are required to capitalize and amortize domestic research and development expenditures over five years and foreign research and development expenditures over fifteen years (such expenditures were previously deducted as incurred). As a result, our cash flows from operations are adversely affected due to significantly higher cash tax payments. However, the adverse cash flow impact will diminish in future years as capitalized research and",

      "question": "How do AMD, Microsoft, and Oracle differ in their reporting and expectations around the timing of revenue recognition from remaining performance obligations, and what does this suggest about their respective revenue visibility and business models?",
      "answer": "AMD mentions that revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied will be recognized in the next 12 months, though it does not provide a dollar figure. Microsoft reports a total remaining performance obligation of $275 billion as of June 30, 2024, with $269 billion related to the commercial segment, and expects to recognize approximately 45% over the next 12 months. Oracle reports $97.9 billion in remaining performance obligations as of May 31, 2024, with 39% expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, 36% in months 13\u201336, and 19% in months 37\u201360. The differences in timing and scale suggest that Microsoft has the largest near-term revenue visibility and a highly commercialized, recurring revenue model, Oracle has a more extended revenue recognition curve with a mix of multi-year contracts and shorter-term deals, and AMD, while not quantifying its obligations, implies a shorter-term focus consistent with its hardware-centric and project-based business model.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## I ndex to Financial Statements\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations from Contracts with Customers\n\nTrade receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2024 and 2023. The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was approximately $9.0 billion and $8.3 billion. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been i s s ued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. In each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fi s cal quarter. These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and, combined with foreign exchange rate fl uctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were $97.9 billion, of which we expect to recognize approximately 39% as revenues over the next twelve months, 36% over the subsequent month 13 to month 36, 19% over the subsequent month 37 to month 60 and the remainder thereafter.\n\n## Sales of Financing Receivables\n\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts' dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, $1.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition's measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred.",

      "question": "How do Apple, AMD, and Cisco Systems each plan to manage their upcoming 2028 long-term debt obligations, and what does this reveal about their differing financial strategies and liquidity positioning?",
      "answer": "Apple plans to manage its $3,121 million long-term debt obligation in 2028 as part of a broader repayment schedule that includes smaller obligations in prior years (e.g., $1,156 million in 2027) and a total of $11,226 million over the full term. AMD has a $1,846 million obligation in 2028, which is relatively consistent with its prior-year amounts (e.g., $1,922 million in 2027), suggesting a more evenly distributed repayment strategy across years. Cisco Systems has a $1,365 million obligation in 2028, which is slightly lower than its 2027 obligation of $1,445 million, indicating a modest decline in near-term debt pressure. Collectively, these figures show that Apple has a more front-loaded repayment in 2028 compared to earlier years, AMD maintains a stable repayment pattern, and Cisco shows a slight reduction in debt due in 2028, reflecting differing liquidity strategies and capital structure management.",

        "Hop 2: AMD \u2192 2028 Long-Term Debt: AMD reports $1,846 million due in 2028, which is only slightly less than the $1,922 million due in 2027, suggesting a relatively flat maturity profile.",

NVDA started the year with $3,389 million in cash and cash equivalents, a much lower base that aligns with its aggressive reinvestment strategy, including $83 million in acquisitions and $9,533 million in stock repurchases. ORCL began the year with $21,383 million in cash and cash equivalents, the highest among the three, which enabled it to fund major acquisitions like Cerner ($27,721 million) and manage substantial debt repayments while still maintaining a cash surplus by year-end.

      "answer": "AMD specifies a precise expected life of 4.98 years for its stock options, with a narrow range across years (4.75 to 4.98), indicating stable and long-term expectations around employee exercise behavior and consistent volatility assumptions. CRM uses historical exercise activity to estimate expected life, suggesting a behavior-driven, retrospective approach to forecasting option exercise patterns. CSCO, in contrast, maintains a fixed expected life of 1.2 years across multiple fiscal years, signaling a short-term outlook on option holding periods and potentially more standardized or less variable employee behavior assumptions. These differences highlight varying strategic and behavioral assumptions across the firms regarding equity compensation.",

Qualcomm (QCOM), while not specifying acquisition spend, emphasized the strategic importance of acquiring technologies and businesses to expand beyond mobile handsets, acknowledging the risks of integration and regulatory hurdles. This shows that ACN focuses on growth through external innovation, CSCO balances strategic investments with shareholder returns, and QCOM prioritizes expansion into new markets through technology acquisition despite integration and regulatory risks.",

We  could  raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:\n\n- facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;\n- acquire complementary businesses or technologies;\n- take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or\n- develop new services and solutions.\n\nAs of August 31, 2022, Cash and cash equivalents were $7.9 billion, compared with $8.2 billion as of August 31, 2021.\n\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table:\n\n",

These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $13.2 billion and issuance of commercial paper of $0.6 billion.\n\nWe  maintain  an  investment  portfolio  of  various  holdings,  types,  and  maturities.  We  classify  our  investments  as  short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio  is  strong,  with  our  cash  equivalents  and  our  available-for-sale  debt  investment  portfolio  consisting  primarily  of  high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.\n\nSecurities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. These  transactions  are  accounted  for  as  a  secured  lending  of  the  securities,  and  the  securities  are  typically  loaned  only  on  an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. As of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we target to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.\n\nWe define  free  cash  flow  as  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  less  cash  used  to  acquire  property  and  equipment.  The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):\n\n",

We routinely acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions, and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products (or enhancing existing products) for mobile handsets, and for industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not be successful, generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or products. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership or variable interests. In addition, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, impairment or other charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.\n\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from associated technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain, and we may become subject to litigation. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models, geographic regions, industries and applications served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of our strategic acquisitions.\n\nIf we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transactions.\n\nMany of our acquisitions and other strategic investments require approval by the United States and/or foreign government agencies. Certain agencies in the past have, and may in the future, deny the transaction or fail to approve in a timely manner, resulting in us not realizing the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction. Future acquisitions or other strategic investments may be more difficult, complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisitions has been or is in the future harmed. Further, if U.S./China relations remain strained, our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from the relevant regulatory agency(ies) in China may be severely impacted. In addition, acquisitions that we have completed could subsequently be reviewed and/or challenged by government agencies, which could result in fines, penalties or other liability, or requirements to divest all or a portion of an acquired business.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING\n\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nWe primarily utilize a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the facilities we own that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF (radio frequency) filter products, we rely on third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. There are a limited number of such third-party suppliers, and even fewer who are capable of manufacturing at the leading process technology nodes or who are willing to operate at older process technology nodes necessary for certain of our integrated circuit products.

QCOM had a significantly larger notional exposure of $1,373 million to the Indian Rupee as of September 29, 2024, indicating a higher level of unhedged or actively managed exposure. TXN, in contrast, proactively hedged its exposure by purchasing $180 million in Indian Rupee forward contracts to mitigate balance sheet risk.

Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies, and exchange rate fluctuations in those jurisdictions may impact our effectiv e tax rate.\n\nOur balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, which are based on year-end 2024 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relativ e to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of less than $1 million.\n\nWe use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may hav e on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2024, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional v alue of $565 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $180 million to buy Indian rupee, $91 million to sell British pounds and $78 million to sell Japanese yen). Similar hedging activ ities existed at year-end 2023.\n\n## Interest rate ris k\n\nWe have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair v alue of our inv estments in cash equiv alents and short-term inv estments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair v alue of our debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair v alue of our inv estments in cash equiv alents and short-term inv estments by about $22 million and decrease the fair v alue of our long-term debt by $952 million. Because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt.",

      "question": "How do Apple, Intel, and NVIDIA differ in their 2023 trends and relative proportions of Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses, and what does this reveal about their respective cost management strategies in a high-pressure technology market?",
      "answer": "Apple reported SG&A expenses of $24.9 billion in 2023, representing 7% of total net sales, showing a slight decline from the previous year. Intel's Marketing, General, and Administrative expenses were $5.6 billion in 2023, a decrease from $7.0 billion in 2022, indicating cost-cutting measures. NVIDIA's Sales, General and Administrative expenses were 4.4% of revenue in 2023, down significantly from 9.1% in the prior year, reflecting improved cost control. These differences suggest that NVIDIA has aggressively reduced SG&A as a proportion of revenue amid strong revenue growth, while Apple maintained a steady proportion, and Intel implemented notable cost reductions.",

Intel highlights its exposure to IP litigation risks, including the potential for costly settlements, injunctions, and the need to pay royalties due to third-party claims or compulsory licensing requirements. Microsoft, meanwhile, emphasizes external regulatory pressure, particularly in Asia, that is driving downward pressure on the royalties it receives for its intellectual property. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies are significantly impacted by royalty-related dynamics, their exposures differ: Adobe treats royalties as a standard accrual, Intel faces litigation-driven royalty risks, and Microsoft confronts regulatory-driven royalty compression.",

Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data-protection measures are significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions.\n\n## We are subject to IP risks, including related litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nWe cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law-as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others -to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in v arious countries and other geopolitical factors. We are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations and governments or courts render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability  to enforce our IP rights under any  of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&amp;D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.\n\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally  license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.\n\nThird parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals, companies, investment litigation entities, other non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by third-party investment firms. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business, impact our reputation or relationship with customers, and disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters and courts in which injunctions are available for non-competitors. For example, in February 2024, R2 Semiconductor, Inc., a non-practicing entity, was able to obtain an injunction and recall order against us and our customers in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany that, if enforced, could have caused significant potential disruption to our and our customers' businesses in Europe. In the past few years, we have faced costly and lengthy lawsuits across multiple jurisdictions selected by non-practicing entities with well-funded third-party investment support, including most notably the V LSI and R2 litigation, which have resulted in significant adverse judgments and settlements.\n\nWe are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. A ny such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, in many instances, we agree to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nAs a result of IP rights claims, we could:\n\n- pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, penalties, or provide accommodations to customers such as through cash payments or discounts;\n- stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n- need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n- enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.\n\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.\n\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Many of our products are designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties.

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1A\n\n## LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\n\nGovernment enforcement under competition laws and new market regulation may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Gov ernments are activ ely enforcing competition laws and regulations and enacting new regulations to interv ene in digital markets, and this includes markets such as the EU, the United Kingdom, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitiv e conduct. U.S. and foreign antitrust authorities hav e prev iously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\n\nFor example, the European Commission ('the Commission') has designated Windows and LinkedIn as core platform serv ices subject to obligations under the EU Digital Markets Act, which prohibits certain self-preferencing behav iors and places limitations on certain data use among other obligations. The Commission also continues to closely scrutinize the design of high-v olume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, av ailable to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Microsoft 365 and Windows can receiv e significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws.\n\nOur portfolio of first-party dev ices continues to grow; at the same time, our OEM partners offer a large v ariety of dev ices for our platforms. As a result, we increasingly both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign gov ernments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, hav e adv anced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\n\nCompetition law enforcement actions and court decisions along with new market regulations may result in fines or hinder our ability to prov ide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiv eness of our products and the rev enue that comes from them. New competition law actions or obligations under market regulation schemes could be initiated, potentially using prev ious actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to av oid them, could adv ersely affect us in a v ariety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the v alue of our assets, adv ersely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their v alue, which may adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nLaws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ('FCPA') and other anti-corruption laws and regulations ('Anti-Corruption Laws') prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, v endors, or agents, and the accounting prov isions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receiv e inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activ ities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receiv e such reports directly and inv estigate them, and also cooperate with inv estigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directiv e, initiated in 2021, which presents compliance challenges as it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also hav e competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselv es. While we dev ote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and hav e implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusiv e activ ity, our employees, partners, vendors, or agents may v iolate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation, which could adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",

We expect that our 2024 Restructuring Plan, in conjunction with other initiatives, will reduce our cost structure while we continue our investments to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver product and process initiatives in furtherance of our strategy. We expect actions pursuant to the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2025, which is subject to change. A ny changes to the estimates or timing will be reflected in our results of operations.\n\nEmployee severance and benefit arrangements includes net charges relating to the 2024 Restructuring Plan of $2.2 billion in 2024. Charges relating to other actions taken to streamline operations and to reduce costs were $294 million in 2024. The charges in 2023 and 2022 primarily related to the 2022 Restructuring Program, which was approved to rebalance our workforce and operations in alignment with our strategy and was completed in Q1 2024. The 2022 Restructuring Program, in conjunction with other initiatives, reduced our cost structure and allowed us to reinvest certain of these cost savings in resources and capacity to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver our products in furtherance of our strategy.\n\nLitigation charges and other includes a charge of $780 million that we recorded in 2024 arising out of the R2 litigation. In 2023, a $1.2 billion benefit was recorded due to the reduction in the previously accrued charge as a result of developments in the V LSI litigation. 2023 charges also included a $401 million charge for an EC-imposed fine and a $353 million termination fee in connection with our inability to timely obtain required regulatory approvals needed to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. Refer to \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about litigation related items.\n\nAsset impairment charges in 2024 includes non-cash charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, including $442 million of non-cash impairments of construction-in-progress assets associated with our decision to exit and outsource manufacturing capabilities for certain internal test hardware; and $103 million of non-cash impairments of operating leased assets and related leasehold improvements resulting from real estate consolidations and exits. Real estate consolidations and exits did not significantly change our operating lease liabilities and may result in future cash outlays for facility restoration or the relocation of operations. In addition, we incurred non-cash impairments relating to goodwill and acquired intangible assets of $3.1 billion in 2024.

If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.\n\nFinally, to the extent that the pandemic harms our business and results of operations, many of the other risks described in this 'Risk Factors' section may be heightened.\n\n## Our competitive position and results of operations could be harmed if we do not compete effectively.\n\nThe  markets  for  our  products  and  services  are  characterized  by  intense  competition,  new  industry  standards,  evolving distribution  models,  limited  barriers  to  entry,  disruptive  technology  developments,  short  product  life  cycles,  customer  price sensitivity, global market conditions and frequent product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at  lower costs or free of charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a  timely  and  cost-effective  manner,  meet  changing  customer  expectations  and  needs,  extend  our  core  technology  into  new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Furthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of these advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our market share. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of our competitors. Further consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive pressures and may harm our results of operations.\n\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section titled 'Competition' in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\n\n## If we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.\n\nThe process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers' rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. Additionally, any delay in the development, acquisition, marketing or launch of a new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position.\n\nConsumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices. While we offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms, if we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed. Releases of new devices or operating systems may make it  more  difficult  for  our  products  to  perform  or  may  require  significant  cost  to  adapt  our  solutions  to  such  devices  or  operating systems. These potential costs and delays could harm our business.\n\n## Introduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations.\n\nThe expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving. Our future success depends on a variety of factors,  including  our  continued  ability  to  innovate,  introduce  new  products  and  services  efficiently,  enhance  and  integrate  our products  and  services  in  a  timely  and  cost-effective  manner,  extend  our  core  technology  into  new  applications,  and  anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Integration of our products and services with one another and other companies' offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on third parties. If any disruptive technology, or competing products, services or operating systems that are not compatible with our solutions, achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer and our business could be harmed.\n\nThe introduction of, or limitations on, certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products.

      "question": "How do Adobe, Cisco, and Intel compare in terms of their total current liabilities relative to their total assets, and what does this reveal about their respective liquidity positions and financial leverage in 2022?",
      "answer": "Adobe reported total current liabilities of $6,932 million against total assets of $27,241 million, resulting in a current liability-to-asset ratio of approximately 25.4%. Cisco showed significantly higher total current liabilities at $25,640 million compared to total assets of $94,002 million, yielding a ratio of about 27.3%. Intel had the highest total current liabilities at $27,462 million relative to its massive total assets of $168,406 million, leading to a ratio of about 16.3%. This comparison suggests that Intel maintained the strongest liquidity position relative to its asset base, while Cisco faced relatively higher short-term obligations in proportion to its total assets, indicating a more leveraged position compared to Adobe and Intel.",

      "answer": "Intel highlights that warranty costs have already adversely impacted sales volume in 2024 due to instability issues with its Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors, and it anticipates potentially higher warranty costs in the future. NVIDIA notes that defects in its products, such as a third-party component defect in its Data Center products, have led to significant warranty liabilities, including a net warranty liability recorded in fiscal year 2023. In contrast, Texas Instruments states that it has historically experienced minimal indemnification losses and a low rate of payments on product claims, and does not believe future warranty or liability claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial statements. This contrast indicates that while Intel and NVIDIA are actively experiencing and provisioning for rising warranty-related risks, Texas Instruments maintains a more stable historical position, suggesting differing levels of exposure and preparedness across the companies.",

We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses.\n\nCosts from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:\n\n- writing off some or all of the v alue of inv entory ;\n- recalling products that have been shipped;\n- providing product replacements or modifications;\n- providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;\n- defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages;\n- paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies; and\n- reputational harm.\n\nThese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. M itigation techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis-or at all-and do not always operate as intended or effectiv ely  resolv e such issues for all applications. We and third parties, such as hardware and software vendors, make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other product issues and/or mitigation techniques can result in product failures, adverse performance and power effects, reboots, system instability  or unav ailability , loss of functionality , data loss or corruption, unpredictable sy stem behav ior, decisions by  customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and other issues. For example, during 2024, some of our customers experienced instability issues when using Intel Core 13  and 14  Gen desktop processors, which required us to undertake an investigation and deploy corrective actions. This adversely impacted sales volume during 2024 and may result in higher warranty costs in the future. th th\n\nProduct issues can damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases or deployment, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, which could harm our business and financial results. Subsequent events or new information can develop that change our assessment of the impact of a product issue. In addition, our liability insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.\n\n## We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.\n\nWe or third parties regularly identify security v ulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them and the components that interact with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"M eltdown.\" A dditional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Security and manageability features in our products cannot make our products absolutely secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory  inquiries or actions ov er these matters.\n\nMitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities in our products, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis-or at all-and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. Export restrictions may impede our ability to provide updates or patches to customers in certain geographies or that appear on sanctions lists, potentially leaving systems unpatched and open to exploitation. Further, sanctions lists may include third parties with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability disclosure, which may impair our ability to receive information about vulnerabilities and to deliver mitigations for them. We and such third parties make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.",

They have in the past and may in the future contain defects, security vulnerabilities, experience failures, or unsatisfactory performance due to issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may also increase when our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, or new versions are released, and when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. AI software products that we or our partners offer rely on training data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain unknown or undetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. A lthough arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used.\n\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property , or expose our customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEM s, ODM s, A IB manufacturers, automotive manufacturers, and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. A ny such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty , support, and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory , and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. A n error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers' perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\n\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party , such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to Our G lobal Operating Business\n\n## Adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\n\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary , or trade policy , disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, including the implementation of tariffs by the USG or other governments, have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:\n\n- increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;\n- increased supply , employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;\n- decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees;\n- the inability  of our suppliers to deliv er on their supply  commitments to us and our customers' or our licensees' inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\n- limits on our ability  to forecast operating results and make business decisions;",

      "question": "How do Apple, Adobe, and Broadcom each characterize the risks that negatively impact their gross margins, and what does this reveal about their distinct cost and market pressures in the technology sector?",
      "answer": "Apple highlights foreign exchange rate risk as a key factor negatively impacting gross margins, estimating a one-day maximum loss of $538 million as of September 28, 2024, due to currency fluctuations. Adobe identifies competitive pressures and significant investments in AI development as key risks, noting that evolving market conditions and customer adoption uncertainty could reduce gross margins. Broadcom points to underutilization of proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities as a risk, where fixed costs may not be fully absorbed, leading to higher average unit costs and lower gross margins. Together, these perspectives reveal that Apple faces macroeconomic and currency-related risks, Adobe contends with innovation and competitive market risks, and Broadcom experiences operational and manufacturing cost risks, each affecting gross margins through different mechanisms.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nThe Company's exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company's assets and liabilities. T o protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\n\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk ('VAR') model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a M onte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively . Changes in the Company's underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company's foreign currency derivatives.",

These costs could adversely impact our margins as we continue to make significant investments in AI development, add AI capabilities to our  offerings  and  scale  our AI  offerings  without  assurance  that  our  customers  and  users  will  adopt  them.  Further,  as  with  any  new  offerings  based  on  new technologies, consumer reception and monetization pathways are uncertain, our strategies may not be successful and our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. New AI offerings and technologies could modify workforce needs, result in negative publicity about AI and decrease demand for our existing products, services and solutions, all of which could adversely impact our business.\n\n## We participate in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could suffer.\n\nThe markets for our products, services and solutions are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Our numerous competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant sales and research and development resources, broad brand awareness, long operating histories or access to large customer bases to small companies whose specialized focuses may allow them to more easily and effectively deploy technical, marketing and financial resources. Our competitors may develop or acquire products, services or solutions that are similar to ours or that achieve greater or faster acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. As a result, current and potential customers may select the products, services or solutions of our competitors. Further, our future success depends on our continued ability to effectively appeal to businesses and consumers. New industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to entry, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity, global market conditions and the frequent entry of new products or competitors may increase downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and adversely affect our renewal, upsell and cross-sell rates as well as our ability to attract new customers. In addition, we ex pect to face more competition as AI continues to advance and be integrated into the markets in which we compete. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their offerings more successfully and efficiently than we do and achieve greater and faster adoption, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our business and financial results. Other companies have, or in the future may obtain, proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our AI offerings. Further, we ex pect AI offerings to be highly competitive and rapidly evolving. For example, we face increasing competition from companies offering generative AI capabilities, including tex t-to-image, tex t-to-video and multi-modal offerings that compete directly with our creative offerings. If we are not able to  provide  products,  services  and  solutions  that  compete  effectively,  we  could  ex perience  reduced  sales  and  our  business  could  be  adversely  affected. For additional  information  regarding  our  competition  and  the  risks  arising  out  of  the  competitive  environment  in  which  we  operate,  see  the  section  titled 'Competition' contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\n\n## If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe our reputation and brands have been, and we expect them to continue to be, important to our business and financial results. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, reputational harm from, among other things, the introduction of new products, features, services, or terms that do not meet customer expectations; our position  on  or  approach  to  new  and  evolving  technologies,  including  AI;  backlash  from  customers,  the  creative  community,  government  entities  or  other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy, ethical or political positions; significant litigation or regulatory actions that negatively reflect on our business practices; data security breaches or compliance failures; and public scrutiny or negative publicity, including being the target of media and social media campaigns, criticizing our actual or perceived actions or inactions, policies, terms, agreements, handling of user privacy, data practices or content. Further, our brands may be negatively affected by uses of our products, services or solutions, particularly our AI offerings, in ways that are out of our control, such as to create or disseminate content that is deemed to be misleading, deceptive or intended to manipulate public opinion, or for illicit, objectionable or illegal ends, or by our failure to respond appropriately and in a timely manner to such uses. Such uses may result in controversy or claims related to defamation, rights of publicity, illegal content, intellectual property infringement, harmful content, misinformation and disinformation, harmful bias, misappropriation, data privacy, derivative uses of third-party AI and personal injury torts. If we fail to appropriately respond to objectionable content created using our products, services or solutions or shared on our platforms, our users may lose confidence in our brands. Entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries in which we operate may also impact our ability to protect our brands. If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our users' trust in us and purchasing decisions and our business and financial results may be adversely affected.",

Our private cloud infrastructure suite of solutions are available directly from Broadcom, resellers and distributors, hyperscale cloud providers, value-added OEMs and VMware cloud service provider partners. VMware Cloud Foundation ('VCF') provides license portability, which enables customers to purchase subscriptions of VCF software and move their VCF environments between on-premises data centers and supported cloud endpoints. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe, VMware, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stockbased compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, and i nventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence.\n\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\n\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.\n\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\n\nSelling , general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs, which include direct transaction costs and integration costs, and other corporate expenses.\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D'), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with our acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&amp;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nRestructuring and other charges. Restructuring and other charges consist primarily of non-recurring charges related to compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, IP litigation, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalization of product development program costs, facility and l ease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&amp;D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt i s s uance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.\n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains and losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nProvision for income taxes. We benefit from the tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax i ncentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax i ncentives are scheduled",

Intel (INTC), on the other hand, declared a cash dividend of $1.599 billion in 2024, though this represents a reduction compared to prior years, potentially reflecting financial pressures or strategic shifts.

      "answer": "Apple highlights the risks associated with purchase commitments, particularly the potential for write-downs and cancellation fees due to forecast inaccuracies and rapid product obsolescence. AMD depends on purchase commitments primarily for wafer and substrate procurement, with noncancellable orders and minimum purchase requirements forming a significant part of its supply chain obligations. Texas Instruments discloses specific financial commitments under purchase agreements, totaling $1.868 billion as of December 31, 2023, with clear multi-year payment breakdowns. The comparative analysis reveals that while Apple emphasizes risk and volatility, AMD focuses on dependency and contractual obligations, and Texas Instruments provides transparent forward-looking financial commitments.",

      "answer": "ADBE includes facilities costs as part of its general and administrative expenses, indicating that these costs are tied to supporting administrative personnel and operations. AVGO allocates facilities costs across multiple functions, including research and development, selling, and general administrative expenses, showing a more distributed impact on its cost structure. NVDA notes that facilities costs are part of broader infrastructure and supply chain expenses that have negatively impacted gross margins, highlighting sensitivity to cost volatility. Together, this reveals that ADBE treats facilities costs as a foundational overhead, AVGO integrates them across operational functions, and NVDA faces margin pressures due to external cost increases, indicating differing strategic sensitivities to facilities-related expenditures.",

The expected div idend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay div idends in the near future. The expected term of the ESPP represents the six-month offering period.\n\nDuring  2024, 2 million shares of common stock were purchased under the ESPP at an av erage purchase price of $111 resulting in aggregate cash proceeds of $265 million. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had $43 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the ESPP, which will be recognized ov er the weighted-av erage period of 0.37 years.\n\n## NOTE 13 - Retirement Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company provides retirement benefit plans in the United States and certain foreign countries.

The  Company matches 75% of employees' contributions up to 6% of their eligible compensation. The Company's contributions to the 401(k) plan for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $78 million, $70 million and $47 million, respectiv ely.\n\n## NOTE 14 - Restructuring Charges\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company implemented a restructuring plan (the 2024 Restructuring Plan) focused on driv ing efficiencies and aligning resources with the Company's largest growth opportunities in the AI and enterprise markets. The 2024 Restructuring Plan will primarily reduce global workforce  by  approximately  4%  of  headcount.  Restructuring  charges  are  included  within  the  All  Other  category  presented  in  Note  4  -  Segment Reporting. Significant asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 6 - Acquisition-related Intangible Assets and Goodwill. The Company expects actions associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. As of December 28, 2024, $89 million of accrued restructuring charges are recorded within Accrued liabilities of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe following table summarizes activ ities and components of liabilities related to the 2024 Restructuring Plan:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Contract Balances\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nA receivable is recorded when an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment exists, such that only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer. Included in trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been invoiced, and are typically related to license revenue or services which are delivered prior to invoicing. As of November 29, 2024, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $2.07 billion, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $66 million. As of December 1, 2023, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $2.22 billion, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $80 million.\n\n## Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables and is based on both specific and general reserves. We maintain general reserves on a collective basis by considering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $14 million and $16 million as of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, respectively.\n\n## Contract Assets\n\nA contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration exists and transfer of control has occurred. Contract assets are typically related to subscription  and  hosted  service  contracts  where  the  transaction  price  allocated  to  the  satisfied  performance  obligations  ex ceeds  the  value  of  billings  to  date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2024 and 2023. Contract assets were $248 million and $141 million as of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, respectively.\n\n## Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits.  Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced for these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The deferred  revenue  balance  is  influenced  by  several  factors,  including  the  compounding  effects  of  renewals,  invoice  duration,  invoice  timing,  size  and  new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, the balance of deferred revenue was $6.26 billion, which includes $83 million of refundable customer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation right for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time of cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services. Non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds related to these agreements comprised approximately 4% of the total deferred revenue.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## ADOBE INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)",

We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates prov ided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and serv ices separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relativ e SSP of the v arious products and serv ices.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observ able, such as when we do not sell the product or serv ice separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observ able inputs. We typically hav e more than one SSP for indiv idual products and serv ices due to the stratification of those products and serv ices by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the v arious benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of deliv ery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may prov ide other credits or incentiv es, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and serv ices, which are accounted for as v ariable consideration when determining the amount of rev enue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes av ailable. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming of rev enue recognition may differ from the timing of inv oicing to customers. We record a receiv able when rev enue is recognized prior to inv oicing, or unearned rev enue when rev enue is recognized subsequent to inv oicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally inv oice customers annually at the beginning of each annual cov erage period. We record a receiv able related to rev enue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we hav e an unconditional right to inv oice and receiv e payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned rev enue related to v olume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud serv ices. Unearned rev enue is generally inv oiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably ov er the cov erage period. Unearned rev enue also includes payments for consulting serv ices to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-deliv ery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we hav e been paid in adv ance and earn the rev enue when we transfer control of the product or serv ice.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Rev enue for further information, including unearned rev enue by segment and changes in unearned rev enue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions v ary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of rev enue recognition differs from the timing of inv oicing, we hav e determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our inv oicing terms is to prov ide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and serv ices, not to receiv e financing from our customers or to prov ide customers with financing. Examples include inv oicing at the beginning of a subscription term with rev enue recognized ratably ov er the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are inv oiced annually with rev enue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, long-term accounts receiv able, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectiv ely, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receiv able balance.

      "answer": "Cisco (CSCO) highlights that cash from operations may fluctuate due to shipment linearity, accounts receivable timing, and inventory management, and emphasizes its intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Microsoft (MSFT) reports $89.0 billion in cash from operations for fiscal 2022, which it uses to fund dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, and capital expenditures, indicating robust cash generation and deployment across multiple fronts. Qualcomm (QCOM) notes that cash from operations is a key source of liquidity for its strategic initiatives, though it does not quantify this as explicitly as Microsoft. When synthesized, the disclosures show that while all three rely on operating cash flows for capital deployment, Microsoft demonstrates the highest operational cash generation and most diversified use of funds, while Qualcomm provides the least specific detail on operational cash usage.",

Equity  investments  were  $6.9  billion  and  $6.0  billion  as  of  June  30,  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  Our  short-term investments  are  primarily  intended  to  facilitate  liquidity  and  capital  preservation.  They  consist  predominantly  of  highly  liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed  to  achieve  economic  returns  that  correlate  to  certain  fixed-income  indices.  The  settlement  risk  related  to  these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\n\n## Valuation\n\nIn  general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value  of  our  financial  instruments.  This  pricing  methodology  applies  to  our  Level  1  investments,  such  as  U.S.  government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices  that  are  observable  either  directly  or  indirectly.  This  pricing  methodology  applies  to  our  Level  2  investments,  such  as commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  U.S.  agency  securities,  foreign  government  bonds,  mortgage-  and  asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with  unobservable  inputs. Assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis  using  unobservable  inputs  are  an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\n\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either  provide  a  quoted  market  price  in  an  active  market  or  use  observable  inputs  for  their  pricing  without  applying  significant adjustments.  Broker  pricing  is  used  mainly  when  a  quoted  price  is  not  available,  the  investment  is  not  priced  by  our  pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nCash from operations increased $12.3 billion to $89.0 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. Cash used in financing increased $10.4 billion to $58.9 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $5.3 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $5.3 billion increase in repayments of debt. Cash used in investing increased $2.7 billion to $30.3 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $13.1 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $3.3 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, offset in part by a $15.6 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.",

AMD similarly notes that OECD-led initiatives such as Pillar Two could significantly affect its tax provision and net income, particularly in jurisdictions where it operates. ORCL provides a more general statement, noting that its effective tax rate is influenced by the mix of income across jurisdictions and could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in tax laws or rulings. Together, these perspectives reveal that while ADBE and AMD are acutely aware of and specifically exposed to new global tax frameworks, ORCL appears less detailed in its risk assessment, suggesting a potentially different sensitivity or preparedness to these regulatory shifts.",

Determining whether a cybersecurity incident is notifiable or reportable may not be straightforward and any such mandatory disclosures could be costly and lead to negative publicity, loss of customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, diversion of management's attention and governmental investigations.\n\nWhile we have invested in readiness to comply with applicable requirements, the dynamic and evolving nature of these laws, regulations and codes, as well as their interpretation by regulators and courts, may affect our ability (and our enterprise customers' ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction and deletion of their personal information), to implement our business models effectively and to adequately address disclosure requirements. These laws, regulations and codes may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (for example, AI and machine learning) and may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. Perception of our practices, products, services or solutions, even if unfounded, as a violation of individual privacy, data protection rights or cybersecurity requirements, subjects us to public criticism, lawsuits, investigations, claims and other proceedings by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and reputation and expose us to increased liability, fines and other punitive measures including prohibition on sales of our products, services or solutions, restrictive judicial orders and disgorgement of data. Additionally, we collect and store information on behalf of our business customers and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us.\n\n## Our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.\n\nOur  patents,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  copyrights  and  other  intellectual  property  are  valuable  assets  to  us.  Infringement  or  misappropriation  of  such intellectual property could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value. We protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the United States and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures and contractual restrictions. Despite our efforts, protecting our intellectual property rights and preventing unauthorized use of our intellectual property are inherently difficult. For instance, we actively combat software piracy, but we continue to lose revenue due to illegal use of our software. Third parties may illegally copy and sell counterfeit versions of our products. To the extent counterfeit installations and sales replace otherwise legitimate ones, our operating results could be adversely affected. We apply for patents in the United States and in foreign countries, but we are not always successful in obtaining patent protection or in obtaining such protection timely to meet our business needs. Our patents may be invalidated or circumvented. Moreover, due to challenges in detecting patent infringement pertaining to generative AI technologies, it may be more difficult to protect our generative AI and related innovations with patents. Additionally, if we use generative AI in the creation of our source code, we may not be able to rely on copyright to protect such intellectual property. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not provide the same level of intellectual property protection as U.S. laws and courts and could fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack or otherwise, we could lose future trade secret protection for that source code. Such loss could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying, use, or other misappropriation, our business could be harmed.\n\n## Changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretations thereof may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our current provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. Tax  laws in the United States as well as other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business are subject to change as new laws are passed and/or new interpretations are made available, which may have a material impact on our business. These countries, governmental bodies, such as the European Commission of the European Union, and intergovernmental economic organizations, such as the Organization for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development,  have  made  or  could  make  unprecedented  assertions  about  how  taxation  is  determined  and,  in  some  cases,  have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been interpreted and applied.\n\nChanges in our operating landscape, such as changes in laws or interpretations of tax rules, could adversely affect our effective tax rates and/or cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Our future effective tax rates are likely to be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax  rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits. An increase in our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability.",

The limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.\n\nOur business is subject to potential tax liabilities, and exposure to greater-than-anticipated income tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax rules  and  regulations,  changes  in  interpretation  of  tax  rules   and  regulations ,  or  unfavorable  as s es s ments   from  tax  audits ,  could  affect  our effective tax rates , financial condition, and res ults  of operations .\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide prov ision for income taxes. T ax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws could hav e a material adv erse effect on our tax obligations and effectiv e tax rate. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, changes to our corporate operating structure, intercompany arrangements, and tax planning strategies.\n\nOur income tax expense is computed based on tax rates enacted at the time of the respectiv e financial period. Our future effectiv e tax rates, financial condition and results from operations could be unfav orably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in  the  tax  rules  and  regulations  or  the  interpretation  of  tax  rules  and  regulations  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  do  business  or  by  changes  in  the valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets.  Many  countries  hav e  implemented  legislation  and  other  guidance  to  align  their  international  tax  rules  with  the Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Dev elopment's  (OECD)  Base  Erosion  and  Profit  Shifting  recommendations  and  action  plan  that  aim  to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentiv e practices. T he OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely 'Pillar One' and 'Pillar Two'). Many countries we do business in have implemented laws based on Pillar Two, which may materially adv ersely impact our prov ision for income taxes, net income and cash flows. As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to rev iew and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or existing tax rulings, and may hav e a material adv erse effect on us.\n\nIn  addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our prov ision for income taxes and hav e reserv ed for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not hav e an adverse effect on our effectiv e tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIn  the  ordinary  course  of  our  business,  there  are  many  transactions  and  calculations  where  the  ultimate  income  tax,  indirect  tax,  or  other  tax determination is uncertain. Although we believ e our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits or litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax prov isions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adv erse effect on our cash, tax prov isions and results of operations in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\n\nWe are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.\n\nFrom time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in v arious legal actions, as described in Note 18 - Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, we hav e been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate gov ernance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. On occasion, we receiv e claims that indiv iduals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities  and  that  this  alleged  exposure  caused  harm.  Litigation  can  inv olv e  complex  factual  and  legal  questions,  and  its  outcome  is uncertain.  It  is  possible  that  if  a  claim  is  successfully  asserted  against  us,  it  could  result  in  the  payment  of  damages  that  could  be  material  to  our business.",

      "answer": "Apple reported SG&A expenses of $26.1 billion in 2024, representing 7% of total net sales, consistent with the prior year. Broadcom disclosed SG&A expenses of $1,546 million in fiscal 2024, which is significantly lower in absolute terms but must be viewed relative to its revenue base. NVIDIA indicated that its sales, general, and administrative expenses were 2.7% of revenue in fiscal 2025 (year ended January 26, 2025), showing a decline from 4.4% in the prior year. This suggests that NVIDIA is reducing its SG&A intensity relative to revenue growth, while Apple maintains a steady proportion, and Broadcom operates with a lower absolute expense base that may reflect different business models or operational efficiencies.",

Microsoft indicated a smaller impact, with the FDII deduction lowering its effective tax rate by 1.1% in the same period. NVIDIA, while not providing a specific percentage, noted that the FDII deduction was a contributing factor in lowering its effective tax rate below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, alongside benefits from lower-tax jurisdictions and stock-based compensation. These differences suggest varied reliance on foreign-derived intangible income and distinct international tax planning strategies across the three firms.",

          "chunk_text": "## NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nincrease in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and the discrete benefit of the Domestication. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\n\nOn June 28, 2021, we simplified our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. IP to the United States via domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. The Domestication more closely aligns our corporate structure to our operating structure in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting conclusions and changes to U.S. and European tax laws. The impact of  the  Domestication,  which  is  regarded  as  a  change  in  tax  status,  resulted  in  a  discrete  benefit  primarily  from  revaluing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $244 million in fiscal year 2022.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.\n\nOur  effective  tax  rates  for  fiscal  years  2021  and  2020  were  lower  than  the  U.S.  federal  statutory  rate  of  21%  due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the  U.S.  federal  statutory  tax  rate,  recognition  of  U.S.  federal  research  tax  credits,  and  excess  tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.05 billion and $232 million of cumulative undistributed  earnings  held  by  certain  subsidiaries  in  Israel  and  the  United  Kingdom,  respectively.  We  have  not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\n\nAs  of  January  30,  2022  and  January  31,  2021,  we  had  a  valuation  allowance  of  $907  million  and  $728  million, respectively, related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $397 million, $345 million and $341 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $341 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 30, 2022, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $102 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2042. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.24 billion, of which $1.18 billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $55 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for  changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization  of  federal,  state,  and  foreign  net  operating  losses  and  tax  credit  carryforwards  may  also  be  subject  to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign  tax  provisions.  If  any  such  limitations  apply,  the  federal,  state,  or  foreign  net  operating  loss  and  tax  credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had $1.01 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $808 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, $181 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $808 million of net unrecognized tax benefits as of January 30, 2022 consisted of $670 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $138 million reflected as a net reduction to the deferred tax assets.",

          "chunk_text": "Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire, and these risks may be magnified by the size and number of transactions we have executed. Ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management's attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. The loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners of businesses we acquire may adversely impact the value of the assets, operations or businesses. Furthermore, acquisitions or joint ventures may result in significant costs and expenses, including those related to retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay, early retirement costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairment charges, enhancing controls, procedures and policies including those related to financial reporting, disclosure, and cyber and information security, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively affect our profitability as these costs and expenses grow along with the increased capital invested in such acquisitions and joint ventures. We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions.\n\nWe might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition, investment or joint venture we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company's known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties. In addition, we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities, or from an acquisition's controls related to financial reporting, disclosure, and cyber and information security environment. The number of transactions we execute annually may increase this risk. If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected regulatory or legal exposure, including litigation with new or existing clients, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our relationships with clients and our business. In addition, we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which we have made minority investments or in which we have acquired less than 100% of the equity. This lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. Litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses. For example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing working capital adjustments. Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of investments for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.\n\nWe also periodically evaluate, and have engaged in, the disposition of assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and people, the diversion of management's attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.\n\nWe are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, ecosystem partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. Regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert management's attention and resources. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, fines, penalties, debarment or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.\n\nWe could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control or other deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, ecosystem",

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and particularly in Item 1: 'Business,' Item 1A: 'Risk Factors,' Item 3: 'Legal Proceedings' and Item 7: 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These statements are indicated by words or phrases such as 'anticipate,' 'expect,' 'estimate,' 'seek,' 'plan,' 'believe,' 'could,' 'intend,' 'will,' and similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements may include projections of financial information; statements about historical results that may suggest trends for our business; statements of the plans, strategies, and objectives of management for future operations; statements of expectation or belief regarding future events (including any acquisitions we may make), technology developments, our products, product sales, expenses, liquidity, cash flow and growth rates, or enforceability of our intellectual property rights; any backlog; and the effects of seasonality on our business. Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections of our industry performance and macroeconomic conditions, based on management's judgment, beliefs, current trends and market conditions, and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We derive most of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Accordingly, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are summarized and disclosed under 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nUnless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Broadcom,' 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' mean Broadcom Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52week year and the first Sunday in November in a 53-week year. We refer to our fiscal years by the calendar year in which they end. For example, the fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 was a 52-week year.",

          "chunk_text": "## NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months  are  included  in  operating  lease  assets,  accrued  and  other  current  liabilities,  and  long-term  operating  lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\n\nOperating  lease  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  based  on  the  present  value  of  the  remaining  lease  payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential  impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\n\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.\n\nOur quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited  to,  prospective  financial  information,  growth  rates,  residual  values,  discount  rates  and  comparable  multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\n\n## Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&amp;D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise  used  up  or,  if  that  pattern  cannot  be  reliably  determined,  using  a  straight-line  amortization  method.  We initially  capitalize  the  fair  value  of  IPR&amp;D  as  an  intangible  asset  with  an  indefinite  life.  When  IPR&amp;D  projects  are completed,  we  reclassify  the  IPR&amp;D  as  an  amortizable  purchased  intangible  asset  and  amortize  over  the  asset's estimated useful life.\n\nLong-lived  assets,  such  as  property  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  subject  to  amortization,  are  reviewed  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\n\n## Business Combination\n\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&amp;D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions  are  inherently  uncertain  and  subject  to  refinement.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  used  in  valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used",

Intel mentions that share-based compensation expense is excluded from its long-term gross margin outlook on a non-GAAP basis, suggesting that the company views this expense as a structural cost that is managed separately from core operational performance metrics.

We elected the practical expedient to report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions.\n\n## Employee Share-Based Compensation Arrangements\n\nShare-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards expected to ultimately vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs from previous estimates.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We establish liabilities or reduce assets when we believe tax positions are not more likely than not of being sustained if challenged. Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Each fiscal quarter, we evaluate tax positions and adjust the related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. We release stranded tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items.\n\n## Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts\n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense items are translated at average foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses arising from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, including certificates of deposit and time deposits. As a result of certain subsidiaries' cash management systems, checks issued but not presented to the banks for payment may create negative book cash balances. Such negative balances are classified as Current portion of long term debt and bank borrowings.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses-Client Receivables and Contract Assets\n\nWe record client receivables and contract assets at their face amounts less an allowance for credit losses. The allowance represents our estimate of expected credit losses based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information. As of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the total allowances recorded for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $25,786 and $32,206, respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets.\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\nOur financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments and client receivables, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited.",

      "question": "How do AAPL, INTC, and QCOM each disclose or treat share-based compensation expense in their financial reporting, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to accounting transparency and performance measurement?",
      "answer": "AAPL provides a detailed table showing its share-based compensation expense for 2022, 2021, and 2020, indicating a structured and transparent approach to reporting this expense within its consolidated statements of operations. In contrast, INTC excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP financial measures, which are used in performance-based RSUs and annual cash bonus plans, signaling a strategic emphasis on adjusting for this cost to better reflect operational performance. QCOM also reports its share-based compensation expense explicitly, breaking down the components of total share-based compensation in its consolidated financial statements, showing a level of granular disclosure similar to AAPL but with a focus on all share-based awards collectively. Together, these disclosures suggest that while AAPL and QCOM emphasize transparency in reporting share-based compensation, INTC treats it as an adjustment to better align financial metrics with performance incentives, reflecting a more strategic, internal use of the metric.",

          "chunk_text": "that have been agreed upon, our anticipated cash requirements may increase, our strategy, business and financial results may be adversely affected, and we may be constrained in our ability to engage in transactions that are in the best interests of our stockholders.\n\n## Changes in product demand and margins can adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM  to grow over time, driven by factors such as a larger installed base, demand for A I capabilities, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize, or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products have in the past and may in the future reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.\n\nImportant factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:\n\n- business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;\n- consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n- customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as the shift in data center spend to GPUs to support A I workloads;\n- geopolitical conditions, including trade policies, potential tariffs or other trade restrictions, and geopolitical tensions and conflicts;\n- our ability  to timely  introduce competitiv e products;\n- competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;\n- the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;\n- customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and\n- disruptions affecting customers, such as the delays in obtaining tools, components, and other supplies as a result of COV ID-19-related port shutdowns in China that negatively impacted demand for our business in 2022, as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021.\n\nOur pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our core product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms to higher-end platforms. Our ancillary product offerings that extend beyond our core product lines typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced products, and at times are not profitable. Some of our higher-priced products, however, such as the Intel Core Ultra 200V  processors launched in September 2024, have lower margins as they are produced at external foundries rather than in our manufacturing facilities. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-margin to lower-margin products in any of our market segments, as has been the case with the Intel Core Ultra 200V  processors, our gross margin percentage has decreased and may decrease again.\n\n## Macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including changes to trade policies and regulations, present significant risks to us in many jurisdictions.\n\nWe have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&amp;D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Our operations rely upon a supply chain that is also highly distributed, and with reliance in some instances on supplies or materials available in only one or more geographic areas. M oreover, sales outside the US accounted for 76% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, with revenue from billings to China contributing 29% of our total revenue. A s a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to execute our business strategy, manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.\n\nAdverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth; changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy; high interest rates; tighter credit; inflation; lower capital ex penditures by  businesses, including on IT infrastructure; increases in unemployment; and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. A n economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to: increased credit and collectability risks; higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets; reduced liquidity; adverse impacts on our suppliers; failures of counterparties, including financial institutions and insurers; asset impairments; and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\n\nTrade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. They can also result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term",

      "question": "How do AVGO, CSCO, and ORCL each compare in terms of their cash paid for income taxes in fiscal year 2023, and what might this reveal about their respective tax strategies or geographic revenue mix?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2023, AVGO paid $1,782 million in cash for income taxes, CSCO paid $3,571 million, and ORCL paid $3,009 million. These figures suggest differences in tax exposure among the companies, potentially reflecting variations in geographic revenue distribution, tax planning strategies, or profitability structures. CSCO had the highest cash tax payment, which may indicate higher earnings in jurisdictions with elevated tax rates or less tax deferral. ORCL\u2019s tax payment was lower than CSCO\u2019s but higher than AVGO\u2019s, aligning with its broader mix of on-premise and cloud revenue. AVGO\u2019s significantly lower cash tax payment could reflect the impact of its recent acquisitions, which may have included tax-efficient structures or offshore earnings.",

      "answer": "AVGO emphasizes automation across enterprise applications and systems, particularly through AI-driven operations (AIOps), DevOps, and ValueOps, which reduce manual effort and improve scheduling, tracking, and lifecycle management of work. MSFT highlights cost efficiency through economies of scale in its cloud infrastructure, including coordinated datacenters, multi-tenancy, and hybrid consistency, which reduce per-unit computational costs and maintenance labor. ORCL focuses on Oracle Autonomous Database, which automates database administration tasks like tuning, patching, and scaling, and uses consumption-based pricing to lower costs by charging only for resources used. Together, these companies demonstrate distinct but complementary strategies\u2014AVGO through enterprise automation, MSFT through scalable cloud infrastructure, and ORCL through autonomous, consumption-based database services\u2014all aimed at improving cost efficiency.",

For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. Microsoft has a proven track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets.\n\nWe continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration across the technology stack while offering  openness,  improving  time  to  value,  reducing  costs,  and  increasing  agility.  Being  a  global-scale  cloud, Azure  uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance.

We  also  offer  Oracle  Database  as  a  cloud  service,  such  as  with  OCI's Exadata Cloud Service and Database Cloud Service.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Oracle  Database,  we  offer  a  portfolio  of  specialized  databases  to  address  specific  customer  requirements including MySQL, the world's most popular open source database, as a cloud service and an on-premise offering.\n\n## Oracle Autonomous Database\n\nOracle Autonomous  Database  is  designed  to  deliver  performance  and  scale  for  enterprise  database  workloads  with  automated database operations and policy-driven optimization by combining certain Oracle infrastructure technologies including the Oracle Database, Oracle's Next-Generation Cloud Infrastructure, Oracle Exadata, and native machine learning capabilities, among others. Oracle  Autonomous  Database  is  designed  to  be  self-driving,  automating  routine  database  administration  tasks  including maintenance, tuning, patching, security and backup. Oracle Autonomous Database is engineered to lower labor costs and reduce human error  while  using  machine  learning-driven  diagnostics  for  fault  prediction  and  error  handling  and  is  also  engineered  to provide  automatic  threat  detection  and  remediation.  Oracle Autonomous  Database  is  designed  to  enable  on-demand,  automatic scaling of database resources combined with consumption-based pricing in order to help organizations lower costs by paying only for resources used. The integration of Oracle Autonomous Database with other Oracle Cloud Services, such as Java Cloud and the Oracle APEX low-code service, along with open interfaces and integrations, is designed to provide developers with a modern, open platform to develop new and innovative applications.\n\nFor  analytics  workloads,  Oracle  Autonomous  Database  is  designed  to  provide  customers  with  easy-to-use  analytics  tools  and machine learning capabilities that are accelerated using Oracle Exadata's scale-out infrastructure. We believe Oracle Autonomous Database's built-in developer capabilities and automation will enable organizations to:\n\n- quickly deploy new data marts and data warehouses;\n- move existing ones to the cloud; and\n- create data lake houses.\n\nAll of which is designed to enable organizations to gain new insights into customer behavior, more accurately anticipate future demand, align workforce deployment with business activity forecasts and accelerate the pace of operations, among other benefits. For transaction processing workloads, Oracle Autonomous Database is designed to enable organizations to safely run a complex mix of high-performance transactions. It is also designed to enable organizations to efficiently support dynamic workloads, conduct real-time analysis of transactional data and lower administration costs.\n\nOracle Autonomous Database offers the following options, among others:\n\n- Shared  Exadata  Cloud  Infrastructure,  which  is  designed  to  provide  a  simple  and  elastic  deployment  choice  in  OCI regions where Oracle autonomously operates all aspects of the database lifecycle, including database placement, backup and software updates;\n- Dedicated  Exadata  Cloud  Infrastructure,  which  is  designed  to  provide  dedicated  compute,  storage,  networking  and database  resources  for  a  single  tenant  in  OCI  regions,  enabling  high  levels  of  security  isolation  and  governance, customizable operational policies for autonomous operations, workload placement and optimization, availability, overprovisioning and peak usage; and\n- Exadata  Cloud@Customer  Infrastructure,  which  is  designed  to  be  deployed  in  customer  data  centers  to  provide  the characteristics of a private, on-premise cloud but with cloud automation, consumption pricing, and Oracle management of the infrastructure and software.",

      "question": "How do AAPL, ADBE, and CSCO each characterize the growth or decline in their Americas revenue in 2023, and what does this reveal about regional market dynamics affecting their respective business models?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AAPL experienced a 3% decline in its Americas revenue to $162.56 billion, indicating a slight contraction in its core market. ADBE, on the other hand, saw its Total Americas revenue grow by approximately 13.7% to $11.65 billion, signaling strong demand for its software solutions in the region. CSCO reported a decrease in Americas revenue to $33.45 billion from $31.97 billion in the following year, showing a weakening trend in its networking hardware business in the Americas. Together, these trends suggest that while the broader IT sector faced mixed performance in the Americas, growth was concentrated in software (as seen with ADBE), while hardware and infrastructure vendors (like AAPL and CSCO) experienced stagnation or decline.",

      "answer": "Apple highlights that its effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings across countries with differing statutory tax rates, valuation of deferred tax assets, and evolving international tax laws, including OECD proposals like the global minimum tax. AMD specifically notes that the implementation of Pillar Two-based laws in jurisdictions where it operates may materially impact its provision for income taxes, net income, and cash flows, and that its deferred tax assets could face limitations under U.S. tax code sections. Oracle states that its effective tax rates are influenced by the geographic distribution of income across jurisdictions with varying tax rates and could be adversely affected by unfavorable shifts in earnings toward higher-tax jurisdictions or changes in tax laws, including international reforms. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to global tax shifts, Apple emphasizes geographic earnings mix and valuation risks, AMD underscores regulatory changes like Pillar Two, and Oracle focuses on jurisdictional income distribution and statutory rate alignment.",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.\n\nConversely , a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally , strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any , or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity , credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk,  sov ereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. A s a result, the value and liquidity of the  Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially . A lthough the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A  substantial majority of the  Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company's exposure to credit and collectibility  risk on its trade receiv ables is higher in certain international markets and its ability  to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company . In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. A s of September 28, 2024, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in A sia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\n## The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.",

The limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.\n\nOur business is subject to potential tax liabilities, and exposure to greater-than-anticipated income tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax rules  and  regulations,  changes  in  interpretation  of  tax  rules   and  regulations ,  or  unfavorable  as s es s ments   from  tax  audits ,  could  affect  our effective tax rates , financial condition, and res ults  of operations .\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide prov ision for income taxes. T ax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws could hav e a material adv erse effect on our tax obligations and effectiv e tax rate. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, changes to our corporate operating structure, intercompany arrangements, and tax planning strategies.\n\nOur income tax expense is computed based on tax rates enacted at the time of the respectiv e financial period. Our future effectiv e tax rates, financial condition and results from operations could be unfav orably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in  the  tax  rules  and  regulations  or  the  interpretation  of  tax  rules  and  regulations  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  do  business  or  by  changes  in  the valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets.  Many  countries  hav e  implemented  legislation  and  other  guidance  to  align  their  international  tax  rules  with  the Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Dev elopment's  (OECD)  Base  Erosion  and  Profit  Shifting  recommendations  and  action  plan  that  aim  to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentiv e practices. T he OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely 'Pillar One' and 'Pillar Two'). Many countries we do business in have implemented laws based on Pillar Two, which may materially adv ersely impact our prov ision for income taxes, net income and cash flows. As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to rev iew and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or existing tax rulings, and may hav e a material adv erse effect on us.\n\nIn  addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our prov ision for income taxes and hav e reserv ed for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not hav e an adverse effect on our effectiv e tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIn  the  ordinary  course  of  our  business,  there  are  many  transactions  and  calculations  where  the  ultimate  income  tax,  indirect  tax,  or  other  tax determination is uncertain. Although we believ e our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits or litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax prov isions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adv erse effect on our cash, tax prov isions and results of operations in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\n\nWe are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.\n\nFrom time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in v arious legal actions, as described in Note 18 - Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, we hav e been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate gov ernance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. On occasion, we receiv e claims that indiv iduals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities  and  that  this  alleged  exposure  caused  harm.  Litigation  can  inv olv e  complex  factual  and  legal  questions,  and  its  outcome  is uncertain.  It  is  possible  that  if  a  claim  is  successfully  asserted  against  us,  it  could  result  in  the  payment  of  damages  that  could  be  material  to  our business.",

ORCL has significantly larger foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1.9 billion, with approximately $1.9 billion not subject to expiration and only $68 million set to expire between fiscal 2025 and 2044. QCOM has the largest foreign net operating loss carryforwards at $2.6 billion, with substantially all of these losses being carried forward indefinitely.

      "answer": "Cisco (CSCO) emphasizes a large, global sales force of approximately 26,000 employees and a hybrid direct-and-channel sales model, indicating a high-touch, relationship-driven go-to-market approach. Oracle (ORCL) reports $7,054 million in sales and marketing expenses for its cloud and license segment, reflecting a significant investment in driving enterprise software and cloud adoption. Qualcomm (QCOM) notes a $32 million increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2022, signaling a measured, incremental investment likely tied to product launches or market expansion. Together, these figures reveal differing strategic emphases: Cisco prioritizes a broad and deep sales infrastructure, Oracle allocates heavily to drive cloud growth, and Qualcomm takes a more restrained approach, aligning with its semiconductor and licensing business model.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Customers and Markets\n\nMany  factors  influence  the  IT,  collaboration,  and  networking  requirements  of  our  customers.  These  include  the  size  of  the organization,  number  and  types  of  technology  systems,  geographic  location,  and  business  applications  deployed  throughout  the customer's  network.  Our  customer  base  is  not  limited  to  any  specific  industry,  geography,  or  market  segment.  Our  customers primarily operate in the following markets: enterprise, commercial, service provider, and public sector.\n\n## Enterprise\n\nEnterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multivendor environment. We offer service and support packages,  financing,  and  managed  network  services,  primarily  through  our  service  provider  partners.  We  sell  these  products through  a  network  of  third-party  application  and  technology  vendors  and  channel  partners,  as  well  as  selling  directly  to  these customers.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe  commercial  market  represents  larger,  or  midmarket  and  small  businesses.  We  sell  to  our  midmarket  customers  through  a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with less complexity. Small businesses require information technologies and communications products  that  are  easy  to  configure,  install,  and  maintain.  We  sell  to  these  smaller  organizations  within  the  commercial  market primarily through channel partners.\n\n## Service Providers\n\nService  providers  offer  data,  voice,  video,  and  mobile/wireless  services  to  businesses,  governments,  utilities,  and  consumers worldwide. The service provider market includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers, webscale operators as well as  Internet,  cable,  and  wireless  providers.  We  also  include  media,  broadcast,  and  content  providers  within  our  service  provider market,  as  the  lines  in  the  telecommunications  industry  continue  to  blur  between  traditional  network-based,  content-based  and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or Internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach.\n\n## Public Sector\n\nThe public sector market includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers. Many public sector customers have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector customers through a network of third-party application and technology vendors, channel partners, as well as through direct sales.\n\n## Sales Overview\n\nAs of the end of fiscal 2022, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 26,000 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Channel  partners  include  systems  integrators,  service  providers,  other resellers, and distributors.\n\nSystems  integrators  and  service  providers  typically  sell  directly  to  end  users  and  often  provide  system  installation,  technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators.\n\nDistributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-in method. These distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.\n\nFor  information  regarding  risks  related  to  our  sales  channels,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  including  the  risk  factors  entitled 'Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins' and 'Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.'\n\nFor  information  regarding  risks  relating  to  our  international  operations,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  including  the  risk  factors entitled 'Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain",

      "question": "How do Accenture (ACN), Broadcom (AVGO), and Oracle (ORCL) each characterize the portion of their remaining performance obligations that is expected to translate into recognized revenue, and what does this reveal about their revenue visibility and contract structures?",
      "answer": "Accenture notes that only the non-cancelable portion of contracts is included in remaining performance obligations, with a significant portion of contract bookings excluded due to short-notice termination rights. Broadcom reports $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations as of November 3, 2024, with approximately 43% expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Oracle provides forward-looking expectations about the percentages of remaining performance obligations that will be recognized as revenue over future periods, though specific figures are not disclosed. This reveals that Broadcom has the most concrete revenue visibility due to its large committed obligations, while Accenture and Oracle face more uncertainty due to contract flexibility and variable recognition timing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ACN \u2192 Remaining Performance Obligations: Accenture specifies that only the non-cancelable portion of contracts is included in remaining performance obligations, with many contracts terminable on short notice, resulting in significant contract bookings not being captured in this metric.",
        "Hop 2: AVGO \u2192 Remaining Performance Obligations: Broadcom discloses $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations as of November 3, 2024, with approximately 43% expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, indicating a high level of revenue visibility for this portion of the business.",
        "Hop 3: ORCL \u2192 Remaining Performance Obligations: Oracle discusses expectations regarding the percentages of remaining performance obligations that will be recognized as revenue over future periods, but does not provide exact figures, suggesting a forward-looking but less quantitatively transparent approach."

      "question": "How do Apple, Adobe, and Cisco differ in their reporting of aggregate fair value for unvested equity awards, and what do these differences suggest about their respective equity compensation strategies?",
      "answer": "Apple reports an aggregate fair value of $30,312 million for unvested RSUs as of September 24, 2022, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $109.48 per RSU. Adobe reports an aggregate fair value of $358 million for outstanding equity awards as of the end of its fiscal year, with a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 1.04 years, and $333 million for awards expected to vest. Cisco reports aggregate fair values of $1,979 million for unvested stock units as of July 31, 2022, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $46.67 per share. These differences suggest Apple has a significantly larger equity compensation exposure by value compared to Adobe and Cisco, with Adobe focusing on shorter-duration awards and Cisco maintaining a more moderate and stable fair value over time.",

      "answer": "AVGO declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share on December 10, 2024, payable on December 31, 2024, indicating a consistent return to shareholders following its VMware merger restructuring. ORCL, in contrast, paid a full-year dividend of $1.60 per share in fiscal 2024, with a final quarterly installment of $0.40 per share paid in July 2024, showing a more mature and predictable dividend policy. QCOM announced a $0.85 per share dividend in October 2024, payable in December, suggesting a strategic effort to maintain or increase shareholder returns amid evolving market conditions. These differences highlight varying capital allocation strategies: AVGO balancing post-merger integration with shareholder returns, ORCL maintaining a steady and substantial dividend commitment, and QCOM signaling confidence in its cash flow stability despite industry headwinds.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## I ndex to Financial Statements\n\n## Recent Financing Activities :\n\nTerm Loan Credit Agreements : On June 10, 2024, we terminated our existing term loan credit agreement that we entered into in fiscal 2023 and repaid the principal amount outstanding together with interest accrued up to the date of repayment. Simultaneously, we borrowed up to the maximum commitment amount of $5.6 billion pursuant to a term loan credit agreement (Term Loan Credit Agreement) executed on the same date. Any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will become fully due and payable on August 16, 2027, unless the termination date of Term Loan Credit Agreement is extended. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our borrowings.\n\nCash Dividends : In fiscal 2024, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.60 per share that totaled $4.4 billion. In June 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 25, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 11, 2024. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\n\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program : Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of May 31, 2024, approximately $7.0 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 10.6 million shares for $1.2 billion, 17.0 million shares for $1.3 billion, and 185.8 million shares for $16.2 billion in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\n\nContractual Obligations : Our largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2024 consisted of:\n\n\u00b7 principal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that were included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic i nterest payments;\n\n- routine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that were included in our consolidated balance sheet;\n- operating lease liabilities that were included in our consolidated balance sheet;\n- operating lease commitments that have not yet commenced and were not included in our consolidated balance sheet; and\n- other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.\n\nIn addition, as of May 31, 2024, we had $11.0 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2025. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are i nherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many aspects are out of our control. Notes 7, 10, 13 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report include additional i nformation regarding our most material contractual obligations and contingencies.\n\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, and our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.",

These differences suggest varying scales of operations and potentially different credit policies or customer payment terms. Apple's significantly higher balance reflects its large global sales volume, while NVIDIA's increase from $9,999 million to $23,065 million indicates substantial growth in sales and possibly extended payment terms. Qualcomm's much smaller balance suggests either a more conservative credit policy or a business model with faster cash collections.",

      "question": "How do Accenture (ACN), Intel (INTC), and Oracle (ORCL) each address the impact of macroeconomic and regulatory factors on their future revenue, and what does this reveal about their respective sensitivities to global economic conditions?",
      "answer": "Accenture (ACN) highlights that shifting economic, social, and political conditions, including changes in tax laws and foreign currency exchange rates, could materially adversely affect their future revenue. Specifically, the firm notes that unfavorable currency fluctuations have already had an adverse effect and could continue to do so. Intel (INTC) acknowledges that macroeconomic conditions, including geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts (e.g., U.S.-China, Russia-Ukraine), are key uncertainties that could materially affect its future revenue and financial performance. Oracle (ORCL), while not explicitly referencing macroeconomic risks, provides a multi-year revenue forecast showing declining growth rates from $2,303 million in fiscal 2025 to $561 million by fiscal 2029, suggesting a potential moderation in revenue growth without direct commentary on external economic pressures. Together, this indicates that while ACN and INTC are explicitly sensitive to macroeconomic and regulatory volatility, ORCL's forward-looking revenue disclosures reflect a more internalized or stable growth trajectory.",

      "answer": "ADbe reports unbilled receivables of $80 million as part of its trade receivables, indicating these are typically related to license revenue or services delivered prior to invoicing. AMD includes unbilled receivables primarily from work completed on development services and custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders, all expected to be billed and collected within twelve months. CSCO references unbilled receivables in the context of past-due financing receivables, where unbilled amounts within a contract are included in aging classifications. ADBE and AMD both emphasize that unbilled receivables are closely tied to performance obligations and are managed with credit risk assessments, while CSCO integrates unbilled receivables into its broader credit loss allowance framework. This reveals that while all three companies recognize unbilled receivables, they differ in how they categorize, disclose, and manage the associated credit risks.",

      "question": "How do Salesforce (CRM), Cisco (CSCO), and Microsoft (MSFT) compare in terms of their Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) as a percentage of total stockholders' equity, and what might this reveal about their respective exposure to foreign currency translation adjustments and other comprehensive income risks?",
      "answer": "Salesforce (CRM) reported an Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) of $266 million as of January 31, 2025, which represents approximately 0.44% of its total stockholders' equity of $61,173 million. Cisco (CSCO) had an AOCL of $1,430 million as of July 27, 2024, accounting for about 3.15% of its total stockholders' equity of $45,457 million. Microsoft (MSFT) disclosed an AOCL of $5,590 million as of June 30, 2024, which equates to roughly 2.08% of its total stockholders' equity of $268,477 million. This comparison suggests that Cisco has the highest proportional exposure to comprehensive loss, potentially indicating greater sensitivity to foreign exchange fluctuations or other market-driven adjustments, while Salesforce maintains the lowest exposure, signaling relatively more stability in its comprehensive income position.",

        "Hop 1: CRM \u2192 Comprehensive Loss: Salesforce reports Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) of $266 million, a small fraction of its $61,173 million total stockholders' equity.",

      "question": "How do Apple (AAPL), Accenture (ACN), and Oracle (ORCL) each report changes in their 'Other Non-Current Assets' in fiscal year 2024 compared to 2023, and what might these changes suggest about their respective investment strategies or asset management approaches?",
      "answer": "Apple reported an increase in Other Non-Current Assets from $46.9 billion in 2023 to $55.3 billion in 2024, suggesting a significant strategic allocation or acquisition of long-term non-core assets. Accenture, in contrast, experienced a decline in this category from $44.7 billion in 2023 to $28.4 billion in 2024, indicating a potential divestiture or reclassification of such assets. Oracle also showed an increase, from $11.987 billion in 2023 to $15.493 billion in 2024, which aligns with a growing emphasis on long-term strategic holdings. Collectively, these trends reflect differing corporate strategies: Apple and Oracle appear to be expanding their long-term asset bases, while Accenture is reducing its exposure to 'Other Non-Current Assets'.",

      "answer": "AMD reports $970 million in IPR&D as part of its intangible assets, which is not subject to amortization and is separately disclosed. AVGO acquired $4,730 million in IPR&D as part of its VMware acquisition, with $4,705 million related specifically to VCF, and valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. CSCO provides a policy-level disclosure that IPR&D is capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life, assessed for impairment until completed, at which point it is reclassified and amortized. Comparing these, AMD and AVGO both quantify IPR&D as a significant asset, while CSCO focuses on the accounting methodology rather than specific dollar values, suggesting differing levels of emphasis on IPR&D transparency.",

      "question": "How do AVGO, MSFT, and NVDA each compare in terms of their cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue, and what does this reveal about their operational efficiency and business model structures?",
      "answer": "AVGO reported a total cost of revenue of $11,108 million in fiscal year 2022, which accounted for 33% of its total net revenue. MSFT, on the other hand, had a total cost of revenue of $62,650 million in the same period, representing 31.6% of its total revenue. NVDA's cost of revenue was significantly lower at $141 million, making up just 0.6% of its total revenue. These figures suggest that AVGO and MSFT have more traditional product and service-based cost structures, while NVDA's business model is far less cost-intensive in terms of direct revenue-related expenses, indicating a potentially more scalable or asset-light approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 Cost of Revenue: AVGO's total cost of revenue was $11,108 million, or 33% of total net revenue, indicating a significant portion of revenue is tied to direct costs.",
        "Hop 2: MSFT \u2192 Cost of Revenue: MSFT's total cost of revenue was $62,650 million, or approximately 31.6% of total revenue, showing a similar cost intensity to AVGO but at a much larger scale.",
        "Hop 3: NVDA \u2192 Cost of Revenue: NVDA's cost of revenue was only $141 million, which represents just 0.6% of its total revenue, highlighting a very low-cost structure relative to revenue."

Intel (INTC) operates in the cloud segment through its Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG), where it provides 3D NAND SSDs like the Intel SSD D5-P5316 for data centers, showing its hardware-level contribution to cloud infrastructure. Microsoft (MSFT), while not directly naming the cloud, allocates costs and revenues across its integrated segments, some of which benefit from cloud-related contracts and services, particularly Azure. The synthesis reveals that ACN leverages cloud as a service enabler, INTC as a hardware provider, and MSFT as a cloud platform operator with internal cost-sharing mechanisms that reflect cloud's integral role.",

NSG is disrupting the memory and storage hierarchy with new tiers that balance capacity, performance, and cost. Our products are available in innovative form factors and densities to address the memory and storage challenges our customers face in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Our customers include enterprise and cloud-based data centers, and users of business and consumer desktops and laptops.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue was lower in 2021, driven by market softness and pricing pressure. NAND profitability improved due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale throughout 2021.\n- \u25a0 We launched the Intel SSD D5-P5316, our first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the Data Center, which is available up to 30.72TB in both the U.2 and efficient E1.L form factors. An upgrade of our SATA drive, the Intel SSD D3-S4520 and D3-S4620, also launched with Intel's latest-gen 144-layer TLC NAND and is available in 2.5' and M.2 form factors up to 7.68TB capacity. For our consumer market, the Intel  SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND launched with improved performance, storage responsiveness, and endurance with high capacity (up to 2TB). \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- \u25a0 In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business. The NAND memory business makes up our NSG segment. The transaction will occur over two closings, the first of which was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\n\"Storage technologies help drive the computing experience. Put simply, in today's data-driven world, advances in both data center and client computing need to be matched by cutting-edge innovation in the memoryand-storage space.\"\n\n-Rob Crooke, NSG General Manager\n\n## 5-Year Trends",

However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.\n\nIn addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated.\n\nSegment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:\n\n",

      "question": "How do AMD, CSCO, and MSFT each articulate their reliance on or expectations around cash from operations, and what does this reveal about their differing liquidity strategies and capital allocation priorities?",
      "answer": "AMD plans to fund its $4 billion stock repurchase program through cash generated from operations, signaling strong operational performance as a key enabler of shareholder returns. CSCO highlights that its free cash flow, derived from operating activities, directly informs its dividend and stock repurchase commitments, though it notes volatility in cash from operations due to shipment timing, receivables, and supply chain factors. MSFT reports a $12.3 billion increase in cash from operations to $89.0 billion in fiscal 2022, which supports its significant capital deployment activities including a $5.3 billion increase in stock repurchases and $13.1 billion in acquisitions, indicating a robust and growing operational cash engine enabling strategic investments and shareholder returns. Together, these perspectives show that while all three rely heavily on cash from operations, their liquidity strategies differ in terms of capital return aggressiveness, sensitivity to operational timing factors, and reinvestment priorities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Cash from Operations: AMD states it will fund a $4 billion stock repurchase program through cash generated from operations, indicating operational strength is central to its capital allocation strategy.",

Equity  investments  were  $6.9  billion  and  $6.0  billion  as  of  June  30,  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  Our  short-term investments  are  primarily  intended  to  facilitate  liquidity  and  capital  preservation.  They  consist  predominantly  of  highly  liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed  to  achieve  economic  returns  that  correlate  to  certain  fixed-income  indices.  The  settlement  risk  related  to  these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\n\n## Valuation\n\nIn  general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value  of  our  financial  instruments.  This  pricing  methodology  applies  to  our  Level  1  investments,  such  as  U.S.  government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices  that  are  observable  either  directly  or  indirectly.  This  pricing  methodology  applies  to  our  Level  2  investments,  such  as commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  U.S.  agency  securities,  foreign  government  bonds,  mortgage-  and  asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with  unobservable  inputs. Assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis  using  unobservable  inputs  are  an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\n\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either  provide  a  quoted  market  price  in  an  active  market  or  use  observable  inputs  for  their  pricing  without  applying  significant adjustments.  Broker  pricing  is  used  mainly  when  a  quoted  price  is  not  available,  the  investment  is  not  priced  by  our  pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nCash from operations increased $12.3 billion to $89.0 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. Cash used in financing increased $10.4 billion to $58.9 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $5.3 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $5.3 billion increase in repayments of debt. Cash used in investing increased $2.7 billion to $30.3 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $13.1 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $3.3 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, offset in part by a $15.6 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Investments\n\nThe Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company monitors and manages the overall exposure of its cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis. The Company's marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of investmentgrade securities and the Company's policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable for estimated credit losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.\n\nNo single customer accounted for ten percent or more of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located outside the Americas were 17 percent and 16 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located in the United States were 81 percent and 82 percent of total assets, respectively.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio, including within specific industries, as the Company primarily invests in enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators. As of January 31, 2025, the Company held four investments, all privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its total strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately 24 percent of the portfolio in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2024, the Company held two investments, both privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately 16 percent of the portfolio in the aggregate.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company's enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, 'Cloud Services'), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the basic subscription or software license sales. Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for process mapping, project management and implementation services and training services.\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\n\nThe Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:\n\n- identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n- identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- determination of the transaction price;\n- allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n- recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\n\nSubscription and Support Revenues\n\nSubscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement.\n\nCloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Substantially all of the Company's subscription service arrangements are noncancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\n\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized",

      "answer": "Intel's gross margins were negatively impacted by manufacturing delays, including $922 million in Gaudi AI accelerator inventory-related charges and challenges in achieving expected cost improvements on new process nodes. NVIDIA faced margin pressures due to mismatches between supply and demand, long manufacturing lead times, and commitments to secure supply that increased product costs. In contrast, Texas Instruments reported improved gross margins as a result of its efficiency initiatives, which are part of a broader strategy focused on disciplined capital allocation and operational optimization. When compared, Intel and NVIDIA's margin challenges reflect external supply chain constraints and internal execution risks, while Texas Instruments' margin improvement highlights a more controlled, internally driven operational model that emphasizes long-term free cash flow growth.",

          "chunk_text": "## The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties.\n\nWe are continually engaged in the development of next-generation technologies. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes and other technologies is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially  anticipated.\n\nWe are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our 7nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. In 2022, Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party foundries, such as TSM C, to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. On the product side, we have had limited market success with our accelerator offerings, and in 2024 we recognized $922 million in Gaudi A I accelerator inventory-related charges. We may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of further delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products or lack of market success with our offerings.\n\nOur efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&amp;D investments, particularly as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses, as we were required to do in the third quarter of 2024 with respect to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications). Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs, adversely affect our gross margins, and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A  new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. In addition, the cost of new leading-edge process nodes continues to increase at a higher rate relative to legacy process nodes due to a number of factors, including the cost of procuring and operating advanced manufacturing equipment. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have increased the number of transistors per die, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products.\n\nOur disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability  to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.\n\nFrom time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses; interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions-all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could result in production timing delays. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability  to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation\n\n33",

These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our A I cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\n\n## Risks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\n\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately , has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\n\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the  semiconductor  industry  and/or  limited  supply  or  capacity  in  our  supply  chain,  the  lead  times  for  certain  supply   may   be  ex tended.  W e  hav e  prev iously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. T o secure future supply and capacity , we have paid premiums, provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs.\n\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory , significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and contract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply , we may not be able to meet increased customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share. A dditionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties.\n\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly . We have had to reduce average selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers' increase in prices, write down our inventory , incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may have to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. A ll of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\n\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, include:\n\n- changes in product development cycles and time to market;\n- competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\n- changes in business and economic conditions;\n- sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\n- rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n- the availability  of sufficient data center capacity  or energy  for customers to procure;\n- new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n- new or unexpected end-use cases;\n- increase in demand for competitive products;\n- changes in end-user demand;",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\n## ITEM 1. Business\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we hav e design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. In 2024, we generated $15.64 billion of rev enue.\n\nFor decades, we hav e operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from v acuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each generation has become more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors are used by a growing number of customers and markets. Our passion continues to be aliv e today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications.\n\nFor many years, we hav e run our business with three ov erarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ev er changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. Our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable and env ironmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achiev ing these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.\n\nAs engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innov ate to create a better world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objectiv e and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term.\n\nOur strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\nThe first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitiv e advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made ov er the years and that continue today. The four sustainable competitiv e adv antages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and div ersity and longev ity of our products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitiv e advantages prov ide tangible benefits, are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitiv e adv antages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our inv estments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and lev eraging of these adv antages.\n\nThe second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, dev elop new capabilities, inv est in manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Ov er a 10-year period from 2015 to 2024, we allocated $101 billion, which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation ov er this period was to driv e organic growth, which includes inv estments in R&amp;D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inv entory. In this period, we allocated about $20 billion to capital expenditures. Our increased capital expenditures are to support future rev enue growth, which will be a greater component of free cash flow per share growth going forward. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to div idends and share repurchases. Div idends are designed to appeal to a broad set of inv estors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretiv e capture of future free cash flow for long-term inv estors. Lastly, for inorganic growth, we allocate to acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectiv es.\n\nThe third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striv ing for more output for ev ery dollar spent. This is about getting our inv estments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; it is not just about optimizing cost cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improv ement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to rev enue growth, improv ed gross margins, disciplined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth.",

      "answer": "AMD emphasizes its collaborative design process with customers, which it claims improves time-to-market and fosters long-term product adoption. Intel, on the other hand, has faced repeated time-to-market disadvantages due to delays in its 10nm and 7nm process technologies, as well as recent setbacks with its Intel 7 process node, which led to $3.1 billion in asset impairment charges. NVIDIA experiences extended lead times\u2014often exceeding 12 months\u2014and has struggled with supply-demand mismatches that have harmed its financial results and customer relationships. Together, these perspectives reveal that while AMD leverages customer alignment to accelerate time-to-market, Intel and NVIDIA face structural and operational constraints that delay product delivery and weaken competitive positioning.",

          "chunk_text": "ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. As we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, Malaysia, and Israel, and we may have additional project delays or project cancellations in the future. M oreover, many of the largest potential foundry customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality  information, intellectual property , and foundry  capacity , among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly uncertain.\n\n## We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a favorable return.\n\nTo compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&amp;D efforts and capital investments we require are intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies and we may not have the ability to fund such investments at the level needed to be competitive. We incurred R&amp;D expenses of $16.5 billion in 2024, $16.0 billion in 2023 and $17.5 billion in 2022. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, A I, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneA PI portfolio of developer tools. Our investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our competitors. This has in the past and may in the future result in higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity, higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for A I and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and higher costs due to the utiliz ation of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.\n\nThe investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical lev els. In recent y ears, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utiliz ing leading process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV  and high-NA  EUV  lithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in us incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utiliz ation of ex isting facilities, facility  construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employ ment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are expected to deliver, or if demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable market factors. A s we have reassessed demand and our \"shell ahead\" status and our financial results in the last few years have constrained our ability to make capital investments, we have delayed manufacturing facility construction or expansion projects in Ohio, Germany, Poland, M alaysia, and Israel. We could also be required to write off inv entory  or record ex cess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we recorded $3.1 billion of charges related to non-cash impairments and the accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our A I cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\n\n## Risks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\n\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately , has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\n\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the  semiconductor  industry  and/or  limited  supply  or  capacity  in  our  supply  chain,  the  lead  times  for  certain  supply   may   be  ex tended.  W e  hav e  prev iously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. T o secure future supply and capacity , we have paid premiums, provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs.\n\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory , significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and contract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply , we may not be able to meet increased customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share. A dditionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties.\n\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly . We have had to reduce average selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers' increase in prices, write down our inventory , incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may have to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. A ll of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\n\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, include:\n\n- changes in product development cycles and time to market;\n- competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\n- changes in business and economic conditions;\n- sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\n- rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n- the availability  of sufficient data center capacity  or energy  for customers to procure;\n- new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n- new or unexpected end-use cases;\n- increase in demand for competitive products;\n- changes in end-user demand;",

The inputs we use to estimate the fair values of these instruments are generally unobservable, and therefore, they are included in Level 3.\n\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements: We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities include equity method and non-marketable equity investments, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition or in a nonmonetary exchange, and property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired, all of which are generally measured based on unobservable inputs using an income or market approach.\n\nInventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. Recoverability of inventories is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factors, including committed purchase orders from customers as well as purchase commitment projections provided by customers and our own forecasts of customer demand, among other factors. This valuation also requires us to make judgments and assumptions based on information currently available about market conditions, including competition, anticipated technological changes, internal product life cycle and development plans, product pricing and other broader market conditions that may impact customer demand, such as the impact of certain capacity constraints experienced across the semiconductor industry through the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2021, as well as the impact of the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2022. We generally place binding purchase orders with our suppliers in advance of receiving contractually binding forecasts and/or purchase orders from our customers. The time period between placing purchase orders with our suppliers and receiving contractually binding forecasts and/or purchase orders from our customers has increased and may continue to increase as a result of extended manufacturing lead-times, driven in part by a continued transition to leading-edge technologies and/or increased complexity in the manufacturing process of our products. If we overestimate demand for our products, the amount of our loss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchases from our suppliers. Our manufacturing relationships generally allow for cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments, but in some cases may require incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance related to capacity underutilization. Further, if our customers cancel purchase orders or alter forecasts this may result in excess inventory on hand. Our assumptions of future product demand are inherently uncertain, and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to record additional write-downs in the future if demand forecasted for specific products is greater than actual demand.\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Upon the retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded, when appropriate. Buildings on owned land are depreciated over 30 years, and building improvements are depreciated over 15 years. Leasehold improvements and buildings on leased land are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives, not to exceed 15 years and 30 years, respectively, or the remaining term of the related lease. Other property, plant and equipment have useful lives ranging from 2 to 15 years. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals or betterments are charged to expense as incurred.\n\nOperating Leases. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Operating leases are included in other assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option. We account for substantially all lease and related non-lease components together as a single lease component. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination, the estimated fair values of the assets received are used to establish their recorded values. For intangible assets acquired in a nonmonetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred (or the estimated fair values of the assets received, if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, unless the values of neither the assets received nor the assets transferred are determinable within reasonable limits, in which case the assets received are measured based on the carrying values of the assets transferred. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires us to use assumptions to estimate future cash flows including those related to total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models and from the future cash flows actually realized.\n\nImpairment of Goodwill, Other Indefinite-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter, and in interim periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. If a qualitative assessment is used and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. If goodwill is quantitatively assessed for impairment and a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment. Other",

      "answer": "Apple noted that the COVID-19 pandemic, trade tensions (particularly U.S.-China tariffs), and natural disasters have increased product costs and disrupted supply chains, directly affecting gross margins and profitability. Broadcom highlighted that its cost structure is significantly influenced by tax policies, transfer pricing audits, and the volatility of interest rates due to its large debt load of $41.218 billion, which could lead to higher interest expenses and reduced financial flexibility. Cisco described ongoing supply chain constraints and pandemic-related disruptions that have increased costs and delayed product delivery, impacting profitability and cash flow. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies faced external pressures in 2022, Apple was most exposed to geopolitical and pandemic-driven supply chain risks, Broadcom to financial and tax-related volatility, and Cisco to pandemic-induced operational and liquidity challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.\n\nOur income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including:\n\n- reorganization or restructuring of our businesses, tangible and intangible assets, outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure;\n- jurisdictional mix of our income and assets;\n- changes in the allocation of income and expenses, including adjustments related to changes in our corporate structure, acquisitions or tax law;\n- changes in U.S and foreign tax laws and regulations, changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, taxation of U.S. income generated from foreign sources, the deductibility of expenses attributable to income and foreign tax credit rules;\n- tax effects of increases in non-deductible employee compensation; and\n- changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nWe have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of services, the sale of products, the arrangement of financing and the grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm's length basis. Our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local authorities that our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm's length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of comprehensive treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, result in adjustments for prior or future years. The effects of any such changes could subject us to higher taxes and our earnings, results of operations and cash flow would be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to, and are under, tax audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals. The ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\n## Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy.\n\nAs of October 30, 2022, the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes was $41,218 million. This amount does not reflect any debt we expect to incur or assume in connection with the VMware Merger.\n\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including:\n\n- increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n- exposing us to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facilities, which we do not typically hedge against;\n- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry;\n- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n- making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes; and\n- potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs.\n\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. While we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these agencies, we may be unable to do so. Any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could:\n\n- adversely affect the trading price of, or market for, our debt securities;\n- increase interest expense under our term facilities;\n- increase the cost of, and adversely affect our ability to refinance, our existing debt; and\n- adversely affect our ability to raise additional debt.",

Risk Factors\n\nSet  forth  below  and  elsewhere  in  this  report  and  in  other  documents  we  file  with  the  SEC  are  descriptions  of  the  risks  and uncertainties  that  could  cause  our  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  the  results  contemplated  by  the  forward-looking statements contained in this report.\n\n## Risks Related to our Business and Industry\n\n## Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  resulting  containment  measures  have  caused  economic  and  financial  disruptions  globally, including in most of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. Beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our financial results and business operations. We continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply chain costs. The magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and could in the future materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  Shelter-in-place  and/or  lockdown  orders globally and other measures have and could in the future impact our supply chain. In addition, current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, can  also  impact  our  ability  to  meet  customer  demand  and  could  materially  adversely  affect  us.  Our  customers  have  also experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, and increased collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.\n\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend  on  many  factors  outside  our  control,  including,  without  limitation,  the  timing,  extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the pandemic, the efficacy of available vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. Potential negative impacts of these external factors include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services; our supply chain and sales and distribution channels; collectability of customer accounts; our ability to execute strategic plans; impairments; and our profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this 'Risk Factors' section.\n\n## Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\n\nOur operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. These factors include:\n\n- Fluctuations  in  demand  for  our  products  and  services,  especially  with  respect  to  service  providers  and  Internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment\n- Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers' spending plans and associated revenue\n- Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments\n- Price  and  product  competition  in  the  communications  and  networking  industries,  which  can  change  rapidly  due  to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions\n- The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers\n- The  introduction  and  market  acceptance  of  new  technologies  and  products,  and  our  success  in  new  and  evolving markets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards\n- The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time\n- Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales",

      "answer": "Intel (INTC) highlights a broad range of factors that could impact its effective tax rate, including potential liabilities from tax audits, changes in tax laws (such as the OECD Pillar Two minimum tax), and adjustments to deferred tax assets, which could significantly affect its net income. Microsoft (MSFT) discloses $641 million in accrued legal liabilities as of June 30, 2024, with an additional $600 million in reasonably possible adverse outcomes from ongoing litigation, including a high-profile GDPR-related case in Ireland. Qualcomm (QCOM) emphasizes legal and regulatory risks tied to environmental compliance, particularly in the context of evolving climate change laws and potential liabilities from hazardous substance remediation, which could disrupt operations and increase costs. When combined, these disclosures reveal that INTC faces complex tax-related legal exposure, MSFT is dealing with significant direct financial liabilities from regulatory actions, and QCOM is exposed to operational and environmental legal risks that could impact production and profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our net income.\n\nA number of factors can impact our future effective tax rate or cash payments, which could cause significant variability in our financial results, including:\n\n- changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;\n- changes in our business or legal entity operating model;\n- the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;\n- changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n- adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n- increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n- changes in available tax credits, including non-US tax credits, R&amp;D credits, and refundable tax credits;\n- expirations or changes in our ability to secure new tax holidays and incentives;\n- changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including the global implementation of a minimum tax under Pillar Two of the OECD BEPS initiative;\n- changes in US GAAP and non-US IFRS; and\n- our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for incremental taxes, including any local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.\n\n## Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\n\nOur operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by: severe weather events and natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues and global pandemics such as COVID-19; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation restrictions or disruptions, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; manufacturing equipment failures; geopolitical conflict; terrorism; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities, including our facilities located in water-sensitiv e regions such as A riz ona and Israel. In addition, to the ex tent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources, our reputation could be harmed. In recent years, the west coast of the US has experienced significant wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities, and in California, where we are headquartered. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear but could be severe.\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, safety, and product regulations.\n\nThe design, manufacturing, assembly, and test of our products require the use and purchase of materials and chemicals that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict minerals), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and use of our real property. The scope and interpretation of such laws and regulations, including the materials they govern, are complex and continue to evolve. The procedures and processes in place under our compliance program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and cannot guarantee compliance by employees or third parties to whom such laws apply. The amendment or expansion of these laws or regulations, as well as our failure or inability  to comply  with them (including as a result of acquired entities), can result in regulatory  penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; increased costs; additional remediation obligations; suspension of production; alteration, suspension, or termination of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes, including due to an inability to find, afford, or attain adequate substitute materials, equipment, or processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. In addition, the failure or inability  to comply  by  our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our production processes and sources, and result in increased risks and costs.\n\nThe failure or inability  by  us, our customers, or our suppliers to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, including with respect to the materials and processes we are permitted to use and as to air quality and wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to manufacture products or expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Env ironmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, cease the use of a particular material or process, remove or remediate hazardous substances, or incur other expenses or liabilities. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter, where feasible, our production processes and sources. In addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. Regulations in response to human health concerns may also limit or prohibit the use of a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFA S), which are found in parts, components, process chemicals, and other materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. Such chemicals are critical to the manufacturing and functioning of many semiconductor products and there are limited\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC prov ided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR v iolations and proposing a fine. In July 2024, the IDPC prov ided LinkedIn with a rev ised non-public draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision, at which time Microsoft will consider its options to appeal.\n\n## Other Contingencies\n\nWe also are subject to a v ariety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.

While we intend to defend these matters v igorously, adv erse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfav orable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adv erse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.\n\n## NOTE 16 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\n## Shares Outstanding\n\nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "our third-party suppliers' manufacturing facilities, which could result in disruptions to our business or additional costs to us, and negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nThere are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyberattacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues.\n\nWe operate various facilities that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products. Our manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fix ed costs relative to a fabless model. We may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products, including in less favorable industry or macroeconomic environments, or due to our failure to win and/or retain designs with OEMs. As a result, from time to time our manufacturing facilities operate at lower capacity levels, while the fix ed costs associated with such facilities continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.\n\nWe are subject to many complex environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and rules in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing and other facilities. The regulatory landscape in these areas continues to evolve, and we anticipate additional laws, regulations and rules in the future. In particular, new, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules, including relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investments in production processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. In addition, certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property, or parties who arranged for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities, for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances. As a result, we may incur clean-up costs in connection with any such removal or remediation efforts, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites. In addition, we could be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. If we, or companies or facilities we acquire or have acquired, in the past failed or in the future fail to comply with any such laws and regulations, then we could incur regulatory penalties, fines and legal liabilities; suspension of production; significant compliance requirements; alteration of our manufacturing, assembly or test processes; restriction on our ability to modify or expand our facilities; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot make assurances that we will at all times be in compliance with such laws, regulations, rules and permits. See also the risk factor titled 'Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.'\n\nClimate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, climate change could cause certain natural disasters, such as drought, wildfires, storms, flooding or rising sea levels, to occur more frequently or with greater intensity, which could pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers' facilities, could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of such facilities, and could increase or decrease temperatures resulting in increased operating costs and/or business disruption.\n\nWe have manufacturing facilities in Asia and Europe, and the primary warehouses where we store finished goods are located in Asia. If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, drought or other natural disasters, effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts were to damage, destroy or disrupt any of these facilities, it could disrupt our operations, cease or delay production and shipments of inventory and result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs and lost business. In addition, natural disasters, effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels and supply chains and significant increases in the prices of raw materials. Further, health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, and government and business responses thereto, could affect our manufacturing facilities, including by resulting in quarantines and/or closures, which could result in disruptions to and potential closures of our manufacturing operations. Our manufacturing operations could also be disrupted by cyber-attacks on our IT systems, as described in the Risk Factor below titled 'Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.'\n\nOur manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials, equipment and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, including in some cases sole suppliers, particularly in Asia. There may be cases where supplies of raw materials, equipment and other products are interrupted or limited by natural disaster, geopolitical conflict, accident or some other event affecting a supplier or source of raw materials; supply is suspended due to quality or other issues; there is a shortage of supply due to a rapid increase in demand; and/or we or our suppliers are prohibited from utilizing certain raw materials, or products or components that incorporate such raw materials, due to government restrictions related to the countries from which such raw materials originate, and acceptable alternative suppliers, raw materials or raw materials sources are not available or not available in acceptable time frames or upon acceptable terms, among others, which could impact production and prevent us from",

      "answer": "Accenture reported a $264 million increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, reflecting a slight percentage increase from 10.3% to 10.6% of total operating expenses. Microsoft noted a $1.7 billion (7%) rise in sales and marketing expenses, largely driven by the Gaming segment and the Activision Blizzard acquisition, indicating a strategic push in this area. Oracle highlighted that its sales and marketing expenses are largely personnel-related and tied to variable compensation for hardware sales, aligning with its dual sales model involving both direct and indirect distribution channels. Collectively, these trends show Accenture maintaining a measured investment in sales, Microsoft aggressively scaling through acquisitions and marketing in gaming, and Oracle focusing on incentive-driven sales strategies for hardware offerings.",

The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our i nternal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, i ncluding the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.\n\n",

AVGO discloses $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations as of November 3, 2024, which includes unearned revenue and indicates ~43% is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. NVDA reports $81 million and $233 million in unearned revenue related to support and services as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, respectively, showing a declining trend.

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usage-based royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of November 3, 2024 were approximately $20.5 billion. We expect approximately 43% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. For contracts with termination for convenience rights, our customers generally do not exercise those rights. In addition, the majority of our revenue is from contracts with a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods.\n\n## 4. Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the VMware Merger. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger was indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash or 2.52 shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis). The stockholder election was prorated, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, in each case, was equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger. Based on the VMware stockholders' elections, the VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock with a fair value of $53,398 million.\n\nWe funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Term Loans, as defined and discussed in Note 10. 'Borrowings', as well as cash on hand. We assumed $8,250 million of VMware's outstanding senior unsecured notes.\n\n## Purchase Consideration\n\n",

NVDA similarly capitalizes IPR&D at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and reclassifies it to amortizable intangible upon completion, with a detailed focus on cash flow projections and impairment testing. Together, these disclosures suggest that while all three companies follow similar accounting frameworks for IPR&D, NVDA and CSCO place greater emphasis on the dynamic valuation and integration of R&D assets post-acquisition, whereas AVGO appears to have a more static or mature IPR&D portfolio.",

The  excess  of  the  fair  value  of  purchase  consideration  over  the  fair  values  of  these  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  is recorded as goodwill. IPR&amp;D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&amp;D project is completed, the IPR&amp;D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset  and  amortized  over  the  asset's  estimated  useful  life.  Acquisition-related  expenses  and  related  restructuring  costs  are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\n\n(k) Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets   Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. When impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair  value.  Identifying  a  potential  impairment  consists  of  comparing  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  with  its  carrying  amount, including goodwill. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. See 'Long-Lived Assets' for our policy regarding impairment testing of purchased intangible assets with finite lives. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired.\n\n(l) Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of longlived  assets  is  based  on  an  estimate  of  the  undiscounted  future  cash  flows  resulting  from  the  use  of  the  asset  and  its  eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.",

Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months  are  included  in  operating  lease  assets,  accrued  and  other  current  liabilities,  and  long-term  operating  lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\n\nOperating  lease  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  based  on  the  present  value  of  the  remaining  lease  payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential  impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\n\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.\n\nOur quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited  to,  prospective  financial  information,  growth  rates,  residual  values,  discount  rates  and  comparable  multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\n\n## Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&amp;D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise  used  up  or,  if  that  pattern  cannot  be  reliably  determined,  using  a  straight-line  amortization  method.  We initially  capitalize  the  fair  value  of  IPR&amp;D  as  an  intangible  asset  with  an  indefinite  life.  When  IPR&amp;D  projects  are completed,  we  reclassify  the  IPR&amp;D  as  an  amortizable  purchased  intangible  asset  and  amortize  over  the  asset's estimated useful life.\n\nLong-lived  assets,  such  as  property  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  subject  to  amortization,  are  reviewed  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\n\n## Business Combination\n\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&amp;D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions  are  inherently  uncertain  and  subject  to  refinement.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  used  in  valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used",

      "question": "How did AVGO, ORCL, and TXN each manage their cash and cash equivalents at the end of their respective fiscal years in 2022, and what does this reveal about their liquidity strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AVGO reported $12.416 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of its fiscal year, reflecting a modest increase from the prior year. ORCL ended its fiscal year with $21.383 billion in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease from the previous year, largely driven by significant stock repurchases and dividend payments. TXN ended its fiscal year with $4.631 billion in cash and cash equivalents, showing a notable increase from the prior year, supported by strong operating cash flows. These differences highlight AVGO\u2019s steady cash position, ORCL\u2019s aggressive shareholder return strategy at the expense of liquidity, and TXN\u2019s focus on building cash reserves despite active capital expenditures and debt management.",

      "question": "How do ADBE, CSCO, and TXN each characterize their deferred compensation obligations, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to executive and employee retention strategies?",
      "answer": "ADBE details a comprehensive deferred compensation plan allowing executives and board members to defer portions of their compensation, with balances of $174 million and $137 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively, indicating a structured long-term retention mechanism. CSCO indirectly references deferred compensation as part of its broader long-term liabilities, suggesting a less transparent or less prominent role in its employee value proposition. TXN explicitly reports deferred compensation liabilities of $395 million and $350 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively, indicating a quantified and consistent approach to deferred compensation as part of its broader liability structure. These differences suggest that ADBE and TXN treat deferred compensation as a significant and disclosed component of executive compensation, while CSCO integrates it within a broader category, potentially signaling a less emphasized or more consolidated approach to long-term employee incentives.",

BENEFIT PLANS\n\n## Retirement Savings Plan\n\nThe  Adobe  Inc.  401(k)  Retirement  Savings  Plan,  qualified  under  Section  401(k)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  is  a retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary, subject to the IRS annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2021, we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee's eligible compensation. We contributed $64 million, $59 million and $52 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We are under no obligation to continue matching future employee contributions and, at our discretion, may change our practices at any time.\n\n## Deferred Compensation Plan\n\nThe Adobe  Inc.  Deferred  Compensation  Plan  is  an  unfunded,  non-qualified,  deferred  compensation  arrangement  under which certain executives are able to defer a portion of their annual compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100% of other specified compensation, including commissions, bonuses and directors' fees. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan year in which election is made or, with respect to equity awards, vests. Members of the Board of Directors are also eligible to participate and are able to defer cash compensation and elect cash benefit distributions in the same manner as executives. Beginning January 1, 2020, only members of the Board are permitted to defer equity awards. For cash benefit elections, distributions are made in cash in the form of a lump sum, or five, ten, or fifteen-year annual installments. For equity award elections, distributions are made in stock in the form of a lump sum payment only.\n\nAs of December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020, the invested amounts under the plan total $151 million and $117 million, respectively and were recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020,  $174  million  and  $137  million,  respectively,  were  recorded  as  long-term  liabilities  to  recognize  undistributed  deferred compensation due to participants.\n\n## NOTE 12.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nOur stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stockbased compensation plans and programs:\n\n## Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Programs\n\nWe grant restricted stock units and performance share awards to eligible employees under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan ('2019 Plan'). Restricted stock units generally vest over four years. Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.\n\nAs of December 3, 2021, we had reserved 46.0 million shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2019 Plan and had 37.9 million shares available for grant.\n\nOur Performance Share Programs aim to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, provide significant award potential  for  achieving  outstanding  Company  performance  and  enhance  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  attract  and  retain  highly talented and competent individuals. The Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award calculation methodology. Shares under outstanding Performance Share Programs may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance  period.  Performance  share  awards  will  be  awarded  and  cliff-vest  upon  the  later  of  the  Executive  Compensation Committee's  certification  of  the  level  of  achievement  or  the  three-year  anniversary  of  each  vesting  commencement  date. Participants can earn between 0% and 200% of the target number of performance shares.\n\nIn  January  2021,  the  Executive  Compensation  Committee  approved  the  2021  Performance  Share  Program,  the  terms  of which are similar to prior year performance share programs as discussed above.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of  our  inventory  purchase  commitments  with  contract  manufacturers  and  suppliers  relate  to  arrangements  to  secure  supply  and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in 'Inventory Supply Chain.'\n\nOther Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of  business,  other  than  operating  leases  and  commitments  with  contract  manufacturers  and  suppliers,  for  which  we  have  not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.\n\nLong-Term  Debt The  amount  of  long-term  debt  in  the  preceding  table  represents  the  principal  amount  of  the  respective  debt instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTransition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ('the Tax Act').\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments,  our  noncurrent  income  taxes  payable  of  approximately  $2.3  billion  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  of  $55  million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Commitments\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments, some of which may be based on the achievement  of  certain  agreed-upon  milestones  or  are  required  to  be  funded  on  demand.  The  funding  commitments  were  $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion as of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer  financings,  and  we  have  determined  that  as  of  July  30,  2022  there  were  no  material  unconsolidated  variable  interest entities.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.\n\nWe  provide  financing  guarantees,  which  are  generally  for  various  third-party  financing  arrangements  extended  to  our  channel partners. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under 'Financing Receivables and Guarantees.'\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia and Ukraine war have not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. These events and resulting economic uncertainty  could  adversely  affect  our  liquidity  and  capital  resources  in  the  future.  Based  on  past  performance  and  current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically,  including  the  following:  working  capital  needs  (including  inventory  and  other  supply  related  payments),  capital expenditures,  investment  requirements,  stock  repurchases,  cash  dividends,  contractual  obligations,  commitments,  principal  and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.  We  expect  increased  payments  related  to  inventory  and  other  supply  related  payments  through  at  least  the  next  12 months.

      "question": "How do ACN, ADBE, and MSFT each allocate resources to Sales and Marketing, and what does this indicate about their respective growth strategies in customer acquisition and market expansion?",
      "answer": "ACN allocated $6,108 million to Sales and Marketing in fiscal 2022, representing 9.9% of total operating expenses, reflecting its focus on maintaining a strong client-facing workforce to support service delivery and client retention. ADBE reported $307 million in Sales and Marketing expenses in 2021, which indicates a more modest investment relative to its overall cost structure, consistent with its mature product portfolio and focus on high-margin software solutions. MSFT, while not disclosing a specific dollar amount, emphasized a strategic intent to continue investing in sales and marketing infrastructure, particularly in cloud offerings and in support of major initiatives like its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## Other Planned Uses of Capital\n\nOn January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. ('Activision Blizzard') for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard's net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard's shareholders, and we expect it to close in fiscal year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\n\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well  as  continue  making  acquisitions  that  align  with  our  business  strategy. Additions  to  property  and  equipment  will  continue, including  new  facilities,  datacenters,  and  computer  systems  for  research  and  development,  sales  and  marketing,  support,  and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating  and  finance  leases  for  datacenters,  corporate  offices,  research  and  development  facilities,  Microsoft  Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nRefer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty  and  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.  We  have  critical  accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  often  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  products  and  services  to  a  customer.  Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price ('SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue  to  the  various  benefits  from  and  the  nature  of  our  SA  program,  judgment  is  required  to  assess  the  pattern  of  delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.",

CSCO reported a gross margin percentage of 64.7% for the year ended July 27, 2024, reflecting a 2.0 percentage point increase year-over-year, indicating margin improvement. MSFT noted a slight increase in gross margin percentage overall, with a 2-point improvement in More Personal Computing, despite a slight decline in Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to 71%.

As AI capabilities improv e and are increasingly adopted, we may see more sophisticated threats created through the use of AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated cyberattacks. These attacks could be crafted with an AI tool to directly attack IT  Systems with increased speed and/or efficiency than a human threat actor or create more effectiv e phishing emails. In addition, the threat could be introduced from the result of our or our customers and business partners incorporating the output of an AI tool that includes a threat, such  as  introducing  malicious  code  by  incorporating  AI  generated  source  code.  Our  network  and  storage  applications,  as  well  as  those  of  our customers,  business  partners,  and  third-party  prov iders,  may  be  subject  to  unauthorized  access  by  hackers  or  breached  due  to  operator  error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.\n\nCyberattacks that breach our security measures, or those of our third-party serv ice prov iders, customers or business partners, could result in any or all of the following, which indiv idually or collectiv ely could materially adv ersely affect our financial condition, our competitiv e position; unauthorized access to,  misuse or disclosure of Confidential Data (such as intellectual property, sensitiv e business information or personally identifiable information (PII)); reputational  harm  and/or  diminution  in  our  competitiv eness;  loss  of  existing  and/or  future  customers;  litigation  and/or  regulatory  inv estigations  or enforcement; significant remediation, restoration and compliance costs; and the div ersion of management's attention and key information technology resources. In addition, many gov ernments hav e enacted and are continuing to enact strict priv acy and security laws, such as the UK's and European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Priv acy Act of 2018 (CCPA), as amended by the California Priv acy Rights Act (CPRA), which prov ide for fines, penalties, and in the case of the CCPA and similar legislation, the basis for priv ate claims for certain types of data breaches. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to  upgrading  application,  computer,  and  network  security  components;  training  workers  to  maintain  and  monitor  our  security  controls;  inv estigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation or regulatory proceedings; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe typically sell our products pursuant to indiv idual purchase orders. We generally do not hav e long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inv entory lev els in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates prov ided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. T o the extent we fail  to  forecast  demand  and  product  mix  accurately  or  are  unable  to  increase  production  or  secure  sufficient  capacity  and  there  is  a  mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and hav e a material adv erse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inv entory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, our Embedded segment rev enue decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize their inv entory lev els. We may build inv entories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or ov erproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inv entory, which could result in write-downs of inv entory and an adv erse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiv ing certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products.\n\nExcess or obsolete inv entory hav e resulted in, and may in the future result in, write-downs of the v alue of our inv entory. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inv entory, a reduction in the av erage selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inv entory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressiv e pricing actions.",

      "question": "How do Cisco, Intel, and Microsoft differ in the magnitude and utilization outlook of their federal net operating loss carryforwards, and what does this suggest about their respective tax planning strategies?",
      "answer": "Cisco reports $302 million in federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, with a significant portion tied to acquisitions and subject to annual limitations, and expects some to expire starting in fiscal 2023. Intel holds $644 million in federal NOL carryforwards, many of which are also acquisition-related and limited in annual recognition, with $357 million deemed unrecoverable. Microsoft has $318 million in federal NOL carryforwards, some of which are subject to annual limitations but are generally expected to be realized. Cisco and Intel both face significant constraints on utilizing these losses due to acquisition-related limits, while Microsoft appears more confident in realizing its carryforwards. This suggests varying degrees of reliance on historical losses for future tax relief, with Intel showing the highest valuation allowance against its federal NOLs, indicating more uncertainty in recovery.",

Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2021 has been an annualized rate of 2.1% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based awards vest and, if applicable, are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options as of May 31, 2024, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has substantially offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase i ndebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2024, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 6.9%.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of RSUs with a value of $5 million or greater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2024 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee.\n\nStock-based awards activity from June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2024 is summarized as follows (shares in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Cisco reported a decrease in total inventory from $3,644 million in 2023 to $3,373 million in 2024, primarily driven by a drop in finished goods ($1,493 million to $1,027 million), suggesting a possible inventory drawdown or improved demand alignment. Microsoft saw a significant reduction in total inventory from $2,500 million in 2022 to $1,246 million in 2023, with the largest decline in finished goods ($1,768 million to $845 million), indicating aggressive inventory optimization or product lifecycle transitions. Qualcomm maintained nearly flat total inventory levels ($6,422 million to $6,423 million), with a notable decrease in work-in-process inventory ($4,096 million to $3,497 million) but an increase in finished goods ($2,150 million to $2,586 million), suggesting a shift toward final product readiness.

For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Dispositions) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nFinancing activities: The $418 million increase in cash used was due to higher cash dividends paid and net purchases of shares, as well as higher purchases of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by higher net proceeds from borrowings. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders' Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nWe believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.\n\nSubstantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally  div idend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.\n\n## Share Purchases and Redemptions\n\nWe intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2025. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity , general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. A dditionally , as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.

A s of January 26, 2025, we had $43.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\n\nOur marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV , Item 15 of this A nnual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nExcept for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at the end of fiscal y ear 2025 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\n\n## Capital Return to Shareholders\n\nOn August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase authorization, without expiration. In fiscal year 2025, we repurchased  310  million  shares  of  our  common  stock  for  $34.0  billion. A s  of  January  26,  2025,  we  were  authorized,  subject  to  certain  specifications,  to repurchase up to $38.7 billion of our common stock.\n\nFrom January 27, 2025 through February 21, 2025, we repurchased 29 million shares for $3.7 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.\n\nIn fiscal y ear 2025, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $834 million. The payment of future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.\n\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction A ct of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost and was not material for fiscal years 2025 and 2024.\n\n## Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\n\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January 26, 2025, by year payable, are as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Accenture (ACN) notes that only the non-cancelable portion of contracts is included in remaining performance obligations, implying a significant portion of bookings are not reflected due to short-notice termination rights. Broadcom (AVGO) quantifies its remaining performance obligations at $20.5 billion as of November 3, 2024, with approximately 43% expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Qualcomm (QCOM) reports that in fiscal 2024, it recognized $312 million in revenue from unearned revenues that were recorded as of the prior fiscal year-end, indicating a more modest and licensing-focused performance obligation fulfillment cycle. This comparison reveals that AVGO has the most substantial and structured backlog with a clear timeline for revenue recognition, while ACN\u2019s exposure is more volatile due to contract terminability, and QCOM\u2019s obligations are largely tied to licensing arrangements with upfront fees.",

      "answer": "AMD withheld 4 million shares at an average price of $110.51 per share in 2023 as payment of withholding taxes related to equity awards, which are treated as common stock repurchases in financial statements but not under the company's formal repurchase plan. CRM actively repurchased shares under a formal $20 billion Share Repurchase Program in fiscal 2023, buying approximately 28 million shares for $4.0 billion at an average cost of $144.94 per share, with additional authorization of $10 billion in February 2024. CSCO maintains a long-standing stock repurchase program with approximately $5.2 billion remaining as of July 27, 2024, and treats tax-withheld shares from restricted stock unit vesting as common stock repurchases in financial statements, even though they are not included in the formal program. Together, these approaches show that while all three companies engage in stock repurchases, CRM takes the most aggressive and formalized approach, AMD uses repurchase-like actions through equity award tax withholding, and CSCO maintains a steady, long-term repurchase capacity without recent large-scale execution.",

      "answer": "Accenture reported $1,659,140 million in property and equipment, net, as of August 31, 2022, showing modest growth from $1,639,105 million in the prior year, indicating a relatively stable asset base aligned with its services-oriented business model. Adobe disclosed $1,673 million in property and equipment, net, for 2021 (vs. $1,517 million in 2020), reflecting a slight increase consistent with its cloud-based software delivery model that requires infrastructure investment but remains asset-light. NVIDIA allocated $144 million to property and equipment, net, as part of its acquisition of Mellanox, highlighting a more targeted capital deployment within the context of a broader $7,134 million acquisition strategy focused on expanding its semiconductor and networking capabilities. Together, these figures suggest varying degrees of capital intensity and strategic asset allocation across services, software, and hardware segments of the IT industry.",

      "answer": "ADBE explicitly states it does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, signaling a preference for reinvestment or stock repurchases. CRM declared $1,549 million in cash dividends during fiscal 2024, indicating a growing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. CSCO maintained a consistent dividend policy, paying $1.58 per share in fiscal 2024, amounting to $6,384 million in total, showing a mature capital return strategy. These differences reflect ADBE's growth-oriented approach, CRM's transitional phase toward shareholder returns, and CSCO's established dividend-paying maturity.",

      "answer": "Adobe accounts for price protection as part of variable consideration in revenue arrangements, estimating and recording reserves based on historical trends and reporting-period-specific data. AMD includes price protection adjustments in its accounts receivable valuation, managing exposure through credit evaluations and maintaining reserves based on historical experience and current credit quality assessments. Intel explicitly offers price protection to distributors, granting credits for the difference between original and current product prices without contractual limits on time or amount, which directly affects its revenue recognition timing and accounts receivable valuation. Together, these approaches show that while all three companies incorporate price protection into financial planning, Adobe focuses on forward-looking reserves, AMD emphasizes credit risk management, and Intel institutionalizes price protection as a structural part of its distribution agreements.",

We have concluded that the onpremise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document  Cloud  customers,  which  is  to  provide  a  complete  end-to-end  creative  design  or  document  workflow  solution  that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.\n\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared  reviews  which  enable  simultaneous  editing  and  commenting  of  PDFs  across  desktop,  mobile  and  web;  automatic  cloud rendering  of  a  design  which  enables  it  to  be  worked  on  in  multiple  mediums;  and  Sensei,  Adobe's  cloud-hosted  artificial intelligence  and  machine  learning  framework,  which  enables  features  such  as  automated  photo-editing,  photograph  contentawareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.\n\nStandalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable inputs, primarily actual historical selling prices  for  performance  obligations  where  available,  and  includes  consideration  of  factors  such  as  go-to-market  model  and geography. Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they are sold and what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g., the performance obligation  is  not  sold  separately),  we  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  by  using  information  that  may  include  reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.\n\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5 years. We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, including contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products. When the expected period of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we expense the amount as incurred, utilizing the practical expedient. We regularly evaluate whether there have been changes in the underlying assumptions and data used to determine the amortization period.\n\nWhen  revenue  arrangements  include  components  of  third-party  goods  and  services,  for  example  in  transactions  which involve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report  revenues  on  a  gross  basis,  or  an  agent,  and  report  revenues  on  a  net  basis.  In  this  assessment,  we  consider  if  we  obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer by evaluating indicators such as which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, which party has discretion in establishing price and the underlying terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction.\n\nWe offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors,  resellers  and/or  end-user  customers.  We  estimate  and  record  reserves  for  these  programs  as  variable  consideration when estimating transaction price. Returns, rebates and other offsets to transaction price are estimated at contract inception on a portfolio basis and assessed for reasonableness each reporting period when additional information becomes available.\n\n## General Contract Provisions\n\nWe maintain  revenue  reserves  for  rebates,  rights  of  return  and  other  limited  price  adjustments.  Distributors  are  allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and for products that are being replaced by new versions. We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. Transaction price is reduced for these amounts based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period, such as volume and timely reporting.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific to each reporting period.

          "chunk_text": "The Company first analyzes qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit  exceeds  its  carrying  amount.  Qualitative  factors  include  industry  and  market  considerations,  overall  financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present  value  of  expected  future  cash  flows  to  determine  a  reporting  unit's  fair  value.  Significant  estimates  include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions.\n\nA goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nFrom time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and  federal  government  clean-up  activities  at  or  near  locations  where  the  Company  currently  or  has  in  the  past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nCash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Other investments in time deposits due within 12 months and marketable securities  are  included  in  short-term  investments.  Classification  of  marketable  securities  as  current  is  based  on  the Company's intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months.\n\n## Accounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivable  are  primarily  comprised  of  trade  receivables  presented  net  of  rebates,  price  protection  and  an allowance  for  credit  loss.  Accounts  receivable  also  include  unbilled  receivables,  which  primarily  represent  work completed  on  development  services  recognized  as  revenue  but  not  yet  invoiced  to  customers  and  semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months.\n\nThe  Company  manages  its  exposure  to  customer  credit  risk  through  credit  limits,  credit  lines,  ongoing  monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and,  at  intervals,  for  existing  customers.  From  this,  the  Company  may  require  letters  of  credit,  bank  or  corporate guarantees  or  advance  payments  if  deemed  necessary.  The  Company  maintains  an  allowance  for  credit  loss, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other Key Information\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\n## Customers\n\nWe sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers, who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers; systems builders that purchase Intel processors and other products from our distributors. We have incentive programs that allow distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to systems integrators. Our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.\n\n## Sales Arrangements\n\nOur products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.\n\nIn accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay.\n\nOur sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors can exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor.\n\n## Distribution\n\nDistributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.\n\n## Seasonal Trends\n\nHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In 2021, continued strong COVID-driven notebook demand in the first half of the year contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe.\n\n## Marketing\n\nOur global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers, and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Celeron , Pentium , and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year, we introduced the Intel Arc brand for our upcoming high-performance graphics products. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOther Key Information\n\n48",

ADBE reported $1,936 million in net property and equipment for 2024, down from $2,030 million in 2023, indicating a moderate reduction in asset base, potentially reflecting asset optimization or depreciation. CRM reported $812 million in net property and equipment as of January 31, 2025, a decrease from $1,054 million the previous year, which may signal a more aggressive approach to reducing physical asset reliance, particularly in favor of leased infrastructure.

      "answer": "Accenture saw an increase in Property and Equipment, Gross from $4,104.692 million to $4,234.974 million, representing a 3.17% growth. AMD experienced a more significant increase from $3,376 million to $3,975 million, reflecting a 17.75% growth. Salesforce reported a more modest growth from $6,841 million to $6,918 million, or roughly 1.13%.

Represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services, primarily inventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.\n\nOther Contractual Commitments. Represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to IT, human resources, and other service agreements.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at October 30, 2022, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $3,229 million of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties classified within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of October 30, 2022 have been excluded from the table above.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies engaged in our lines of business, including commercial disputes, employment issues, tax disputes and disputes involving claims by third parties that our activities infringe their patent, copyright, trademark or other IP rights, as well as regulatory investigations or inquiries. Legal proceedings and regulatory investigations or inquiries are often complex, may require the expenditure of significant funds and other resources, and the outcome of such proceedings is inherently uncertain, with material adverse outcomes possible. IP property claims generally involve the demand by a third-party that we cease the manufacture, use or sale of the allegedly infringing products, processes or technologies and/or pay substantial damages or royalties for past, present and future use of the allegedly infringing IP. Claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate any third-party IP rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers) often involve highly complex, technical issues, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Moreover, from time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights. Regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation, complex IP litigation is generally costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel.\n\n## Lawsuits Relating to California Institute of Technology\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (\"Caltech\") filed a complaint against Broadcom and Apple Inc. on May 26, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the 'U.S. Central District Court'), and an amended complaint adding Cypress Semiconductor Corporation as a defendant on August 15, 2016. The amended complaint alleged that chips that support certain error correction codes as specified in IEEE Standards 802.11n and 802.11ac willfully infringed four patents related to error correction coding: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,116,710; 7,421,032; 7,916,781; and 8,284,833 (''833 patent'). Prior to trial, Caltech dismissed its claims against Cypress and withdrew its infringement allegations as to '833 patent. The complaint sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, as well as attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses. The trial was held in January 2020, and on January 29, 2020, the jury issued its verdict finding infringement and awarding Caltech past damages of $270.2 million from Broadcom and $837.8 million from Apple, for which Apple is seeking indemnification from Broadcom. On August 3, 2020, the U.S. Central District Court issued its judgment, awarding Caltech past damages in the amounts awarded by the jury, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest. Additionally, the U.S. Central District Court awarded Caltech an unspecified amount of ongoing royalties to be determined after the anticipated appeals process is resolved. Neither the jury nor the U.S. Central District Court found willful infringement, which if it had, could have resulted in enhanced damages up to three times the amount awarded.

We have concluded that the onpremise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document  Cloud  customers,  which  is  to  provide  a  complete  end-to-end  creative  design  or  document  workflow  solution  that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.\n\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared  reviews  which  enable  simultaneous  editing  and  commenting  of  PDFs  across  desktop,  mobile  and  web;  automatic  cloud rendering  of  a  design  which  enables  it  to  be  worked  on  in  multiple  mediums;  and  Sensei,  Adobe's  cloud-hosted  artificial intelligence  and  machine  learning  framework,  which  enables  features  such  as  automated  photo-editing,  photograph  contentawareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.\n\nStandalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable inputs, primarily actual historical selling prices  for  performance  obligations  where  available,  and  includes  consideration  of  factors  such  as  go-to-market  model  and geography. Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they are sold and what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g., the performance obligation  is  not  sold  separately),  we  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  by  using  information  that  may  include  reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.\n\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5 years. We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, including contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products. When the expected period of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we expense the amount as incurred, utilizing the practical expedient. We regularly evaluate whether there have been changes in the underlying assumptions and data used to determine the amortization period.\n\nWhen  revenue  arrangements  include  components  of  third-party  goods  and  services,  for  example  in  transactions  which involve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report  revenues  on  a  gross  basis,  or  an  agent,  and  report  revenues  on  a  net  basis.  In  this  assessment,  we  consider  if  we  obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer by evaluating indicators such as which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, which party has discretion in establishing price and the underlying terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction.\n\nWe offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors,  resellers  and/or  end-user  customers.  We  estimate  and  record  reserves  for  these  programs  as  variable  consideration when estimating transaction price. Returns, rebates and other offsets to transaction price are estimated at contract inception on a portfolio basis and assessed for reasonableness each reporting period when additional information becomes available.\n\n## General Contract Provisions\n\nWe maintain  revenue  reserves  for  rebates,  rights  of  return  and  other  limited  price  adjustments.  Distributors  are  allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and for products that are being replaced by new versions. We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. Transaction price is reduced for these amounts based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period, such as volume and timely reporting.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. The primary method of establishing these reserves is to review historical data from prior periods as a",

Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt issuance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.\n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains or losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nProvision for income taxes. We have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax incentives are presently expected to expire in November 2025. The corporate income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in 2028.\n\nEach tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with any such operating conditions specified, we could, in some instances, be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits, or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying, we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled. We may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. Before taking into consideration the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other indirect tax impacts, the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to decrease the provision for income taxes by approximately $1,821 million and $1,156 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nOur interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded, we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm's length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP') requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets, and income taxes. See Note 2. 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates.\n\nRevenue recognition. We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party's rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer. Our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services.\n\nWe recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer. An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates. Different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results. We also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. Thus, the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods.",

We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n\n## License and Development Arrangements\n\nOur  license  and  development  arrangements  with  customers  typically  require  significant  customization  of  our  IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a  single  performance  obligation  over  the  period  in  which  the  development  services  are  performed.  We  measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\n\n## Software Licensing\n\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized  up  front  when  the  software  is  made  available  to  the  customer.  Software  support  revenue  is  recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\n\n## Cloud Services\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software,  are  provided  on  a  subscription  basis  or  a  combination  of  subscription  plus  usage.  Revenue  related  to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.\n\n## Product Warranties\n\nWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace  products  for  any  manufacturing  defects  or  hardware  component  failures.  Cost  of  revenue  includes  the estimated  cost  of  product  warranties  that  are  calculated  at  the  point  of  revenue  recognition.  Under  limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value  of  awards  of  restricted  stock  units,  or  RSUs,  and  performance  stock  units  that  are  based  on  our  corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service  period  while  compensation  expense  for  PSUs  is  recognized  using  an  accelerated  amortization  model.  We estimate the fair  value  of  shares  to  be  issued  under  our  employee  stock  purchase  plan,  or  ESPP,  using  the  BlackScholes  model  at  the  commencement  of  an  offering  period  in  March  and  September  of  each  year.  Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\n\n## Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\n\nWe  currently,  are,  and  will  likely  continue  to  be  subject  to  claims,  litigation,  and  other  actions,  including  potential regulatory  proceedings,  involving  patent  and  other  intellectual  property  matters,  taxes,  labor  and  employment, competition  and  antitrust,  commercial  disputes,  goods  and  services  offered  by  us  and  by  third  parties,  and  other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial",

Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We provide inventory write-downs based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. The write-down is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of cost of sales. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. In addition, we record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory.\n\n(f)  Allowance  for  Accounts  Receivable,  Contract Assets  and  Financing  Receivables       We  estimate  our  allowances  for  credit  losses  using  relevant  available information from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. When assessing for credit losses, we determine collectibility by pooling our assets with similar characteristics.\n\nThe allowances for credit losses are each measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Our internal credit risk ratings are categorized as 1 through 10, with the lowest credit risk rating representing the highest quality. Assets that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. The allowances for credit losses are each measured by multiplying the exposure probability of default, the probability the asset will default within a given time frame, by the loss given default rate, the percentage of the asset not ex pected to be collected due to default, based on the pool of assets.\n\nProbability of default rates are published quarterly by third-party credit agencies. Adjustments to our internal credit risk ratings may take into account including, but not limited to, various customer-specific factors, the potential sovereign risk of the geographic locations in which the customer is operating and macroeconomic conditions. These factors are updated regularly or when facts and circumstances indicate that an update is deemed necessary.\n\n(g)  Financing Receivables and G uarantees   We provide financing arrangements, including loan receivables and lease receivables, for certain qualified end-user customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and services (including technical support and advanced services), and also may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Loan receivables have terms of one year to three years on average. Lease receivables represent sales-type leases resulting from the sale of Cisco's and complementary third-party products and are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average.\n\nOutstanding financing receivables that are aged 31 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. We do not accrue interest on financing receivables that are considered impaired and more than 120 days past due unless either the receivable has not been collected due to administrative reasons or the receivable is well secured and in the process of collection. Financing receivables may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management's opinion, a timely collection of the full principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a financing receivable has been categorized as nonaccrual, interest will be recognized when cash is received. A financing receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer's delinquent balances of principal and interest have been settled, and the customer remains current for an appropriate period.\n\nWe facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term financing, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive a payment for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. Deferred revenue relating to these financing arrangements is recorded in accordance with revenue recognition policies or for the fair value of the financing guarantees.\n\n(h) Leases We lease real estate, information technology (IT) and other equipment and vehicles. We also have arrangements with certain suppliers and contract manufacturers which includes the leasing of dedicated space and equipment costs. Our leases have the option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will ex ercise that option.\n\nAs a lessee, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at commencement. Our ROU lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments related to the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use incremental borrowing rates based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of our lease payments. Certain of our lease agreements contain variable lease payments. Our",

These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our A I cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\n\n## Risks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\n\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately , has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\n\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the  semiconductor  industry  and/or  limited  supply  or  capacity  in  our  supply  chain,  the  lead  times  for  certain  supply   may   be  ex tended.  W e  hav e  prev iously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. T o secure future supply and capacity , we have paid premiums, provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs.\n\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory , significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and contract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply , we may not be able to meet increased customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share. A dditionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties.\n\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly . We have had to reduce average selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers' increase in prices, write down our inventory , incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may have to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. A ll of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\n\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, include:\n\n- changes in product development cycles and time to market;\n- competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\n- changes in business and economic conditions;\n- sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\n- rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n- the availability  of sufficient data center capacity  or energy  for customers to procure;\n- new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n- new or unexpected end-use cases;\n- increase in demand for competitive products;\n- changes in end-user demand;",

      "answer": "AMD explicitly states that its consolidated financial statements include accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, with intercompany accounts and transactions eliminated upon consolidation. NVDA similarly consolidates its wholly-owned subsidiaries and emphasizes the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions, while also detailing its use of estimates for revenue recognition and asset valuation. ORCL includes both wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries in its consolidation, noting the elimination of intercompany transactions and the inclusion of noncontrolling interests as a component of equity and net income. These differences in disclosure suggest that while all three companies consolidate subsidiaries, they vary in the level of detail and emphasis placed on intercompany management and control transfer mechanisms.",

      "question": "How do Salesforce (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT), and Oracle (ORCL) each characterize the impact of security vulnerabilities, competitive pressures, and integration challenges on customer purchasing behavior, and what does this reveal about their respective exposures to demand volatility in the enterprise software and cloud services market?",
      "answer": "Salesforce (CRM) highlights that potential security vulnerabilities in acquired products and integration challenges can delay customer purchases and reduce confidence in their offerings. Microsoft (MSFT) emphasizes that actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in their products or third-party components can lead customers to reduce or delay purchases, especially in regulated industries. Oracle (ORCL) notes that the use of competitors\u2019 technologies can influence customer purchasing decisions and that multicloud strategies may lead customers to migrate away from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offerings. Collectively, these perspectives show that all three firms face demand volatility due to security concerns, integration risks, and competitive dynamics, but each emphasizes different levers influencing customer purchasing behavior.",

      "answer": "In 2024, AMD experienced a significant decline in gaming revenue, reporting $2,595 million compared to $6,212 million in the prior year, indicating a challenging year for its gaming segment. In contrast, Microsoft reported a robust 39% growth in gaming revenue, driven largely by the acquisition of Activision Blizzard and strong performance in Xbox content and services. NVIDIA, while not directly reporting gaming revenue growth, highlighted risks and potential adverse impacts on its gaming revenue stemming from regulatory restrictions in China, particularly around gaming activity limits and data center product standards. This divergence shows that while Microsoft capitalized on strategic acquisitions and content monetization, AMD faced market headwinds, and NVIDIA grappled with external regulatory risks affecting its gaming and broader data center operations.",

The Chinese government may also encourage customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by M icron, a supplier of ours. A s another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an A ction Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chinese government modifies or implements the A ction Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability  of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\nFinally , our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in T aiwan and South Korea. A ny new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from T aiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\n## Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\n\nCertain shareholder advocacy groups, investment funds, shareholders and other market participants, customers and government regulators have focused on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there are state-level initiatives in the U.S. that may differ from other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders' expectations. A dditionally , our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards or legal requirements. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices and legal requirements, choose not to conduct business with potential customers and suppliers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers and suppliers due to our policies. These factors and increased disclosure may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or ex pose us to liability .\n\n## Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\n\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as A I, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm and liability  and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building A I capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-alone A I applications. A I poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society , such as A I solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity , or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy , employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability . Lev eraging A I capabilities to potentially  improv e our internal functions and operations may present further risks, costs, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to A I may further increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, and may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the European Union Code of Practice for General Purpose A rtificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commission regarding details of some of our Trustworthy A I processes related to our risk framework. Furthermore, changes in A I-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of A I by  us or others could undermine public confidence in A I and slow adoption of A I in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\n\n## Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify . A n unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctiv e relief.

      "answer": "Cisco uses advance payments to secure future supply as part of its strategy to manage inventory and address extended lead times caused by industry-wide supply constraints. Intel obtains advance payments from foundry customers to secure capacity and derisk manufacturing investments, particularly as it scales its foundry services. Qualcomm discloses $3.0 billion in advance payments tied to multi-year capacity purchase commitments, reflecting its reliance on foundry suppliers and the financial obligations associated with securing manufacturing capacity.

The combined decrease of 22% in our inventory and inventory purchase commitments as compared with the end of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to our continued efforts to work with contract manufacturers and suppliers to optimize our inventory and purchase commitment levels.\n\nWe have increased our levels of inventory in order to help mitigate risks in our supply chain. We also began increasing our inventory supply chain balances starting in fiscal 2021 in order to address significant supply constraints seen industry-wide. The increases were primarily due to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain  product  components  and  commitments  with  contract  manufacturers  to  meet  customer  demand  and  to  address  extended  lead  times,  as  well  as  advance payments with suppliers to secure future supply, as a result of the supply constraints. Our risks of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses are further outlined in the Result of Operations-Product Gross Margin section.\n\nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and  suppliers  that  allow  them  to  procure  inventory  based  upon  criteria  as  defined  by  us  or  that  establish  the  parameters  defining  our  requirements  and  our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity.\n\nOur  inventory  purchase  commitments  are  for  short-term  product  manufacturing  requirements  as  well  as  for  commitments  to  suppliers  to  secure  manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments are entered into directly with suppliers and relate to fixed-dollar commitments to secure supply and pricing for  certain  product  components  for  multi-year  periods.  A  significant  portion  of  our  reported  purchase  commitments  arising  from  these  agreements  are  firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.\n\nInventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of supply constraints, rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and inventory purchase commitments is appropriate for our current and expected customer demand and revenue levels.\n\nFinancing Receivables and Guarantees The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions):\n\n",

We are committed to coengineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help software and hardware work better together.\n\n## Manufacturing at Scale\n\nWe manufacture a majority of our products in our own manufacturing facilities using our proprietary process technologies. This enables us to optimize performance, shorten time-to-market for new product introductions, and more quickly scale products in high volume.\n\nProcess technology. We continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology as we seek to realize the benefits from M oore's Law, a law of economics predicted by Intel's cofounder Gordon M oore more than 50 years ago. Realizing M oore's Law results in economic benefits as we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we shrink its size or increase functionality and performance of a chip while maintaining the same cost with higher density. This makes possible the innovation of new products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size to meet customers' needs. A s of the end of 2024, our core products were manufactured on 300mm wafers, with a significant majority manufactured using our Intel 7 process node while we ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes into high volume.\n\nFactory network. Our global factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience. We operate wafer manufacturing facilities in the United States (Oregon and A rizona), Ireland, and Israel, assembly and testing facilities in Costa Rica, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and packaging facilities in the United States (New M exico), Costa Rica, V ietnam, and M alaysia. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors and we plan to continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.\n\nFoundry services. The very high capital requirements of modern leading-edge semiconductor process technology development and manufacturing, especially those nodes requiring EUV lithography such as Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 18A  and future nodes, require us to expand the use of our process technologies as they mature and grow the number of wafers produced beyond the expected growth for our own products. To this end, we are seeking to build a world-class foundry business also serving external customers and have made significant investments in ecosystem support to enable the usage of our manufacturing network by external customers. Our foundry offerings include four components: wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplets, and software and services. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable products built with our advanced packaging technology. We plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP.\n\n## Our People\n\nOur world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do. Together we strive to have a positive effect on business, society, and the planet. Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Our people build our technology, unlock new business opportunities, and work with our partners and customers to create global impact.\n\nFostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world's best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet.\n\n## Focus on Innovation and Execution\n\nWe are focused on executing our product and process roadmaps and our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed process and packaging technology roadmap and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering competitive products in every area in which we compete.\n\nWe leverage our Smart Capital approach to help us adjust quickly to opportunities in the market while managing our margin structure and capital spending. The key elements of Smart Capital include:\n\n- Smart capacity investments. We are building out future manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online based on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and customer commitments.\n- Government incentives. We work with governments to advance and benefit from incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity for leading-edge semiconductors.\n- SCIP. We access strategically aligned private capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale manufacturing build-outs. Our SCIP program has supported the period of accelerated manufacturing investment that commenced in early 2021. We signed our latest SCIP agreement in the second quarter of 2024 and are not contemplating further transactions in the near term.\n- Customer commitments. Our foundry business works closely with potential customers to obtain advance payments to secure capacity and participate in manufacturing capacity build-outs. This provides us with the advantage of committed volume, derisking investments while providing capacity corridors for our foundry customers.\n- External foundries. We intend to continue our use of external foundries where their capabilities or capacities support our Intel Products businesses offerings.\n\nOur Strategy",

We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 29, 2024 totaled $12.8 billion of which, $9.6 billion is ex pected to be paid in the nex t 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases. We lease certain of our land, facilities and equipment under operating leases, with terms ranging from less than one year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend for up to 20 years. At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was nine years and eight years, respectively. Operating lease expense for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $184 million, $204 million and $207 million, respectively.

ADBE saw a more robust growth of 13.7% in the Americas, with total revenue reaching $11.654 billion, driven by strong performance in the United States. CRM reported a significant 9.5% year-over-year growth in Americas revenue, reaching $23.289 billion, reflecting strong enterprise demand.

We  remain  focused  on  delivering innovation  across  our  technologies  to  assist  our  customers  in  executing  on  their  digital  transformations.  We  continue  to  be negatively impacted by supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages. While we did see some easing of the supply constraints towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect the constraints to continue and the duration is uncertain. We have, and continue to take, multiple steps in order to mitigate the component shortages and deliver products to our customers. We continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.\n\nTotal  revenue  increased  by  3%  compared  with  fiscal  2021. Within  total  revenue,  product  revenue  increased  by  6%  and  service revenue decreased by 2%. Fiscal 2022 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2021, thus our results for fiscal 2022 reflect one less week compared with fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, total software revenue was flat at $15.1 billion across all product areas and service. Within total software revenue, subscription revenue increased 3%. Total gross margin decreased by 1.5 percentage points. Product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points, largely driven by increased costs related to supply constraints and to a lesser extent, product mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 1.3 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.3 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased 13%, driven by an increase of 12% in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 44 million shares.\n\nIn  terms  of  our  geographic  segments,  revenue  from  the Americas  increased  by  $0.7  billion,  EMEA  revenue  increased  by  $0.8 billion and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $0.3 billion.\n\nFrom a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue growth in the commercial, enterprise and service provider markets partially offset by a decline in the public sector market.\n\nFrom a product category perspective, total product revenue increased 6% year over year, driven by growth in revenue in Secure, Agile Networks of 5%; Internet for the Future of 17%; End-to-End Security of 9% and Optimized Application Experiences of 11%; partially offset by a product revenue decline in Collaboration of 5%.\n\n## Russia and Ukraine War\n\nIn March 2022, in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cisco announced its intention to stop business operations in Russia and Belarus for the foreseeable future. Those operations in Russia and Belarus included sales, services and related support functions. Further, on June 23, 2022, we announced that we will begin an orderly wind-down and exit of our business in Russia and Belarus.\n\nOur business operations in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, collectively, comprised approximately 1% of our total revenue for the year ended July 31, 2021. Russia and Belarus, collectively, represented less than 0.1% of our total assets at the end of fiscal 2022. As a result of the war and the resulting events, we have not recognized revenue in these countries effective March 2022. The negative impact  to  total  revenue  was  approximately  $200  million  for  fiscal  2022,  which  includes  committed  revenue  we  would  have otherwise recognized, charges for uncollectible receivables, and other items. Further, we also assessed the risk to the recoverability of our assets and other potential financial exposures in these countries. We have reserved for the non-recoverability of substantially all of our assets in Russia and Belarus. As a result, we have recognized certain non-recurring charges of $91 million in cost of sales and operating expenses in fiscal 2022 related to non-recoverability of certain assets, special personnel-related charges in order to support impacted employees, and severance and other exit related costs.\n\nThe ongoing effect of the Russia and Ukraine war are difficult to predict due to the other uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.",

If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and longlived assets may be based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, expected selling price and/or other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when appropriate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of such assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values.\n\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated.\n\nRevenue Recognition. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing of our intellectual property. We also generate revenues from licensing system software and by performing development and other services and from other product sales. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our performance obligations.\n\nRevenues from sales of our products are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. Revenues from providing services are typically recognized over time as our performance obligation is satisfied. Revenues from providing services and licensing system software were each less than 5% of total revenues for all periods presented.\n\nWe grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale or use of certain wireless products. Licensees pay royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay a fixed license fee in one or more installments. Sales-based royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). We broadly provide per unit royalty caps that apply to certain categories of complete wireless devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches, and provide for a maximum royalty amount payable per device. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licensee-by-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nLicense agreements that require payment of license fees contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual property that exists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated. Since we expect to expend efforts to develop and transfer updates to our licensed portfolio on an even basis, license fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is executed and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement. If all such conditions are not met, revenues and any associated receivables",

NVDA discloses $1.7 billion in remaining performance obligations from contracts longer than one year, with approximately 39% expected to be recognized in the next twelve months, showing a moderate near-term revenue pipeline. QCOM reports remaining performance obligations primarily included in unearned revenues, with $312 million recognized in fiscal 2024 from prior unearned balances, and excludes short-term contracts and sales-based royalties from this metric. The differences reveal varying levels of revenue visibility and contract structure across the three companies.",

      "question": "How do Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm each characterize the factors influencing their 2024 gross margin percentages, and what does this reveal about their respective sensitivities to inventory management, product mix, and cybersecurity risks?",
      "answer": "Apple directly discloses its gross margin percentages for 2024, 2023, and 2022, indicating a consistent focus on tracking this metric over time. AMD highlights that cybersecurity threats could lead to inventory write-downs and negatively impact gross margins due to disruptions in production planning and demand forecasting. Qualcomm reports that its gross margin percentage remained flat in 2024 despite changes in product mix, such as lower revenues per chipset and IoT units, which were offset by higher shipment volumes and normalization of customer inventory levels. Together, these perspectives show that while Apple emphasizes transparency in margin performance, AMD flags external risks like cyberattacks affecting cost structure, and Qualcomm balances mix effects with volume gains to maintain margin stability.",

As AI capabilities improv e and are increasingly adopted, we may see more sophisticated threats created through the use of AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated cyberattacks. These attacks could be crafted with an AI tool to directly attack IT  Systems with increased speed and/or efficiency than a human threat actor or create more effectiv e phishing emails. In addition, the threat could be introduced from the result of our or our customers and business partners incorporating the output of an AI tool that includes a threat, such  as  introducing  malicious  code  by  incorporating  AI  generated  source  code.  Our  network  and  storage  applications,  as  well  as  those  of  our customers,  business  partners,  and  third-party  prov iders,  may  be  subject  to  unauthorized  access  by  hackers  or  breached  due  to  operator  error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.\n\nCyberattacks that breach our security measures, or those of our third-party serv ice prov iders, customers or business partners, could result in any or all of the following, which indiv idually or collectiv ely could materially adv ersely affect our financial condition, our competitiv e position; unauthorized access to,  misuse or disclosure of Confidential Data (such as intellectual property, sensitiv e business information or personally identifiable information (PII)); reputational  harm  and/or  diminution  in  our  competitiv eness;  loss  of  existing  and/or  future  customers;  litigation  and/or  regulatory  inv estigations  or enforcement; significant remediation, restoration and compliance costs; and the div ersion of management's attention and key information technology resources. In addition, many gov ernments hav e enacted and are continuing to enact strict priv acy and security laws, such as the UK's and European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Priv acy Act of 2018 (CCPA), as amended by the California Priv acy Rights Act (CPRA), which prov ide for fines, penalties, and in the case of the CCPA and similar legislation, the basis for priv ate claims for certain types of data breaches. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to  upgrading  application,  computer,  and  network  security  components;  training  workers  to  maintain  and  monitor  our  security  controls;  inv estigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation or regulatory proceedings; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe typically sell our products pursuant to indiv idual purchase orders. We generally do not hav e long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inv entory lev els in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates prov ided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. T o the extent we fail  to  forecast  demand  and  product  mix  accurately  or  are  unable  to  increase  production  or  secure  sufficient  capacity  and  there  is  a  mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and hav e a material adv erse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inv entory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, our Embedded segment rev enue decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize their inv entory lev els. We may build inv entories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or ov erproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inv entory, which could result in write-downs of inv entory and an adv erse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiv ing certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products.\n\nExcess or obsolete inv entory hav e resulted in, and may in the future result in, write-downs of the v alue of our inv entory. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inv entory, a reduction in the av erage selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inv entory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressiv e pricing actions.",

Sev eral jurisdictions where we operate are considering or have proposed or enacted legislation and policies regulating A I and nonpersonal data, such as the European Union's AI Act and the U.S.'s Executive Order on A I. These regulations may impose significant requirements on how we design, build and deploy A I and handle non-personal data for ourselves and our clients or limit our ability to incorporate certain A I capabilities into our offerings.\n\nWhile we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identify ing or resolv ing issues before they arise. A ny  failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of A I technology in our services and solutions may cause harm to our reputation or financial liability and, as such, may increase our costs to address or mitigate such risks and issues.\n\n## If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our people with market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills, backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly sought-after skills and this will likely continue.\n\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, as a result of technological developments or changes in demand, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand. In some countries we are required by local law to consult with employee representative bodies such as works councils, which may constrain our operational flexibility and efficiency in balancing our workforce with client demand and make us less competitive. In addition, while an immaterial percentage of our global workforce is currently unionized, the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational impediments.\n\nAt certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIf our utiliz ation rate is too high or too low, it could hav e an adv erse effect on employ ee engagement and attrition, the quality  of the work performed as well as our ability  to staff projects.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of A ccenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our businesses. This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in markets where the depth of skilled employees may be limited. Our ability to expand in our key markets depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, develop, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with critical capabilities.\n\nOur equity-based incentive compensation plans and other variable cash compensation programs, as well as promotions, are designed to reward high-performing individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. If the anticipated value of such incentives or the pace of promotions does not materialize because of company performance or volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the people we need could be adversely affected. In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain people could be negatively affected.",

We can provide no assurances that our security measures, including implemented systems and processes designed to protect our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, will provide absolute security or otherwise be effective or that a material breach will not occur. For example, our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following:\n\n- evolving techniques used to breach or sabotage IT systems and infrastructure, including as a result of the increased use of AI technologies by bad actors, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, and could result in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques;\n- the increasing complexity of our internal IT systems as we incorporate and secure IT environments from acquired companies and early adoption of new technologies and new ways of sharing data; and\n- our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers (including those authorized by customers to access their data), or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattacks and have experienced other security incidents. Although, to date, such identified security events have not had a material financial impact, there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant. Additionally, as our market presence grows, we may face increased risks of cyberattacks or security threats, and as AI technologies, including generative AI models, develop rapidly, threat actors are using these technologies to create new sophisticated attack methods that are increasingly automated, targeted and coordinated and more difficult to defend against.\n\nA security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our IT systems or data, or our customers' systems or data, including intellectual property and proprietary, sensitive or other confidential information. We have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. For ex ample, SEC rules require disclosure on Form 8-K of the nature, scope and timing of any material cybersecurity incident and the reasonably likely impact of any such incident. A security breach or resulting mandatory disclosure could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal, regulatory and financial exposure and liability. Further, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business, or reputational losses that may result from a cybersecurity incident or breach of our IT systems. Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including determining whether a cybersecurity incident is notifiable or reportable, may not be straightforward and may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach, such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities.\n\n## Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.\n\nWe have in the past and may in the future find defects in or experience disruptions to our services. Such issues may arise in a variety of circumstances, including due to our customers using our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data; as a result of employee, contractor or other third-party action or inaction; or due to the complexity of our services, which incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party and open-source software. Across the industry, cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We may also encounter difficulties integrating acquired or licensed technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies we use to meet quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation, which may result in our services containing errors or defects.\n\nWe have experienced and may in the future experience defects in our products that create vulnerabilities that inadvertently permit access to protected customer data. We can provide no assurance that such product defects or other vulnerabilities will not occur in the future, have a material adverse effect on our business or subject us to substantial liability. V ulnerabilities in open source or any proprietary or third-party product can persist even after security patches have been issued if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching was complete. In some cases, vulnerabilities may not be immediately detected, which may make it difficult to recover critical services and lead to damaged assets.\n\nSince our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems have in the past adversely impacted our customers' businesses and could do so in the future. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.",

          "chunk_text": "expect to continue to make to develop products and software to address what we believe will be increasing demand for A I capabilities, most notably in A I PCs but also in the data center and in GPUs, may be insufficient, and we face significant hurdles, including whether demand will materialize, whether third-party developers will develop the software to utilize the A I capabilities of our products, and whether we will be successful in developing products that can compete with offerings by established competitors.\n\nOur use of AI technology may subject us to reputational, financial, legal, or regulatory risks. A s we incorporate A I technology into our products and services, any failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of the evolving A I technology in our products and services may cause harm to our reputation or financial liability  and, as such, may  increase our costs to address or mitigate such risks and issues. A I technology may create ethical issues, generate defective algorithms, and present other risks that create challenges with respect to its adoption. In addition, evolving laws, rules, regulations, and industry standards governing AI may require us to expend significant resources to modify, maintain, or align our business practices or products.\n\n## We rely upon a complex global supply chain.\n\nWe have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers. These suppliers provide direct materials for our production processes; supply tools, equipment, and IP (via licenses) for our factories; deliver logistics and packaging services; and supply software, lab, and office equipment, and other goods and services used in our business. We also rely on suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products. From time to time, we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including:\n\n- suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other customers including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;\n- supplier quality issues;\n- cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, man-made or natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), operational failures, or other events that disrupt suppliers;\n- long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers; and\n- increased legislation, regulation, or stakeholder expectations regarding sourcing, including with respect to national security, human rights and environmental impact concerns.\n\nThese and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us from meeting customer demand, damage our customer relationships, or negatively affect our reputation. They may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operations, and financial condition. From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products. During the past several years, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as well as outbreaks of COVID-19, caused supply chain disruptions and delays in obtaining tools and other components, and the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity. These shortages have previously limited our ability  to supply  customer demand in certain of our businesses, and have adversely affected customer demand for our products, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these shortages when they occur.\n\nTo obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we have entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. These arrangements may not be adequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangements falls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable.\n\nWe utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply a number of our products and components necessary for our products that we manufacture. As part of our strategy, we expect to continue to rely upon third-party foundries. Delays in the development of foundries' future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties.\n\nWhere possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain products, components, services, materials, and equipment, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location, which can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. For example, A SM L Holding N.V . (A SM L) is currently the sole supplier of EUV  lithography tools that we are deploying in our Intel 4 and subsequent leading-edge manufacturing process nodes. These tools are highly complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. A s a further example, a limited number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in A sia. Some of our most advanced current and future products are or will be either exclusively manufactured by TSM C or reliant upon critical components, including various compute die, manufactured by TSM C.\n\n## We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues.\n\nFrom time to time, we identify product defects, errata, and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation",

      "question": "How do Accenture's acquisition plans, Intel's forward-looking technology guidance, and NVIDIA's strategic investments in complementary technologies reflect differing approaches to innovation and growth in the information technology sector?",
      "answer": "Accenture plans to acquire complementary businesses or technologies to expand its strategic objectives, with $5.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of August 31, 2024, to support such initiatives. Intel emphasizes its forward-looking statements regarding future products, services, and technologies, including plans for next-generation process nodes, packaging technology, and AI capabilities, which are central to its strategic roadmap. NVIDIA, while investing in businesses that enhance its strategic goals, also highlights risks related to integrating acquisitions and realizing their full potential, indicating a cautious but growth-oriented approach to innovation. Together, these perspectives reveal that Accenture focuses on external growth through acquisitions, Intel emphasizes internal development and roadmap execution, and NVIDIA balances investment with integration risk management.",

      "question": "How do Apple, AMD, and Oracle compare in their 2022 disclosures regarding the value of 'Other Non-Current Assets,' and what might this reveal about their respective asset management strategies?",
      "answer": "Apple reported $54,428 million in Other Non-Current Assets for 2022, reflecting a relatively stable position compared to the prior year. AMD reported $1,478 million in Other Non-Current Assets for 2021, which represents a significant increase from $373 million in the prior year, indicating a notable shift in its non-current asset composition. Oracle reported $9,915 million in Other Non-Current Assets for 2022, showing a modest increase from $8,490 million in the prior year. These differences suggest that Apple maintains a larger and more stable base of other non-current assets, potentially reflecting long-term strategic investments, while AMD appears to be making more dynamic changes in its asset structure, and Oracle shows a more moderate and steady approach.",

      "question": "How do ADBE, CSCO, and ORCL differ in the magnitude and utilization outlook of their state net operating loss carryforwards, and what does this reveal about their respective tax planning strategies?",
      "answer": "ADBE reported state net operating loss carryforwards of $446 million as of December 1, 2023, with a valuation allowance of $405 million, indicating significant uncertainty in realizing these benefits. CSCO had $1.9 billion in state net operating loss carryforwards as of July 27, 2024, with a $10 million valuation allowance, suggesting a more optimistic outlook for utilization. ORCL disclosed $2.1 billion in state net operating loss carryforwards as of May 31, 2024, with $2.0 billion subject to expiration between fiscal 2025 and 2044, indicating a longer runway for utilization but still under constraints. Collectively, these figures suggest varying degrees of confidence in leveraging state NOLs, with ORCL having the largest carryforward base but also the longest expiration timeline, CSCO showing moderate optimism with minimal valuation allowance, and ADBE being the most cautious with a high valuation allowance.",

      "answer": "Accenture reported a 13% attrition rate (excluding involuntary terminations) for fiscal 2024, consistent with fiscal 2023, indicating a stable but competitive talent environment. Adobe experienced a lower attrition rate of 7.4% in fiscal 2023, suggesting strong employee retention and satisfaction. Salesforce reported an attrition rate of approximately 8% as of January 31, 2024, reflecting moderate churn in its customer-facing contracts. These figures indicate differing workforce dynamics: Accenture faces higher turnover likely due to its large, global consulting workforce, while Adobe and Salesforce show lower attrition, potentially linked to their product-centric models and hybrid work strategies.",

We experienced strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, partially offset by lower notebook ASPs due to strength in the consumer and education market segments. DCG was down on lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive environment, partially offset by higher platform  volume from recovery in the enterprise and government market segment. IOTG and Mobileye both achieved strong results on higher demand amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19. We invested $15.2 billion in R&amp;D, made capital investments of $18.7 billion, and generated $30.0 billion in cash from operations and $11.3 billion of free cash flow. 1\n\n\"We achieved solid results amid a highly constrained industry-wide supply environment while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position.

NonGAAP revenue excludes NSG.\n\nHigher gross margin from higher platform and adjacent revenue and Corporate revenue from a prepaid customer supply agreement, partially offset by a Corporate charge related to VLSI litigation, higher period charges from ramp of process technology, and higher operating expenses on increased R&amp;D investment. Non-GAAP operating income incrementally excludes, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, restructuring and the charge related to VLSI litigation. 1\n\n## GAAP\n\nnon-GAAP\n\n2\n\nDiluted EPS down $0.08 or 2% from 2020\n\nDiluted EPS up $0.37 or 7% from 2020\n\nLower operating income partially offset by equity investment gains, lower effective tax rate, and lower shares. Non-GAAP results incrementally exclude ongoing mark-to-market adjustments and tax impacts of non-GAAP adjustments.\n\nGAAP\n\nnon-GAAP 2\n\nOperating cash flow down $5.4B or 15%\n\nFree cash flow down $9.9B or 47%\n\nLower operating cash flow driven by a decrease in net working capital contributions and cash paid to settle a prepaid customer supply agreement in Q1 2021, partially offset by a McAfee special dividend received in Q3 2021. Free cash flow decreased due to lower operating cash flow and higher capital expenditures.\n\n## Investing in our IDM 2.0 strategy for the long term\n\nTo support our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are making significant capital investments to increase our manufacturing capacity and accelerate our process technology roadmap, as well as increasing our investments in R&amp;D. We believe these investments will position us for accelerating long-term revenue growth. We expect our long-term revenue outlook to accelerate to a 10% to 12% year-over-year growth rate by the end of our five-year horizon as supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products. We expect gross margins to be impacted by our investments in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, resulting in expected non-GAAP gross margins percentages between 51% and 53%  over the next several years before moving upward. We also expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. We expect our cash from operations to be strong, but our capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term. 2\n\n- See \"Our Products\" within MD&amp;A. 1\n- See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&amp;A. 2",

Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\n## Product information\n\nSemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as 'chips,' combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have a diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes approximately 80,000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic equipment.\n\nOur segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.\n\n## Analog\n\nOur Analog segment generated $14.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic devices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and personal electronics.\n\nSales of our Analog products generated about 77% of our revenue in 2021.\n\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n\n## Power\n\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated controllers and converters, power switches, linear regulators, voltage references and lighting products.\n\n## Signal Chain\n\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks, logic and sensing products.\n\n## Embedded Processing\n\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $3.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive.\n\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&amp;D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next.",

CRM\u2019s stockholders' equity was $59,646 million out of a total liabilities and stockholders' equity of $99,823 million, showing a balanced capital structure with significant retained earnings of $11,721 million. ORCL, however, had a much lower stockholders' equity of $8,704 million compared to its total liabilities and stockholders' equity of $140,976 million, with a large portion of its capital structure made up of non-current debt ($76,264 million), suggesting a more leveraged financial strategy.

      "answer": "AMD manages its supply chain risk by requiring advance payments, letters of credit, or bank guarantees from customers when deemed necessary, indicating a cautious approach to credit risk. CSCO actively makes advance payments to suppliers to secure future supply, especially in response to industry-wide supply constraints, reflecting a proactive strategy to ensure supply chain stability. QCOM discloses $3.0 billion in advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments as of September 29, 2024, showing a long-term strategic investment in securing manufacturing capacity. Together, these approaches highlight varying degrees of financial commitment and forward planning in response to supply chain volatility, with QCOM emphasizing long-term capacity assurance, CSCO focusing on near-term supply security, and AMD prioritizing risk mitigation from customers.",

      "question": "How do AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm each characterize the impact of manufacturing yield challenges on their cost structures and competitive positioning in the semiconductor market?",
      "answer": "AMD highlights that failing to achieve expected manufacturing yields could materially adversely affect its business, linking yield issues to potential cost increases and supply constraints. Intel emphasizes that lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, especially during transitions to new process nodes like 10nm and 7nm, have increased product costs, hurt gross margins, and contributed to supply constraints, while also allowing competitors to gain an edge. Qualcomm notes that transitions to smaller geometry process technologies add risk to manufacturing yields, which could increase costs, reduce margins, and impact its ability to meet customer demand. Together, these perspectives show that yield challenges are a systemic risk across the industry, affecting cost structures, competitive dynamics, and supply chain reliability, with varying degrees of operational and strategic impact depending on each company's manufacturing model and supplier dependencies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Manufacturing Yields: AMD explicitly lists manufacturing yield risk as a material operational concern that could adversely affect its business, indicating its sensitivity to yield-related cost and supply issues.",

        "Hop 3: Qualcomm \u2192 Manufacturing Yields: Qualcomm states that transitions to smaller geometry process technologies add risk to manufacturing yields, which could increase costs, reduce margins, and impact product reliability and customer satisfaction."

      "question": "How do Adobe (ADBE), Broadcom (AVGO), and Oracle (ORCL) each approach the recognition, dependency, or management of subscription revenue, and what does this reveal about their respective business models and financial predictability?",
      "answer": "Adobe (ADBE) directly discloses strong growth in subscription revenue, reaching $4.86 billion in fiscal 2024 with a 12% year-over-year increase, highlighting its reliance on a predictable, recurring revenue model. Broadcom (AVGO) indirectly emphasizes the volatility and risk associated with subscription and software license revenue, noting that fluctuations in this income stream can significantly impact operating results due to customer renewal uncertainty and contract structures. Oracle (ORCL) outlines a structured, ASC 606-compliant approach to recognizing subscription revenue from cloud services, typically recognized ratably over the contract period, reflecting a methodical and compliance-driven revenue recognition policy. Together, these perspectives reveal that while ADBE benefits from a highly scalable and predictable subscription model, AVGO faces more inherent volatility due to its mixed product and licensing model, and ORCL maintains a disciplined, long-term approach to recognizing cloud subscription revenue.",

We  have  made  significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments and our ex perienceled growth strategy.\n\nDigital Experience revenue was $5.37 billion in fiscal 2024, up from $4.89 billion in fiscal 2023, representing 10% year-over-year growth. Subscription revenue grew to $4.86 billion in fiscal 2024, up from $4.33 billion in fiscal 2023, representing 12% year-over-year growth.\n\n## Macroeconomic Conditions\n\nAs a corporation with an extensive global footprint, we are subject to risks and exposures from the evolving macroeconomic environment, including the effects of  increased  global  inflationary  pressures  and  interest  rates,  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  ex change  rates,  potential  economic  slowdowns  or  recessions  and geopolitical pressures, including the unknown impacts of current and future trade regulations. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results.\n\nWhile  our  revenue  and  earnings  are  relatively  predictable  as  a  result  of  our  subscription-based  business  model,  the  broader  implications  of  these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of these macroeconomic issues on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2024\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $17.33 billion as of November 29, 2024 increased by $2.00 billion, or 13%, from $15.33 billion as of December 1, 2023.\n- Creative revenue of $12.68 billion during fiscal 2024 increased by $1.17 billion, or 10%, from $11.52 billion in fiscal 2023. Document Cloud revenue of $3.18 billion during fiscal 2024 increased by $483 million, or 18%, from $2.70 billion in fiscal 2023.\n- Digital Ex perience revenue of $5.37 billion during fiscal 2024 increased by $473 million, or 10%, from $4.89 billion in fiscal 2023.\n- Cost of revenue of $2.36 billion during fiscal 2024 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2023.\n- Operating expenses of $12.41 billion during fiscal 2024 increased by $2.00 billion, or 19%, from $10.41 billion in fiscal 2023 primarily due to the $1 billion Figma termination fee incurred in fiscal 2024.\n- Net income of $5.56 billion during fiscal 2024 increased by $132 million, or 2%, from $5.43 billion in fiscal 2023.\n- Cash flows from operations of $8.06 billion during fiscal 2024 increased by $754 million, or 10%, from $7.30 billion in fiscal 2023.\n- Remaining performance obligations of $19.96 billion as of November 29, 2024 increased by $2.75 billion, or 16%, from $17.22 billion as of December 1, 2023.",

The failure or inability to renew customer agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow, or software license agreements without termination for convenience clauses could cause our operating results to fluctuate.\n\n## Our use of open source software in certain products and services could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\n\nMany of our products and services incorporate open source software, the use of which may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available. Open source licenses are generally 'as-is' and do not provide warranties, support or assurance of title or controls on origin, which may expose us to potential liability if the software fails to work or has security vulnerabilities.\n\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions and security vulnerabilities, we may receive third-party claims regarding our compliance with the conditions of such open source licenses and we may be required to take steps to remedy an alleged i nfringement or noncompliance, including modifying or releasing our product code or paying damages.\n\n## Our sales to government customers subject us to uncertainties and governmental regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur contracts signed with the U.S. federal, state and local government and non-U.S. government agencies are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of the government. Termination, renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a contract could adversely affect our sales, revenue and reputation. Additionally, our government contracts and our arrangements with channel partners who may sell directly to government customers are generally subject to requirements that may generally not be present in commercial contracts and/or may be complex, as well as audits and investigations. Failure to meet contractual requirements could result in various civil and criminal actions and penalties, and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\n\n## Failure to effectively manage our products and services lifecycles could harm our business.\n\nAs part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, customers are informed when products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. If these products or services remain subject to a service contract, the customer may transition to alternative products or services. Failure to effectively manage our products and services lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n## Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.\n\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this 'Risk Factors' section, these factors include, among others:\n\n- the timing of launches by our customers of new products in which our products are included and changes in end-user demand for our customers' products;\n- fl uctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers, which may lead to increased requests to delay shipment of our semiconductor products;\n- the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our semiconductor products for use in traditional enterprise data centers;\n- the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue;\n- the timing of new software contracts and renewals, including the timing of software contracts that do not have termination for convenience clauses;",

Pursuant to ASC 606, revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps:\n\n- i dentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n- i dentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- determination of the transaction price;\n- allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and\n- recognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nOur customers that contract with us for the provision of cloud services, software, hardware or other services include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices for cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud SaaS and cloud infrastructure contracts are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance. Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating expenses, net within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.\n\nOur revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant. Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services\n\nRevenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the cloud services are delivered, beginning on the date our service is made available to a customer. We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period. Revenues from cloud services that are provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer.",

      "question": "How do AVGO, MSFT, and ORCL each characterize their investment in research and development, and what does this reveal about their respective innovation strategies in enterprise software and cloud infrastructure?",
      "answer": "AVGO emphasizes that its research and development (R&D) expense is primarily driven by personnel costs for engineers working on product design and development, including stock-based compensation, and also includes project material costs, third-party consultant fees, and prototype development expenses. This suggests a focus on internal engineering and product development to support its enterprise software and cloud offerings. MSFT reports a significant R&D expense of $29,510 million in fiscal year 2024, showing a steady increase from prior years, which aligns with its strategy to continuously invest in innovation across its product and service portfolio, particularly in cloud and AI technologies. ORCL spent $6,690 million on R&D in fiscal year 2024, reflecting a modest 1% increase from the prior year, indicating a more measured approach to innovation investment, likely focused on optimizing existing cloud and database technologies. Collectively, these figures reveal that AVGO, MSFT, and ORCL take different strategic approaches to R&D investment\u2014AVGO with a focus on internal engineering, MSFT with aggressive scaling of innovation, and ORCL with a more conservative, efficiency-driven model.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. Our private cloud infrastructure suite of solutions are available directly from Broadcom, resellers and distributors, hyperscale cloud providers, value-added OEMs and VMware cloud service provider partners. VMware Cloud Foundation ('VCF') provides license portability, which enables customers to purchase subscriptions of VCF software and move their VCF environments between on-premises data centers and supported cloud endpoints. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe, VMware, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stockbased compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, and i nventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence.\n\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\n\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.\n\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\n\nSelling , general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs, which include direct transaction costs and integration costs, and other corporate expenses.\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D'), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with our acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&amp;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nRestructuring and other charges. Restructuring and other charges consist primarily of non-recurring charges related to compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, IP litigation, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalization of product development program costs, facility and l ease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&amp;D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt i s s uance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.\n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains and losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nProvision for income taxes. We benefit from the tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax i ncentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax i ncentives are scheduled",

These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses.\n\nCosts from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:\n\n- writing off some or all of the v alue of inv entory ;\n- recalling products that have been shipped;\n- providing product replacements or modifications;\n- providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;\n- defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages;\n- paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies; and\n- reputational harm.\n\nThese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue.

Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"M eltdown.\" A dditional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Security and manageability features in our products cannot make our products absolutely secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited.

Export restrictions may impede our ability to provide updates or patches to customers in certain geographies or that appear on sanctions lists, potentially leaving systems unpatched and open to exploitation. Further, sanctions lists may include third parties with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability disclosure, which may impair our ability to receive information about vulnerabilities and to deliver mitigations for them.

          "chunk_text": "## Contract Balances\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nA receivable is recorded when an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment exists, such that only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer. Included in trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been invoiced, and are typically related to license revenue or services which are delivered prior to invoicing. As of November 29, 2024, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $2.07 billion, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $66 million. As of December 1, 2023, the balance of trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $2.22 billion, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $80 million.\n\n## Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables and is based on both specific and general reserves. We maintain general reserves on a collective basis by considering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $14 million and $16 million as of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, respectively.\n\n## Contract Assets\n\nA contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration exists and transfer of control has occurred. Contract assets are typically related to subscription  and  hosted  service  contracts  where  the  transaction  price  allocated  to  the  satisfied  performance  obligations  ex ceeds  the  value  of  billings  to  date. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2024 and 2023. Contract assets were $248 million and $141 million as of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, respectively.\n\n## Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits.  Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced for these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The deferred  revenue  balance  is  influenced  by  several  factors,  including  the  compounding  effects  of  renewals,  invoice  duration,  invoice  timing,  size  and  new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, the balance of deferred revenue was $6.26 billion, which includes $83 million of refundable customer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation right for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time of cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services. Non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds related to these agreements comprised approximately 4% of the total deferred revenue.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## ADOBE INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)",

Unbilled receiv ables primarily represent work completed on dev elopment serv ices and on custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that hav e no alternativ e use to the Company at contract inception, recognized as rev enue but not yet inv oiced to customers.\n\n## Investments\n\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities. Inv estments in marketable debt securities are av ailable for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and are classified within current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Av ailable-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair  v alue,  with  the  change  in  unrealized  gains  and  losses,  net  of  tax,  reported  as  a  separate  component  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of Comprehensive Income until realized. Fair v alue is determined based on quoted market rates when observ able or utilizing data points that are observ able. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair v alue are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and  any  remaining  unrealized  losses,  net  of  tax,  are  included  in  Accumulated  other  comprehensiv e  income  (loss),  in  Consolidated  Statements  of Stockholders' Equity. The Company uses the first-in, first-out method as basis of the cost of securities sold.\n\nStrategic Non-marketable Equity Securities. The Company's investments in non-marketable securities of priv ately-held companies are held for long-term strategic purposes and are accounted for under the measurement alternativ e, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observ able price  changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when ev ents or circumstances indicate that a decline in v alue may hav e occurred.  The Company's  periodic  assessment  of  impairment  is  made  by  considering  av ailable  ev idence,  including  the  inv estee's  general  market  and  industry conditions and product dev elopment status. The Company also assesses the inv estee's ability to meet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the inv estee is using its cash, the inv estee's need for possible additional funding at a lower v aluation and any bona fide offer to purchase the inv estee.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company's financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair v alue on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity inv estments in priv ately-held companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternativ e.\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy\n\nThe fair v alue framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three lev els based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. T he guidance for fair v alue measurements requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair v alue be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) prices in activ e markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Lev el 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in activ e markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not activ e; or other inputs that are observ able or can be corroborated by observ able market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs to the v aluation methodology that are supported by little or no market activ ity and that are significant to the measurement of  the  fair  v alue  of  the  assets  or  liabilities.  Lev el  3  assets  and  liabilities  include  those  whose  fair  v alue  measurements  are  determined  using  pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar v aluation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are prov ided on a straight-line basis ov er the estimated useful liv es of two to 15 years for equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improv ements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic liv es of the improv ements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Investments\n\nThe Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company monitors and manages the overall exposure of its cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis. The Company's marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of investmentgrade securities and the Company's policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable for estimated credit losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.\n\nNo single customer accounted for ten percent or more of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located outside the Americas were 17 percent and 16 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located in the United States were 81 percent and 82 percent of total assets, respectively.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio, including within specific industries, as the Company primarily invests in enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators. As of January 31, 2025, the Company held four investments, all privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its total strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately 24 percent of the portfolio in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2024, the Company held two investments, both privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately 16 percent of the portfolio in the aggregate.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company's enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, 'Cloud Services'), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the basic subscription or software license sales. Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for process mapping, project management and implementation services and training services.\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\n\nThe Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:\n\n- identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n- identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- determination of the transaction price;\n- allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n- recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\n\nSubscription and Support Revenues\n\nSubscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement.\n\nCloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Substantially all of the Company's subscription service arrangements are noncancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\n\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II Item 8\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates prov ided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and serv ices separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relativ e SSP of the v arious products and serv ices.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observ able, such as when we do not sell the product or serv ice separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observ able inputs. We typically hav e more than one SSP for indiv idual products and serv ices due to the stratification of those products and serv ices by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the v arious benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of deliv ery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may prov ide other credits or incentiv es, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and serv ices, which are accounted for as v ariable consideration when determining the amount of rev enue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes av ailable. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\n## Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming of rev enue recognition may differ from the timing of inv oicing to customers. We record a receiv able when rev enue is recognized prior to inv oicing, or unearned rev enue when rev enue is recognized subsequent to inv oicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally inv oice customers annually at the beginning of each annual cov erage period. We record a receiv able related to rev enue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we hav e an unconditional right to inv oice and receiv e payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned rev enue related to v olume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud serv ices. Unearned rev enue is generally inv oiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably ov er the cov erage period. Unearned rev enue also includes payments for consulting serv ices to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-deliv ery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we hav e been paid in adv ance and earn the rev enue when we transfer control of the product or serv ice.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Rev enue for further information, including unearned rev enue by segment and changes in unearned rev enue during the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions v ary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of rev enue recognition differs from the timing of inv oicing, we hav e determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our inv oicing terms is to prov ide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and serv ices, not to receiv e financing from our customers or to prov ide customers with financing. Examples include inv oicing at the beginning of a subscription term with rev enue recognized ratably ov er the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are inv oiced annually with rev enue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, long-term accounts receiv able, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectiv ely, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receiv able balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently av ailable ev idence.",

      "answer": "AMD describes unbilled receivables as work completed on development services and semi-custom products under non-cancellable orders that have been recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced, emphasizing that these are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months. CSCO includes unbilled receivables in its aging analysis of financing receivables, indicating that unbilled amounts are part of contracts that are 31 days or more past due, which suggests a more conservative view of receivables tracking. QCOM quantifies its unbilled receivables at $1,435 million for fiscal year 2022, showing a significant increase from the prior year, which reflects growing contract activity or extended billing cycles. Together, these disclosures indicate differing approaches to unbilled receivables: AMD focuses on timing and recognition policy, CSCO integrates unbilled into past due risk assessment, and QCOM highlights a growing balance that may signal business expansion.",

          "chunk_text": "The Company first analyzes qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit  exceeds  its  carrying  amount.  Qualitative  factors  include  industry  and  market  considerations,  overall  financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nIf the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present  value  of  expected  future  cash  flows  to  determine  a  reporting  unit's  fair  value.  Significant  estimates  include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions.\n\nA goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nFrom time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and  federal  government  clean-up  activities  at  or  near  locations  where  the  Company  currently  or  has  in  the  past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nCash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Other investments in time deposits due within 12 months and marketable securities  are  included  in  short-term  investments.  Classification  of  marketable  securities  as  current  is  based  on  the Company's intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months.\n\n## Accounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivable  are  primarily  comprised  of  trade  receivables  presented  net  of  rebates,  price  protection  and  an allowance  for  credit  loss.  Accounts  receivable  also  include  unbilled  receivables,  which  primarily  represent  work completed  on  development  services  recognized  as  revenue  but  not  yet  invoiced  to  customers  and  semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months.\n\nThe  Company  manages  its  exposure  to  customer  credit  risk  through  credit  limits,  credit  lines,  ongoing  monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and,  at  intervals,  for  existing  customers.  From  this,  the  Company  may  require  letters  of  credit,  bank  or  corporate guarantees  or  advance  payments  if  deemed  necessary.  The  Company  maintains  an  allowance  for  credit  loss, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit risk.",

      "question": "How do Apple, AMD, and Oracle compare in their 2023 reporting of Other Non-Current Assets, and what might this reveal about their respective asset management strategies?",
      "answer": "Apple reported $46,906 million in Other Non-Current Assets for 2023, AMD reported $2,152 million, and Oracle reported $11,987 million. The significant differences in these figures suggest varying approaches to long-term asset allocation and investment strategies. Apple's large amount may reflect strategic investments or deferred tax-related assets, while AMD's smaller figure could indicate a more focused asset base aligned with its semiconductor manufacturing and R&D activities. Oracle's mid-range figure, despite its large overall asset base, may reflect a more streamlined or concentrated portfolio of long-term assets tied to its cloud and enterprise software infrastructure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AAPL \u2192 Other Non-Current Assets: Apple disclosed $46,906 million in Other Non-Current Assets in 2023, indicating a significant portion of its long-term asset base is categorized outside of traditional categories like property or goodwill.",
        "Hop 2: AMD \u2192 Other Non-Current Assets: AMD reported $2,152 million in Other Non-Current Assets in 2023, a relatively small portion of its total assets, suggesting a more focused or conservative approach to long-term asset diversification.",
        "Hop 3: ORCL \u2192 Other Non-Current Assets: Oracle disclosed $11,987 million in Other Non-Current Assets in 2023, which, while lower than Apple\u2019s figure, is still a meaningful component of its $134,384 million total asset base, potentially reflecting strategic investments or deferred tax assets tied to its global operations."

      "answer": "ADBE reported state net operating loss carryforwards of $408 million as of November 29, 2024, with no mention of specific expiration dates, though some carryforwards will expire between fiscal 2025 and 2040. MSFT disclosed $899 million in state net operating loss carryforwards as of June 30, 2024, with varying expiration dates ranging from fiscal 2025 to 2044. ORCL had significantly larger state net operating loss carryforwards at $2.1 billion as of May 31, 2024, with $2.0 billion expiring between fiscal 2025 and 2044 and $49 million without expiration dates. These differences suggest varying historical profitability and acquisition strategies, with ORCL having the largest carryforwards likely due to more extensive restructuring or acquisitions, while ADBE maintains a more moderate position with a significant portion of indefinite carryforwards.",

The net carrying amount of such assets is expected to be fully realized.\n\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax  assets, management determined that it is more likely than not that we will not fully realize certain available tax assets in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the ex tent it is more likely than not that they are not ex pected to be realized. As of November 29, 2024, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of $725 million primarily related to certain state credits and federal capital loss carryforwards.

      "question": "How do AVGO, CSCO, and MSFT differ in their allocation of capital toward purchases of investments in fiscal years 2022\u20132024, and what does this reveal about their respective investment strategies?",
      "answer": "AVGO has consistently maintained a conservative approach to investment purchases, with relatively low outflows\u2014$175 million in 2023 and $346 million in 2022. In contrast, CSCO showed a significant decrease in investment purchases from $10,871 million in 2023 to $4,230 million in 2024, indicating a strategic shift or market recalibration. MSFT, however, has been the most active among the three, with purchases of investments totaling $37,651 million in 2023 and $17,732 million in 2024, suggesting a more aggressive capital deployment strategy toward financial investments. These differences highlight AVGO\u2019s cautious stance, CSCO\u2019s reduced investment activity possibly tied to acquisitions or internal reallocation, and MSFT\u2019s broader financial market engagement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 Purchases of Investments: AVGO reported purchases of investments at $175 million in 2023 and $346 million in 2022, indicating a conservative investment posture.",

        "Hop 3: MSFT \u2192 Purchases of Investments: MSFT reported substantial purchases of investments at $37,651 million in 2023 and $17,732 million in 2024, reflecting a more active investment strategy."

      "answer": "Accenture highlights that cash flows from operations, combined with borrowing facilities, will fund its operations and strategic initiatives, including share repurchases of up to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2025. AMD states that cash flows from operations, along with credit facilities and commercial paper, will fund its operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, including the strategic acquisition of Silo AI and ZT Systems. Qualcomm, despite strong operating cash flows, experienced a negative impact on cash flows due to higher tax payments, including $1.0 billion from the capitalization of R&D expenses, which constrained its ability to deploy capital as freely as in prior years. Together, these perspectives show that while all three rely on operating cash flows for strategic investments, they differ in how external constraints and internal priorities shape their capital deployment strategies.",

For additional information, see Note 6 (Business Combinations and Dispositions) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nFinancing activities: The $418 million increase in cash used was due to higher cash dividends paid and net purchases of shares, as well as higher purchases of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by higher net proceeds from borrowings. For additional information, see Note 14 (Shareholders' Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nWe believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities.\n\nSubstantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally  div idend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.\n\n## Share Purchases and Redemptions\n\nWe intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2025. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity , general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion.

The net increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities and $383 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock (primarily under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan), partially offset by $4.1 billion in payments to repurchase shares of our common stock, $3.7 billion in cash dividends paid, $1.0 billion in capital ex penditures, $932 million in payments of tax withholdings related to the vesting of share-based awards and $914 million in repayments of notes that matured in May 2024.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, income taxes paid were in excess of our provision, negatively impacting net cash provided by operating activities. This was primarily driven by the adverse impact of the requirement to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures for federal income tax purposes, our payment of $1.0 billion related to certain previously postponed U.S. federal income tax payments from fiscal 2023 and an installment payment for a one-time U.S. repatriation tax accrued in fiscal 2018 of $414 million.\n\nNet changes in our operating assets and liabilities positively impacted our operating cash flows in fiscal 2024 primarily from an increase in accrued customer incentives, which included the impact of timing of related payments, and an increase in accounts payable due to timing and amount of inventory purchases, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues.\n\nDebt. At September 29, 2024, we had $15.0 billion of principal fix ed-rate notes outstanding, $1.4 billion of which matures in May 2025. The remaining debt has maturity dates in 2027 through 2053.\n\nWe have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $4.5 billion of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At September 29, 2024, we had no amounts of commercial paper outstanding. On August 8, 2024, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility, replacing our prior Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 billion, which ex pires on August 8, 2029. At September 29, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nWe expect to issue new debt in the future. The amount and timing of any such new debt will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to maturities of our existing debt, acquisitions and strategic investments, favorable and/or acceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law. Additional information regarding our outstanding debt at September 29, 2024 is provided in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. Debt.'\n\nIncome Taxes. At September 29, 2024, our remaining future payments were $1.0 billion for a one-time U.S. repatriation tax  accrued in fiscal 2018, after application of certain tax  credits, which is payable in installments over the nex t two years. At September 29, 2024, other current liabilities included $530 million for the nex t installment due in January 2025. Beginning in fiscal 2023, for federal income tax  purposes, we are required to capitalize and amortize domestic research and development expenditures over five years and foreign research and development expenditures over fifteen years (such expenditures were previously deducted as incurred). As a result, our cash flows from operations are adversely affected due to significantly higher cash tax payments. However, the adverse cash flow impact will diminish in future years as capitalized research and",

      "answer": "ADBE reported $13.99 billion in remaining performance obligations as of December 3, 2021, with approximately 72% expected to be recognized within the next 12 months. AVGO disclosed $23.6 billion in remaining performance obligations as of October 30, 2022, with about 28% expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, primarily from multi-year semiconductor contracts. ORCL had $46.6 billion in remaining performance obligations as of May 31, 2022, with approximately 57% expected to be recognized within the next 12 months and 32% over months 13 to 36. These differences suggest that ADBE has a relatively short-duration contract base with high near-term revenue visibility, AVGO has longer-duration semiconductor contracts but limited recognition due to contract structure, and ORCL has a more extended and diversified revenue recognition profile across its enterprise customer base.",

Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60  days.  In  instances  where  the  timing  of  revenue  recognition  differs  from  the  timing  of  invoicing,  we  have  determined  our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\n\nAs  of  December  3,  2021,  the  balance  of  deferred  revenue  was  $4.88  billion,  which  includes  $88  million  of  refundable customer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation right for  which  we  are  obligated  to  refund  amounts  paid  related  to  products  or  services  not  yet  delivered  or  provided  at  the  time  of cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products  or  services.  Non-cancellable  and  non-refundable  committed  funds  related  to  these  agreements  comprised approximately 5% of the total deferred revenue.\n\nAs of November 27, 2020, the balance of deferred revenue was $3.76 billion. Significant movements in the deferred revenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying performance obligations  to  the  customer  and  deferred  revenue  assumed  through  acquisition,  which  were  offset  by  decreases  due  to  revenue recognized in the period. During the year ended December 3, 2021, approximately $3.55 billion of revenue was recognized that was included in the balance of deferred revenue as of November 27, 2020.\n\nTransaction  price  allocated  to  remaining  performance  obligations  represents  contracted  revenue  that  has  not  yet  been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several factors, including the timing of renewals and average contract term. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that are billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based royalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint.\n\nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021. Non-cancellable and nonrefundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above comprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining performance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the next 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\n\n## Contract Acquisition Costs\n\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized.\n\nThe costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel. Capitalized costs may also include portions of fringe benefits and payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs to acquire customer contracts and incentive payments to partners.\n\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis,  to  be  5  years.  Amortization  of  capitalized  costs  are  included  in  sales  and  marketing  expense  in  our  Consolidated Statements  of  Income.  During  fiscal  2021  and  2020,  we  amortized  $212  million  and  $186  million  of  capitalized  contract acquisition costs into sales and marketing expense, respectively. We did not incur any impairment losses in fiscal 2021 and 2020.\n\nCapitalized contract acquisition costs were $611 million and $530 million as of December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020, of which $406 million and $352 million was long-term and included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,",

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. The majority of our customer software contracts include termination for convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are not considered committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usagebased royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions segment contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of October 30, 2022 were approximately $23.6 billion. We expect approximately 28% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Although the majority of our software contracts are not deemed to be committed, our customers generally do not exercise their termination for convenience rights. In addition, the majority of our contracts for products, subscriptions and services have a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods.\n\n## 4. Acquisitions\n\n## Pending Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 'VMware Merger Agreement') to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger') that values VMware at approximately $61 billion based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash.\n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger.\n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware RSU awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.\n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors.\n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion.\n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $1.5 billion.",

The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2021 and 2020,  respectively,  was  approximately  $8.8  billion  and  $8.0  billion,  respectively.  Revenues  recognized  from  performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues  that  we  recognize  are  impacted  by  a  variety  of  seasonal  factors.  In  each  fiscal  year,  the  amounts  and  volumes  of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. These  seasonal  impacts  influence  how  our  remaining  performance  obligations  change  over  time  and,  combined  with  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2022, our remaining performance obligations were $46.6 billion, approximately 57% of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months, 32% over the subsequent month 13 to month 36, and the remainder thereafter.\n\n## Sales of Financing Receivables\n\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis  to  financial  institutions  within  90  days  of  the  contracts'  dates  of  execution. We  record  the  transfers  of  amounts  due  from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated  set  of  assets  and  activities  that  is  capable  of  being  conducted  and  managed  for  the  purpose  of  providing  a  return  to investors.  Asset  acquisitions  are  accounted  for  by  allocating  the  cost  of  the  acquisition  to  the  individual  assets  and  liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date  fair  values.  Goodwill  as  of  the  business  acquisition  date  is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of  a  business  acquisition's  measurement  period  or  final  determination  of  the  values  of  assets  acquired  or  liabilities  assumed, whichever  comes  first,  any  subsequent  adjustments  are  recorded  to  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Costs  to  exit  or restructure  certain  activities  of  an  acquired  company  or  our  internal  operations  are  accounted  for  as  termination  and  exit  costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , and are accounted for separately from the business",

      "question": "How do Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), and Qualcomm (QCOM) each assess the financial and operational risks associated with excess inventory, and what do their disclosures reveal about their respective exposure to supply-demand imbalances in 2023?",
      "answer": "Intel (INTC) disclosed that it uses demand forecasts to determine obsolete or excess inventory, particularly for new products with limited historical data, and writes off excess inventory when demand forecasts exceed actual demand. Microsoft (MSFT) noted that excess or obsolete inventory could increase its cost of revenue due to component shortages or supply chain disruptions, particularly in datacenter server production. Qualcomm (QCOM) revealed that if customer demand forecasts are not met with binding commitments and demand does not materialize, it may incur increased inventory costs and record impairment charges. Collectively, these disclosures indicate that all three companies face significant exposure to supply-demand mismatches, but with different focal points: Intel emphasizes demand forecasting challenges, Microsoft highlights component availability and supply constraints, and Qualcomm stresses customer commitment risk and inventory impairment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n## Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis  and  in  conjunction  with  its  underlying  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  exposures.  Given  the  effective  horizons  of  the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in  U.S.  interest  rates  affect  the  interest  earned  on  the  Company's  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  and  the  fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company's debt.\n\nThe Company's investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company's liquidity requirements.  The  Company  uses  a  combination  of  internal  and  external  management  to  execute  its  investment  strategy  and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company's investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs  of  September  24,  2022,  the  Company  had  outstanding  fixed-rate  notes  and  as  of  September  25,  2021,  the  Company  had outstanding  floating-  and  fixed-rate  notes  with  varying  maturities  for  an  aggregate  carrying  amount  of  $110.1  billion  and  $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its  outstanding  term  debt.  Interest  rate  swaps  allow  the  Company  to  effectively  convert  fixed-rate  payments  into  floating-rate payments  or  floating-rate  payments  into  fixed-rate  payments.  Gains  and  losses  on  term  debt  are  generally  offset  by  the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company's debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe  Company  may  enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  with  financial  institutions  to  protect  against  foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency  contracts  to  partially  offset  the  foreign  currency  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  its  foreign  currency-denominated  debt issuances.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its  forecasted  foreign  currency  exposure  associated  with  revenue  and inventory  purchases,  typically  for  up  to  12  months.  However,  the  Company  may  choose  not  to  hedge  certain  foreign  exchange exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of supply chain challenges. More typically, however, to ensure the availability of our semiconductor products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.\n\nConversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. If we are unable to meet such increases in demand, this could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins'. These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. A delay or cancellation of a customer's plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins at the same time, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses. Further, often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing line for those products. The qualification process can take significant time and resources. Delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue. Finally, customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products, and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles.\n\n## Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.\n\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new delivery methods. We expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets.\n\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, a larger installed customer base, larger technical staffs, more established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and development, technical and marketing resources than us. We also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry, open source authors who provide software and IP for free, competitors who offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models, and customers who develop competing products.\n\nIn addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape. We expect this trend to continue, which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us. Some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better patent protection than us.\n\nThe actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us. Further, competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technical information, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",

We experienced strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, partially offset by lower notebook ASPs due to strength in the consumer and education market segments. DCG was down on lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive environment, partially offset by higher platform  volume from recovery in the enterprise and government market segment. IOTG and Mobileye both achieved strong results on higher demand amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19. We invested $15.2 billion in R&amp;D, made capital investments of $18.7 billion, and generated $30.0 billion in cash from operations and $11.3 billion of free cash flow. 1\n\n\"We achieved solid results amid a highly constrained industry-wide supply environment while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position.

Free cash flow decreased due to lower operating cash flow and higher capital expenditures.\n\n## Investing in our IDM 2.0 strategy for the long term\n\nTo support our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are making significant capital investments to increase our manufacturing capacity and accelerate our process technology roadmap, as well as increasing our investments in R&amp;D. We believe these investments will position us for accelerating long-term revenue growth. We expect our long-term revenue outlook to accelerate to a 10% to 12% year-over-year growth rate by the end of our five-year horizon as supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products. We expect gross margins to be impacted by our investments in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, resulting in expected non-GAAP gross margins percentages between 51% and 53%  over the next several years before moving upward. We also expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. We expect our cash from operations to be strong, but our capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term. 2\n\n- See \"Our Products\" within MD&amp;A. 1\n- See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&amp;A. 2",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. Our private cloud infrastructure suite of solutions are available directly from Broadcom, resellers and distributors, hyperscale cloud providers, value-added OEMs and VMware cloud service provider partners. VMware Cloud Foundation ('VCF') provides license portability, which enables customers to purchase subscriptions of VCF software and move their VCF environments between on-premises data centers and supported cloud endpoints. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe, VMware, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stockbased compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, and i nventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence.\n\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\n\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.\n\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\n\nSelling , general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs, which include direct transaction costs and integration costs, and other corporate expenses.\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D'), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with our acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&amp;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nRestructuring and other charges. Restructuring and other charges consist primarily of non-recurring charges related to compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, IP litigation, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalization of product development program costs, facility and l ease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&amp;D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt i s s uance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.\n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains and losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nProvision for income taxes. We benefit from the tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax i ncentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax i ncentives are scheduled",

Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. Risks described with respect to new product development also apply to acquisitions.\n\n## Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations.\n\nAs we focus on new market opportunities and key priority areas, such as AI, cloud, and cybersecurity, we compete with companies of all sizes. Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Additionally, as customers complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively  compete for these market opportunities.  Further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. For example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.\n\nWe produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software typically contains bugs or other quality or reliability problems that can unex pectedly interfere with its intended operations or the intended operation of the systems in which our software is installed. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment or pre-release testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect or bug could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, product reengineering expenses or legal liability, any of which could materially harm our revenue, margins, and net income.\n\n## Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition.\n\nWe conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. We also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. Our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in certain prior periods. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. Our future results could be negatively impacted by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, any or all of which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition, including the following: impacts from",

These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our A I cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\n\n## Risks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\n\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately , has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\n\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the  semiconductor  industry  and/or  limited  supply  or  capacity  in  our  supply  chain,  the  lead  times  for  certain  supply   may   be  ex tended.  W e  hav e  prev iously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. T o secure future supply and capacity , we have paid premiums, provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs.\n\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory , significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and contract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply , we may not be able to meet increased customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share. A dditionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties.\n\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly . We have had to reduce average selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers' increase in prices, write down our inventory , incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may have to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. A ll of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\n\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, include:\n\n- changes in product development cycles and time to market;\n- competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\n- changes in business and economic conditions;\n- sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\n- rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n- the availability  of sufficient data center capacity  or energy  for customers to procure;\n- new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n- new or unexpected end-use cases;\n- increase in demand for competitive products;\n- changes in end-user demand;",

QCOM shows a similar upward trend, with Cost of Revenues rising from $61 million in 2022 to $76 million in 2023, a 24.6% increase. MSFT, while not providing a direct dollar figure, discusses how inventory and cost of revenue are impacted by valuation adjustments and write-downs to net realizable value, suggesting a more variable cost structure tied to product mix and inventory management.

If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceiv ed security v ulnerabilities in our products and serv ices, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to serv ices, or to use competing products or serv ices. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or serv ices. Customers in certain industries such as financial serv ices, health care, and gov ernment may hav e enhanced or specialized expectations and requirements to which we must engineer our products and serv ices. Customers and third parties granted access to their systems may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices Any of these could adv ersely affect our reputation and results of operations. Actual or perceiv ed v ulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain prov isions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these prov isions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achiev e commercial objectiv es, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.\n\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security v ulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we may experience adv erse impacts to our results of operations, reputation, or competitiv e position.\n\nDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches prov ides ev idence of an external env ironment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improv e the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls ov er personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prev ent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our v endors store and manage. Relatedly, despite our efforts to continuously improv e security controls, it is possible that we may fail to identify or mitigate insider threat activ ities that could lead to the misuse of our systems or customer and user data. In addition, third parties who hav e limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of rev enue. Our software products and serv ices also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or in a cloud-based env ironment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to v alid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on gov ernment authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or serv ices and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and gov ernment entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or gov ernmental rules or actions, may increase costs or hinder sales of our products and serv ices.\n\nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and serv ices contain v aluable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we hav e made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prev ent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",

Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. If any parties with whom we conduct business or invest our cash or cash equivalents are unable to meet their obligations to us, our business could be adversely affected. Bank failures or issues in the broader U.S. or global financial systems may have an impact on the broader capital markets and, in turn, our ability to access those markets.\n\nIn addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise license, hardware and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.\n\nBusiness disruptions could adversely affect our operating results. A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas, some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the U.S. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems, supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, including some of our cloud offerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back-office processes. Although the Oracle Cloud is designed to automatically redirect traffic to an alternate facility, in the event of a severe impact to one facility, a major natural disaster, political, social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change (such as i ncreased storm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations, supply chains or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity\n\nOur overall information security risk management approach is designed to enable us to assess, identify and manage major risk exposures, including from material risks from cybersecurity threats, in a timely manner. As part of our information security risk management program, we perform risk assessments in which we map and prioritize information security risks identified through the processes described below. These assessments inform our information security risk management strategies and oversight processes and we view cybersecurity risks as one of the key risk categories we face.\n\nWe believe that Oracle is a target for computer hackers, cyber threats and other bad actors because our products and services store, retrieve, process and manage large amounts of data, including sensitive data. We and our vendors are regularly subject to attempts by third parties to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers', partners' and suppliers' software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems. During fiscal 2024, we did not identify any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, i f a  cyberattack or other security incident results in unauthorized access to or modification or exfiltration of our customers' or suppliers' data, other external data, our own data or our IT systems, or if the services we provide to our customers are disrupted, or",

We may also underestimate the costs of, or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from, these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns.\n\nFor example, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs. Additionally, certain customers have adopted, and other customers may adopt, policies that require us to achieve certain sustainability, climate or other environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related targets, such as our 2040 net-zero global GHG emissions commitment and our interim GHG emissions reduction goals. If we fail to achieve ESG-related targets that meet our customers' requirements or expectations, these customers may not purchase products or services from us.\n\nIf our products fail to perform to specifications, compete with the product quality of our competitors or meet quality or regulatory standards (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry) or other standards (including sustainability or other ESG-related standards) of a particular industry or application, we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that industry or application, and our growth could be limited.\n\nIn addition, in order to successfully ex tend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models or transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.\n\nIf we are not successful in ex tending our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, if our new technologies and products are not successful, or if we are not successful in the time frames we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and asset impairments, our business and revenues may not grow or grow as anticipated, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted, our stock price may decline and our reputation may be harmed.\n\n## We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.\n\nWe engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business. We routinely acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions, and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies, supporting the design and introduction of new products (or enhancing existing products) for mobile handsets, and furthering our growth and diversification strategy in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not be successful, generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or products. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership or variable interests. In addition, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, impairment or other charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.\n\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from acquired technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may become subject to liabilities, including liabilities arising as a result of litigation, that are not covered by any indemnification protection that we may obtain. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models, geographic regions, industries and applications served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of our strategic acquisitions.",

      "answer": "Cisco (CSCO) highlights that increased purchase commitments are a result of supply chain challenges and efforts to shorten lead times, which could lead to excess inventory charges or margin pressure if demand declines. Microsoft (MSFT) discloses $72.022 billion in total purchase commitments, indicating significant forward-looking obligations that are part of its broader capital and operational commitments. Qualcomm (QCOM) reports $12.8 billion in total purchase obligations, with $9.6 billion expected to be paid in the next 12 months, including multi-year capacity commitments with suppliers that carry penalties for cancellation or underutilization. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies face material purchase commitments, CSCO emphasizes demand volatility and margin risk, MSFT shows large-scale procurement tied to long-term infrastructure and product development, and QCOM focuses on semiconductor-specific supplier commitments with contractual penalties, reflecting differing supply chain dependencies and strategic positioning in the tech ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\npolicy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world (including as a result of the on-going Russia and Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war, and  China-Taiwan  relations),  the  current  economic  challenges  in  China,  including  global  economic  ramifications  of  Chinese  economic  difficulties,  and  other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, were to deteriorate, we may experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nOur operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular  customer  markets  within  that  segment.  In  addition,  reports  of  certain  intelligence  gathering  methods  of  the  U.S.  government  could  affect  customers' perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are critical to the development and growth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have a negative impact on our operating results.\n\n## Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\n\nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, which can be ex acerbated during periods when the global macroenvironment is challenging and inconsistent and can result in market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods, or decline as it did in fiscal 2024 and certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial ex pectations could also be negatively impacted if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we experienced a decline in product demand resulting in a decrease of revenue as customers continued to scrutinize spend as they needed additional time to implement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. We have also experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be negatively impacted if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.\n\nThe timing of large orders can also have a significant impact on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. Longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past have caused, and in the future could cause, some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product, or to also place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along  with  other  factors)  or  risk  of  order  cancellation  may  cause  difficulty  in  predicting  our  revenue.  Further,  our  efforts  to  improve  manufacturing  lead-time performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing component supply-related challenges, we have in the past and may in the future increase our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to potential material ex cess and obsolete inventory charges or other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods if product demand significantly decreases for a sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or we are unable to continue to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures. Product demand conditions for future periods can be difficult to predict or may persist longer than anticipated. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes. Any of the above factors could materially harm our operations and financial results. For additional information and a further discussion of impacts and risks related to our inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see 'Results of Operations-Product Gross  Margin-Supply Chain Impacts and Risks', 'Liquidity and  Capital  Resources-Inventory  Supply  Chain' under  Item 7 and  Note 14 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.",

We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments.

      "answer": "AVGO defines purchase commitments as unconditional obligations primarily for inventory, specifying fixed or minimum quantities, pricing, and timing, while excluding short-term or cancelable agreements. CSCO highlights that increased inventory and purchase commitments are a result of efforts to shorten manufacturing lead times, which could lead to excess inventory charges or margin pressure if demand declines. QCOM discloses $12.8 billion in total purchase obligations as of September 29, 2024, with $9.6 billion expected to be paid within 12 months, including multi-year capacity commitments with suppliers that may carry penalties for underutilization or cancellations. Comparing these, AVGO focuses on disclosure clarity and classification, CSCO emphasizes demand volatility and its impact on commitments, and QCOM reveals significant near-term financial exposure tied to long-term supplier agreements.",

If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, were to deteriorate, we may experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nOur operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular  customer  markets  within  that  segment.  In  addition,  reports  of  certain  intelligence  gathering  methods  of  the  U.S.  government  could  affect  customers' perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are critical to the development and growth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have a negative impact on our operating results.\n\n## Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\n\nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, which can be ex acerbated during periods when the global macroenvironment is challenging and inconsistent and can result in market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods, or decline as it did in fiscal 2024 and certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial ex pectations could also be negatively impacted if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we experienced a decline in product demand resulting in a decrease of revenue as customers continued to scrutinize spend as they needed additional time to implement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. We have also experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be negatively impacted if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.\n\nThe timing of large orders can also have a significant impact on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. Longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past have caused, and in the future could cause, some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product, or to also place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along  with  other  factors)  or  risk  of  order  cancellation  may  cause  difficulty  in  predicting  our  revenue.  Further,  our  efforts  to  improve  manufacturing  lead-time performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing component supply-related challenges, we have in the past and may in the future increase our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to potential material ex cess and obsolete inventory charges or other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods if product demand significantly decreases for a sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or we are unable to continue to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures. Product demand conditions for future periods can be difficult to predict or may persist longer than anticipated. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes. Any of the above factors could materially harm our operations and financial results. For additional information and a further discussion of impacts and risks related to our inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see 'Results of Operations-Product Gross  Margin-Supply Chain Impacts and Risks', 'Liquidity and  Capital  Resources-Inventory  Supply  Chain' under  Item 7 and  Note 14 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.",

Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments.

Customers for these license support and cloud services agreements are generally billed in advance of services being provided. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also generate cash from the sales of new licenses, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2024 relative to fiscal 2023 primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by certain cash unfavorable working capital changes, net.\n\nCash flows from investing activities : The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities and other instruments and investments in capital assets primarily to support the growth in our cloud and license business.\n\nNet cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2024 relative to fiscal 2023 primarily due to the decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and lower capital expenditures.\n\nCash flows from financing activities : The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt i nstruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.\n\nNet cash used for financing activities was $10.6 billion during fiscal 2024 compared to the net cash provided by financing activities of $7.9 billion in fiscal 2023. The increase in net cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the absence of the cash proceeds from borrowings pursuant to the issuance of senior notes and Term Loan Credit Agreement, higher repayments of commercial paper notes, net of issuances, higher net cash used for our employee stock programs and higher dividend payments, partially offset by lower maturities of senior notes and lower stock repurchases, in each case in fiscal 2024 relative to fi s cal 2023. During fiscal 2023 we borrowed $15.7 billion pursuant to the Bridge Credit Agreement, which was fully repaid within fiscal 2023.\n\nFree cash flow : To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with that of our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How have Adobe, Cisco, and Intel each approached their cash dividend policies in recent years, and what does this reveal about their differing capital allocation strategies?",
      "answer": "Adobe has explicitly stated that it does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, focusing instead on stock repurchases and reinvestment in growth opportunities. Cisco has consistently declared cash dividends, with amounts of $1.50, $1.54, and $1.58 per share in recent fiscal years, reflecting a steady and increasing payout to shareholders. Intel has also declared cash dividends, but with a declining trend, decreasing from $1.46 per share in 2022 to $0.74 in 2023 and $0.38 in 2024, signaling financial pressure and a need to conserve cash. These differences highlight Adobe\u2019s growth-oriented strategy, Cisco\u2019s mature and stable capital return approach, and Intel\u2019s recent shift toward financial caution amid operational challenges.",

      "answer": "Adobe reported a 16% year-over-year increase in remaining performance obligations, reaching $19.96 billion as of November 29, 2024, indicating strong forward-looking revenue visibility from its subscription-based model. NVIDIA disclosed $1.7 billion in remaining performance obligations from contracts greater than one year in length as of January 26, 2025, with approximately 39% expected to be recognized in the next twelve months, suggesting a more project-based or cyclical revenue pattern. Oracle had $97.9 billion in remaining performance obligations as of May 31, 2024, with 39% expected to be recognized in the next twelve months, reflecting a large, diversified customer base with long-term contracts and seasonal revenue concentration. The comparison reveals Adobe\u2019s high predictability due to recurring revenue, NVIDIA\u2019s exposure to multi-year contract fulfillment cycles, and Oracle\u2019s enterprise-scale, long-duration contract structure.",

We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results.\n\nWhile  our  revenue  and  earnings  are  relatively  predictable  as  a  result  of  our  subscription-based  business  model,  the  broader  implications  of  these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain.

For our foreign currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or expense.\n\nThe table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## I ndex to Financial Statements\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations from Contracts with Customers\n\nTrade receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2024 and 2023. The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was approximately $9.0 billion and $8.3 billion. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been i s s ued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. In each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fi s cal quarter. These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and, combined with foreign exchange rate fl uctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were $97.9 billion, of which we expect to recognize approximately 39% as revenues over the next twelve months, 36% over the subsequent month 13 to month 36, 19% over the subsequent month 37 to month 60 and the remainder thereafter.\n\n## Sales of Financing Receivables\n\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts' dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, $1.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition's measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred.",

Texas Instruments bought back 2,753,196 shares in the last quarter of 2024 at prices between $191.23 and $203.84, maintaining over $20 billion in remaining repurchase capacity throughout.

      "answer": "AVGO declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share in December 2024, payable in the same month, indicating a consistent and predictable shareholder return policy. CRM, for the first time in its history, announced a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share in February 2024, signaling a strategic shift toward returning capital to shareholders. QCOM announced a higher dividend of $0.85 per share in October 2024, payable in December 2024, suggesting strong cash flow generation and a more aggressive return-of-capital strategy. Collectively, these actions reflect varying stages and intensities of maturity in capital allocation policies across the three tech firms.",

      "answer": "Broadcom (AVGO) compares its stock performance against the S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ 100 Index over the five fiscal years ended November 3, 2024, emphasizing that the data is historical and not indicative of future performance. Salesforce (CRM) provides a broader comparison, including the S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq Computer & Data Processing Index, Nasdaq 100 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the five fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, noting that the data is not to be incorporated by reference into other filings. Intel (INTC) compares its total shareholder return (TSR) against the S&P 100 Index, S&P 500 Index, S&P 500 IT Index, and the SOX Index over the five years ended December 28, 2024, based on its fiscal calendar. Collectively, these disclosures show that while all three companies use the S&P 500 as a benchmark, they differ in the breadth of comparative indices and framing of the data\u2019s relevance, reflecting distinct approaches to investor transparency and risk communication.",

Furthermore, governments' responses to macroeconomic factors and tax revenue needs may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and financial results.\n\n## We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies.\n\nWe primarily conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including in emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency ex change rates, combined with the seasonality of our business, could affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.\n\nAdditionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including the war in Ukraine and regional conflict in the Middle East, fluctuating commodity prices, uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy and inflation, have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which has and could in the future amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Our debt service obligations, lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had a substantial level of outstanding debt, including our Senior Notes. We are also party to the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for our $5.0 billion Credit Facility. Although there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2025, we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.\n\nIn addition to the outstanding and potential debt obligations above, we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with noncancellable future payments on our long-term lease agreements. We also have significant other contractual commitments, including leases that have not yet commenced and commitments with infrastructure service providers, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could:\n\n- impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital ex penditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n- cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments; and\n- make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\n\nOur ability to meet our ex penses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business.\n\nIn addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit ratings may negatively impact our reputation, the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\n\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in",

Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies, and exchange rate fluctuations in those jurisdictions may impact our effectiv e tax rate.\n\nOur balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, which are based on year-end 2024 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relativ e to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of less than $1 million.\n\nWe use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may hav e on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2024, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional v alue of $565 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $180 million to buy Indian rupee, $91 million to sell British pounds and $78 million to sell Japanese yen). Similar hedging activ ities existed at year-end 2023.\n\n## Interest rate ris k\n\nWe have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair v alue of our inv estments in cash equiv alents and short-term inv estments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair v alue of our debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair v alue of our inv estments in cash equiv alents and short-term inv estments by about $22 million and decrease the fair v alue of our long-term debt by $952 million. Because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt.",

      "answer": "Accenture repurchased $4.5 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2024, framing share repurchases as part of a broader capital return strategy alongside dividends. Microsoft executed over 6.6 million share repurchases across Q1\u2013Q3 of 2024 at an average price above $400, signaling consistent and measured buyback activity under a public repurchase plan. NVIDIA significantly ramped up its repurchase activity, buying back $34.0 billion in shares during fiscal 2025 (which overlaps with parts of 2024), indicating a more aggressive capital return approach aligned with its strong cash flow generation. The comparative scale and tone suggest that NVIDIA is prioritizing shareholder returns more heavily relative to its peers, while Accenture balances buybacks with dividends, and Microsoft maintains a steady, transparent repurchase cadence.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in 'Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe use the terms 'Accenture,' 'we,' 'our' and 'us' in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to 'fiscal 2024' means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2024. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.\n\nWe use the term 'in local currency' so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results 'in local currency' are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results  where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\n\n## Overview\n\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy &amp; Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X  and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North A merica, EM EA  (Europe, M iddle East and A frica) and Growth M arkets (A sia Pacific and Latin A merica). We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and A I with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world's leading organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance services-creating tangible value at speed and scale. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our Latin A merica market unit will move from Growth M arkets to North America. With this change, North A merica will become the A mericas market and Growth M arkets will become the A sia Pacific market.\n\nOur results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. These conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending, particularly for smaller contracts with a shorter duration and for our consulting services. Clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue over a longer period.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nKey metrics for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 are included below. We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or 'adjusted' basis to exclude the impact of $438 million and $1,063 million, respectively, in business optimization costs recorded during fiscal 2024 and 2023 and, with respect to effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share, the impact of a $253 million investment gain related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies recorded during fiscal 2023 as discussed further in our Results of Operations. For additional information regarding business optimization costs, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n- Revenues of $64.9 billion, an increase of 1% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency;\n- New bookings of $81.2 billion, an increase of 13% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency;\n- Operating margin of 14.8% , compared to 13.7% in fiscal 2023; adjusted operating margin was 15.5% compared to 15.4% in fiscal 2023;\n- Diluted earnings per share of $11.44, a 6% increase over $10.77 for fiscal 2023; adjusted earnings per share increased 2% to $11.95 compared to $11.67 for fiscal 2023; and\n- Cash returned to shareholders of $7.8 billion, including share purchases of $4.5 billion and dividends of $3.2 billion.",

A s of January 26, 2025, we had $43.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\n\nOur marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV , Item 15 of this A nnual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nExcept for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at the end of fiscal y ear 2025 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\n\n## Capital Return to Shareholders\n\nOn August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase authorization, without expiration. In fiscal year 2025, we repurchased  310  million  shares  of  our  common  stock  for  $34.0  billion. A s  of  January  26,  2025,  we  were  authorized,  subject  to  certain  specifications,  to repurchase up to $38.7 billion of our common stock.\n\nFrom January 27, 2025 through February 21, 2025, we repurchased 29 million shares for $3.7 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.\n\nIn fiscal y ear 2025, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $834 million. The payment of future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.\n\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction A ct of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost and was not material for fiscal years 2025 and 2024.\n\n## Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\n\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January 26, 2025, by year payable, are as follows:\n\n",

T o the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.

      "question": "How do ACN's strategic investments in AI and innovation, CRM's structured disclosures of strategic investments, and INTC's $20.4 billion capital expenditure commitments for 2024 collectively reflect distinct strategic priorities and risk profiles in their approach to future growth?",
      "answer": "ACN emphasizes strategic investments in AI, robotics, and innovation to drive expansion into new growth areas, acknowledging the risks of rapid technological change and the need to maintain competitive advantage through continuous investment. CRM provides structured disclosures of its strategic investments by form and measurement category, suggesting a transparent and disciplined financial approach to managing these investments. INTC, in contrast, highlights a concrete $20.4 billion in capital expenditure commitments for 2024, focused on expanding manufacturing capabilities in key global regions, signaling a heavy emphasis on physical infrastructure and long-term capacity building. Together, these approaches reflect distinct strategic priorities: ACN leans into innovation-driven service expansion, CRM into financial transparency and asset management, and INTC into large-scale capital-intensive manufacturing growth. This divergence suggests different risk profiles\u2014ACN faces innovation and market adoption risks, CRM faces execution and valuation risks tied to investment structures, and INTC faces capital efficiency and geopolitical risks across its global footprint.",

      "question": "How do Cisco (CSCO), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) each quantify or describe the financial risks associated with excess inventory, and what does this reveal about their respective exposure to supply chain volatility in 2023?",
      "answer": "Cisco (CSCO) highlights that increased inventory and purchase commitments made during supply constraints could lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charges, which could negatively impact product gross margin if demand decreases or supply chain exposures persist. Intel (INTC) explains that excess inventory write-offs occur when demand forecasts exceed actual demand, and it uses a demand forecast to determine obsolete or excess inventory levels, particularly for new products with limited historical data. Qualcomm (QCOM) notes that if demand forecasts from customers are not covered by binding commitments and fail to materialize, it may incur increased inventory and manufacturing costs, including charges for excess or obsolete inventory. Collectively, this shows that all three companies face similar supply chain volatility risks, but differ in how they model and disclose the financial impact\u2014Cisco emphasizes gross margin risk, Intel focuses on forecast-driven write-offs, and Qualcomm highlights customer forecast unreliability and binding commitment gaps.",

      "question": "How do ADBE, AVGO, and QCOM differ in their disclosure of remaining performance obligations, particularly in terms of the magnitude, timing of revenue recognition, and contractual structure?",
      "answer": "ADBE reports $19.96 billion in remaining performance obligations as of November 29, 2024, reflecting a 16% increase from the prior year, indicating a growing backlog of committed revenue to be recognized in future periods. AVGO discloses $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations as of November 3, 2024, with approximately 43% expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, primarily from multi-year contracts in its semiconductor and infrastructure software segments. QCOM, while not providing a total figure, notes that its remaining performance obligations are primarily included in unearned revenues and highlights that it recognized $312 million in fiscal 2024 from prior period unearned revenues, with obligations largely tied to upfront fees and IP licensing with continuing performance obligations. These differences suggest ADBE has a strong and growing subscription-based backlog, AVGO has significant long-term contract commitments with partial near-term recognition, and QCOM\u2019s obligations are more tied to licensing and shorter-term revenue realization.",

We  have  made  significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments and our ex perienceled growth strategy.\n\nDigital Experience revenue was $5.37 billion in fiscal 2024, up from $4.89 billion in fiscal 2023, representing 10% year-over-year growth. Subscription revenue grew to $4.86 billion in fiscal 2024, up from $4.33 billion in fiscal 2023, representing 12% year-over-year growth.\n\n## Macroeconomic Conditions\n\nAs a corporation with an extensive global footprint, we are subject to risks and exposures from the evolving macroeconomic environment, including the effects of  increased  global  inflationary  pressures  and  interest  rates,  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  ex change  rates,  potential  economic  slowdowns  or  recessions  and geopolitical pressures, including the unknown impacts of current and future trade regulations. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results.\n\nWhile  our  revenue  and  earnings  are  relatively  predictable  as  a  result  of  our  subscription-based  business  model,  the  broader  implications  of  these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of these macroeconomic issues on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2024\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $17.33 billion as of November 29, 2024 increased by $2.00 billion, or 13%, from $15.33 billion as of December 1, 2023.\n- Creative revenue of $12.68 billion during fiscal 2024 increased by $1.17 billion, or 10%, from $11.52 billion in fiscal 2023.

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usage-based royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of November 3, 2024 were approximately $20.5 billion. We expect approximately 43% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. For contracts with termination for convenience rights, our customers generally do not exercise those rights. In addition, the majority of our revenue is from contracts with a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods.\n\n## 4. Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the VMware Merger. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger was indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash or 2.52 shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis). The stockholder election was prorated, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, in each case, was equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger. Based on the VMware stockholders' elections, the VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock with a fair value of $53,398 million.\n\nWe funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Term Loans, as defined and discussed in Note 10. 'Borrowings', as well as cash on hand. We assumed $8,250 million of VMware's outstanding senior unsecured notes.\n\n## Purchase Consideration\n\n",

      "answer": "Cisco reports $1.9 billion in state NOL carryforwards, many of which are acquisition-related and subject to annual recognition limits, with a valuation allowance of $10 million for state NOLs not expected to be realized, and these NOLs begin to expire in fiscal 2025. NVIDIA reports $342 million in state NOL carryforwards, which begin to expire in fiscal 2025, and maintains a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to certain state and other deferred tax assets. Oracle reports $2.1 billion in state NOL carryforwards, with approximately $2.0 billion subject to expiration between fiscal 2025 and 2044, and $49 million not subject to expiration. The differences in NOL amounts, expiration timelines, and valuation allowances suggest varying degrees of optimism about future profitability and differing tax planning strategies across the companies, with Oracle appearing to have the most long-term flexibility due to the larger portion of non-expiring NOLs.",

      "question": "How do Adobe, Salesforce, and NVIDIA each explain or quantify the impact of share dilution on diluted net income per share, and what does this reveal about their respective capital structures and equity compensation strategies?",
      "answer": "Adobe reports that the shares used to compute diluted net income per share increased from 459.1 million in 2023 to 449.7 million in 2024, with dilutive potential common shares rising from 2.0 million to 2.6 million, indicating a growing impact of stock-based compensation. Salesforce provides a qualitative explanation of its diluted net income per share calculation, emphasizing the dilutive effect of equity awards under the treasury stock method, though it does not disclose specific figures for dilutive shares. NVIDIA quantifies its dilutive impact, showing that the dilutive impact of outstanding equity awards remained relatively stable at 249 million in 2024 compared to 250 million in 2023, despite a significant increase in net income. This suggests that Adobe is experiencing increasing dilution pressure, Salesforce maintains a consistent but opaque approach, and NVIDIA is managing dilution effectively amid rapid earnings growth.",

For fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $1.7 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, if recognized, would have reduced income tax  ex pense and the Company's effective tax  rate.\n\nThe Company has recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision of $89 million, $29 million and $48 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, were $225 million, $136 million and $107 million, respectively.\n\nCertain prior year tax  returns are currently being ex amined by various tax ing authorities in major tax  jurisdictions including the United States, G ermany and Israel. The Company currently considers U.S. federal, Japan, Australia, G ermany, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, India and Israel to be major tax jurisdictions. The Company's U.S. federal tax returns since fiscal 2008 remain open to examination, and non-U.S. tax returns generally remain open to examination since fiscal 2019. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. As the outcome of the tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, if any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company could adjust its provision for income taxes in the future.\n\nThe Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that an insignificant decrease of its unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the next 12 months, as the applicable statutes of limitations lapse, ongoing examinations are completed, or tax positions meet the conditions of being effectively settled.\n\n## 13. Net Income Per Share\n\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted net income per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method.\n\nA reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How do AVGO, ORCL, and QCOM each approach the increase or disclosure of authorized shares in their equity incentive plans, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies for stock-based compensation and future issuance capacity?",
      "answer": "AVGO increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under its 2012 Plan by 250 million shares during fiscal year 2023, bringing the total available shares to 364 million as of November 3, 2024. ORCL increased its authorized shares under the 2020 Plan by 300 million in fiscal 2022 and an additional 350 million in fiscal 2024, leaving 457 million shares available as of May 31, 2024. QCOM, rather than an increase, disclosed that as of September 29, 2024, approximately 75 million shares remained available for future grant under its 2023 Plan, which had been amended and restated with a 15 million share increase approved by stockholders in March 2024. This reveals that AVGO and ORCL are aggressively expanding their equity compensation capacity, likely to support ongoing M&A integration and talent retention, while QCOM maintains a more conservative posture with a smaller increase and a clearly defined remaining issuance pool.",

      "question": "How do Adobe, Cisco, and Texas Instruments differ in the way they disclose and quantify deferred compensation liabilities, and what does this reveal about their employee retention strategies and financial commitments to long-term incentive programs?",
      "answer": "Adobe discloses $297 million in undistributed deferred compensation due to participants as of November 29, 2024, with a portion invested in mutual funds and recorded as other assets. Cisco includes deferred compensation within its 'Other Long-Term Liabilities' totaling $1.7 billion in noncurrent income tax payables and $76 million in deferred tax liabilities, indicating a broader but less specific treatment of deferred compensation obligations. Texas Instruments provides a more direct and quantified view, listing $443 million in deferred compensation liabilities as of December 31, 2024, with no corresponding asset investments disclosed. These differences suggest Adobe focuses on structured deferral and investment mechanisms tied to equity compensation, Cisco integrates deferred compensation within a larger tax and liability framework, and Texas Instruments maintains a simpler, more transparent deferred compensation liability structure without investment offsets.",

For equity award elections, distributions are made in stock in the form of a lump sum payment only.\n\nCertain deferred compensation is invested in money market and other mutual funds and subsequently recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, with corresponding unrealized holding gains and losses recorded as investment gains (losses) in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Undistributed deferred compensation is recorded as other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, the invested amounts under the plan totaled $283 million and $206 million, respectively. As of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, undistributed deferred compensation due to participants totaled $297 million and $222 million, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 12.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nOur stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock-based compensation plans and programs:\n\n## Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Programs\n\nWe grant restricted stock units and performance share awards to eligible employees under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan ('2019 Plan'). Restricted stock units generally vest over four years. Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the 'ECC').\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, we had reserved 69.0 million shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2019 Plan and had 34.3 million shares available for grant.\n\nOur  Performance  Share  Programs  aim  to  help  focus  key  employees  on  building  stockholder  value,  provide  significant  award  potential  for  achieving outstanding company performance and enhance our ability to attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. The ECC approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award calculation methodology. In January 2024, the ECC approved the 2024 Performance Share Program.\n\nShares outstanding under our 2024, 2023 and 2022 Performance Share Programs may be earned based on the achievement of (i) an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period, as well as (ii) revenue-based financial metrics measured over three one-year performance periods. Each type of performance goal is weighted 50% and achievement of each performance goal is determined independently of the other. Shares associated with each performance goal are not awarded until the corresponding performance targets are defined.\n\nPerformance share awards in each of our 2024, 2023 and 2022 Performance Share Programs will cliff-vest upon the later of (i) the three-year anniversary of the earliest vesting commencement date in the respective Performance Share Program, or (ii) the ECC's certification of the level of achievement of the final performance period in the respective Performance Share Program, contingent upon the participant's continued service. Participants can earn between 0% and 200% of the target number of performance shares.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, the shares awarded under our 2024, 2023 and 2022 Performance Share Programs remained outstanding and unvested.\n\n## Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nOur Employee Stock Purchase Plan ('ESPP') allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP consists of twenty-four-month offering periods with four six-month purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower. If the market value of our common stock at the end of a purchase period is lower than the market value at the beginning of the offering period, participants are rolled over into the subsequent offering, resulting in a reset of the offering price and the twenty-four month offering period.",

Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.\n\nLong-Term Debt The  amount  of  long-term  debt  in  the  preceding  table  represents  the  principal  amount  of  the  respective  debt  instruments.  See  Note  12  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTransition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act ('the Tax  Act').\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income tax es payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income tax es payable of approximately $1.7 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $76 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Commitments\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments. The funding commitments were $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 27, 2024 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.\n\nWe provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under 'Financing Receivables and Guarantees.'\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs (including inventory and other supply related payments), capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.",

      "answer": "AMD quantifies its exposure to the Indian Rupee through foreign currency forward contracts, with a notional amount of $700 million as of December 28, 2024, reflecting a fair value loss of $6 million, indicating active hedging against Rupee volatility. CRM highlights its exposure to the Indian Rupee as part of broader foreign exchange risk, noting that fluctuations can negatively impact financial results and cash flows, but its hedging activities are limited in scope and may not fully offset adverse movements. ORCL also identifies the Indian Rupee as a key currency in its foreign exchange exposure, acknowledging that changes in its value relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect reported revenues and profitability, and employs a program of foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate these risks. Collectively, these perspectives show that while all three companies recognize the Indian Rupee as a material currency risk, they differ in the extent and specificity of their hedging strategies and financial disclosures around this exposure.",

Furthermore, governments' responses to macroeconomic factors and tax revenue needs may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and financial results.\n\n## We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies.\n\nWe primarily conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including in emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency ex change rates, combined with the seasonality of our business, could affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.\n\nAdditionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including the war in Ukraine and regional conflict in the Middle East, fluctuating commodity prices, uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy and inflation, have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which has and could in the future amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Our debt service obligations, lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had a substantial level of outstanding debt, including our Senior Notes. We are also party to the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for our $5.0 billion Credit Facility. Although there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2025, we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.\n\nIn addition to the outstanding and potential debt obligations above, we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with noncancellable future payments on our long-term lease agreements. We also have significant other contractual commitments, including leases that have not yet commenced and commitments with infrastructure service providers, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could:\n\n- impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital ex penditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n- cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments; and\n- make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\n\nOur ability to meet our ex penses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business.\n\nIn addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit ratings may negatively impact our reputation, the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\n\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in",

If we lose one or more of our key customers for any reason, or we experience a delay in even a small number of these large transactions, our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability could fall significantly short of our predictions. In addition, sudden shifts in regional or global economic or political activity may cause our sales forecasts to be inaccurate.\n\nIn addition, we hold a portfolio of publicly traded equity investments and privately held debt and equity investments, including investments in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC (Ampere), a privately held related party entity in which we had an ownership interest of approximately 29% as of May 31, 2024. Any i mpairment charges and effect of changes in the fair values of certain of these investments are recorded as unrealized gains or losses as a component of consolidated net income in each period. The timing and amount of impairment charges or changes in fair value, if any, of these investments depends on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance of the companies or funds in which we invest, and are also subject to the general conditions of public and private equity markets, which are uncertain and have in the past varied, and may in the future vary, materially by period. Changes in the fair values of these investments, including Ampere, have contributed, and may in the future contribute, to volatility in our net income that is not reflective of our core businesses. The amount of our investments in Ampere could increase in future periods for a variety of reasons, including due to the potential exercise of put options by our co-investors or call options by us. If either of these options are exercised by us or our co-investors, we would acquire control of Ampere and its results would be consolidated with our results of operations. Ampere has generated net losses in the past and we currently expect such entity to generate net losses in future periods that we may need to consolidate into our results of operations in future periods.\n\nChanges in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability. We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign currencies, particularly the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and Saudi Riyal, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into U.S. Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. Generally, our reported revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies and reported in U.S. Dollars.\n\nIn addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged to earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to ti me. As part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at l east in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, including the cost to obtain such contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, i f our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and any related fees paid to purchase such contracts, and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.",

Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60  days.  In  instances  where  the  timing  of  revenue  recognition  differs  from  the  timing  of  invoicing,  we  have  determined  our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\n\nAs  of  December  3,  2021,  the  balance  of  deferred  revenue  was  $4.88  billion,  which  includes  $88  million  of  refundable customer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation right for  which  we  are  obligated  to  refund  amounts  paid  related  to  products  or  services  not  yet  delivered  or  provided  at  the  time  of cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products  or  services.  Non-cancellable  and  non-refundable  committed  funds  related  to  these  agreements  comprised approximately 5% of the total deferred revenue.\n\nAs of November 27, 2020, the balance of deferred revenue was $3.76 billion. Significant movements in the deferred revenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying performance obligations  to  the  customer  and  deferred  revenue  assumed  through  acquisition,  which  were  offset  by  decreases  due  to  revenue recognized in the period. During the year ended December 3, 2021, approximately $3.55 billion of revenue was recognized that was included in the balance of deferred revenue as of November 27, 2020.\n\nTransaction  price  allocated  to  remaining  performance  obligations  represents  contracted  revenue  that  has  not  yet  been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several factors, including the timing of renewals and average contract term. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that are billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based royalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint.\n\nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021. Non-cancellable and nonrefundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above comprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining performance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the next 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\n\n## Contract Acquisition Costs\n\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized.\n\nThe costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel. Capitalized costs may also include portions of fringe benefits and payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs to acquire customer contracts and incentive payments to partners.\n\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis,  to  be  5  years.  Amortization  of  capitalized  costs  are  included  in  sales  and  marketing  expense  in  our  Consolidated Statements  of  Income.  During  fiscal  2021  and  2020,  we  amortized  $212  million  and  $186  million  of  capitalized  contract acquisition costs into sales and marketing expense, respectively. We did not incur any impairment losses in fiscal 2021 and 2020.\n\nCapitalized contract acquisition costs were $611 million and $530 million as of December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020, of which $406 million and $352 million was long-term and included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,",

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. The majority of our customer software contracts include termination for convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are not considered committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usagebased royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions segment contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of October 30, 2022 were approximately $23.6 billion. We expect approximately 28% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Although the majority of our software contracts are not deemed to be committed, our customers generally do not exercise their termination for convenience rights. In addition, the majority of our contracts for products, subscriptions and services have a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods.\n\n## 4. Acquisitions\n\n## Pending Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 'VMware Merger Agreement') to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger') that values VMware at approximately $61 billion based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash.\n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger.\n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware RSU awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.\n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors.\n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion.\n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $1.5 billion.",

      "question": "How do Cisco (CSCO), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) compare in their total current liabilities for the most recent fiscal year, and what might this reveal about their respective liquidity pressures and short-term financial obligations?",
      "answer": "Cisco reported total current liabilities of $25,640 million, Intel reported $27,462 million, and Qualcomm reported $11,866 million. This indicates that Intel had the highest short-term obligations among the three, which could signal greater liquidity pressure. Qualcomm's significantly lower current liabilities relative to its peers suggest potentially stronger short-term financial flexibility, while Cisco, despite having a large liability base, maintains a strong asset position to offset these obligations.",

        "Hop 1: CSCO \u2192 Total Cur. Liab.: Cisco reports $25,640 million in total current liabilities, with major components including $12,784 million in deferred revenue and $5,199 million in other current liabilities.",

      "question": "How do ADBE, AVGO, and NVDA differ in their basic net income per share disclosures for fiscal years 2022-2024, and what do these differences reveal about their capital structure efficiency and profitability trends?",
      "answer": "ADBE reported basic net income per share of $12.43 in 2024, up from $11.87 in 2023 and $10.13 in 2022, indicating consistent profitability growth with a declining share count that improved per-share metrics. NVDA showed a much more dramatic increase, with basic net income per share rising from $0.18 in 2023 to $2.97 in 2024, reflecting its explosive growth in net income ($4,368 million to $72,880 million) despite relatively stable share counts. AVGO's filing explains its methodology for calculating basic net income per share but does not provide specific per-share figures in the excerpted text, suggesting a different disclosure approach compared to ADBE and NVDA. These differences highlight ADBE's steady performance, NVDA's rapid scaling, and AVGO's opaque reporting of this metric in the provided materials.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe estimate forfeitures expected to occur and recognize stock-based compensation expense for such awards expected to vest. We will recognize additional expense if actual forfeitures are lower than we estimated, and will recognize a benefit if actual forfeitures are higher than we estimated. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on stock-based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.\n\nShipping and handling costs. Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue and the associated expense is included in cost of revenue for all periods presented.\n\nLitigation and settlement costs. We are involved in legal actions and other matters arising in our recent business acquisitions and in the normal course of business. We recognize an estimated loss contingency when the outcome is probable prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss.\n\nIncome taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and l i a bi l i ti es  a re determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates i n effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in i ncome in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nWe recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. If we determine that we are able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net carrying values, we adjust the valuation allowance and reduce the provision for income taxes or increase the benefit from income taxes. Likewise, if we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, we increase the provision for income taxes or decrease the benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made.\n\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the '2017 Tax Act') introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ('GILTI') provisions of the 2017 Tax Act require Broadcom to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary's tangible assets. We have elected to record the impacts of GILTI during the period incurred.\n\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on income taxes. This guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.\n\nNet income per share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of unvested RSUs and ESPP rights (together referred to as 'equity awards'), as well as convertible preferred stock. Potentially dilutive shares whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share.\n\nThe dilutive effect of equity awards is calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for purchasing shares under the ESPP and the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. The dilutive effect of convertible preferred stock is calculated using the ifconverted method. The if-converted method assumes that these securities were converted at the beginning of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive.\n\n## 3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\n## Disaggregation\n\nWe have considered (1) information that is regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') as defined by the authoritative guidance on segment reporting, in evaluating financial performance and (2) disclosures presented outside of our financial statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and subscriptions and services, as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, revenues by reportable segment are presented in Note 13. 'Segment Information.'",
