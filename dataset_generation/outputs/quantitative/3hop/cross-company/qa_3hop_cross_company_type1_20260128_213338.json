      "question": "How has the increase in transitional and other employee-related costs at Oracle from 2022 to 2023 compared to the impact of employee costs on NVIDIA's financial results in fiscal year 2023, particularly in relation to warranty liabilities and supply chain disruptions?",
      "answer": "Oracle's transitional and other employee-related costs increased significantly from $10 million in 2022 to $77 million in 2023, representing a 670% increase. This increase suggests a strategic shift or restructuring activity affecting Oracle's cost structure. Meanwhile, NVIDIA reported in fiscal year 2023 that employee costs, among other factors, negatively impacted its financial results, particularly due to a defect in a third-party component embedded in Data Center products, which led to a significant warranty liability. While Oracle's rising employee-related costs reflect internal restructuring, NVIDIA's financial exposure from employee costs is more tied to operational risks like product defects and supply chain issues. Both companies show how employee-related financial metrics can influence business strategy and risk exposure differently.",

        "Hop 1: NVDA \u2192 Employee Costs: NVIDIA's employee costs negatively impacted financial results in FY2023, partly due to a defect in a third-party component in Data Center products that led to warranty liabilities.",

Microsoft\u2019s 7-year average masks a mix that includes shorter-lived assets like marketing-related (4 years), contrasting with Adobe\u2019s more differentiated approach.

      "question": "How does the inclusion of issuance costs in effective interest rates for Cisco's debt compare with Texas Instruments' trend in issuance costs as a percentage of total debt proceeds across their recent bond issuances?",
      "answer": "Cisco's effective interest rates explicitly include issuance costs as a component, indicating that these costs directly influence their overall borrowing expenses. Texas Instruments incurred $10 million in issuance costs on a $1.5 billion bond issuance in 2021, and $5 million on a $750 million issuance in 2020, suggesting issuance costs have remained proportionally consistent at approximately 0.67% of principal. This allows for a comparison of how both companies experience debt financing costs, with Cisco factoring these into effective rates while Texas Instruments reports them as upfront expenses.",

          "chunk_text": "## If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number  of  suppliers  and  our  operations  depend  upon  obtaining  deliveries  of  adequate  supplies  of  equipment  and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU  products.  Similarly,  certain  non-proprietary  materials  or  components  such  as  memory,  printed  circuit  boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If  the  delivery  of  such  supply  is  delayed  or  does  not  occur  for  any  reason,  it  could  materially  impact  our  ability  to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand  could  result  in  excess  inventory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs,  particularly  since  we  have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty  manufacturing  suppliers  purchase  are  complex,  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  substitute  one  supplier  for  another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.  Also,  some  of  these  materials  and  components  may  be  subject  to  rapid  changes  in  price  and  availability. Interruption  of  supply  or  increased  demand  in  the  industry  could  cause  shortages  and  price  increases  in  various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing  suppliers  are  unable  to  procure  materials  for  manufacturing  our  products,  our  business  would  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Failure  to  achieve  expected  manufacturing  yields  for  our  products  could  negatively  impact  our  financial results.\n\nSemiconductor  manufacturing  yields  are  a  result  of  both  product  design  and  process  technology,  which  is  typically proprietary  to  the  manufacturer,  and  low  yields  can  result  from  design  failures,  process  technology  failures  or  a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during  production,  we  may  fail  to  achieve  acceptable  yields  or  experience  product  delivery  delays.  We  cannot  be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies  needed  to  manufacture  future  generations  of  our  products  profitably  or  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are  implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay  in  the  technology  transitions  to  smaller  process  technologies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of supply chain challenges. More typically, however, to ensure the availability of our semiconductor products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.\n\nConversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. If we are unable to meet such increases in demand, this could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins'. These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. A delay or cancellation of a customer's plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins at the same time, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses. Further, often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing line for those products. The qualification process can take significant time and resources. Delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue. Finally, customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products, and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles.\n\n## Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.\n\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new delivery methods. We expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets.\n\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, a larger installed customer base, larger technical staffs, more established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and development, technical and marketing resources than us. We also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry, open source authors who provide software and IP for free, competitors who offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models, and customers who develop competing products.\n\nIn addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape. We expect this trend to continue, which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us. Some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better patent protection than us.\n\nThe actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us. Further, competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technical information, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's increase in research and development spending from $1,983 million to $2,225 million compare with Texas Instruments' allocation of R&D resources to its Analog segment, especially considering that Analog contributes significantly to Texas Instruments' operating profit and holds $4,158 million in goodwill?",
      "answer": "Oracle increased its research and development spending from $1,983 million in 2023 to $2,225 million in 2024, reflecting a growing investment in innovation. Meanwhile, Texas Instruments allocated $1,317 million of its $1,863 million total R&D spending specifically to its Analog segment in 2023, underscoring the strategic importance of Analog, which generated $5,821 million in operating profit. This segment also holds $4,158 million in goodwill, indicating its significant value to Texas Instruments. While Oracle shows a rising trend in R&D investment overall, Texas Instruments focuses a large portion of its R&D on Analog, aligning with its high profitability and asset value.",

      "answer": "Broadcom mitigated component cost pressures through long-term supplier relationships and proactive supply chain management, which helped protect margins indirectly by avoiding disruptions and enabling faster time-to-market. In contrast, Cisco explicitly implemented price increases during fiscal 2022 to offset rising component and logistics costs, which partially offset a 2.1 percentage point decrease in product gross margin caused by supply chain constraints. While Broadcom\u2019s internal sourcing for proprietary processes and supplier diversification efforts supported margin stability, Cisco\u2019s gross margin still declined due to the scale of external cost pressures, despite pricing adjustments.",

Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers, and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer's organization. Certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers' requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers. Many of our customers and their contract manufacturers often require time critical delivery of our products to multiple locations around the world. With sales offices located in various countries, our primary warehouse in Malaysia, and dedicated regional customer support call centers, where we address customer issues and handle logistics and other order fulfillment requirements, we believe we are well-positioned to support our customers throughout the design, technology transfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies.\n\nOur software customers are in most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies, other financial services providers, government agencies, global IT service providers, telecommunication providers, transportation companies, manufacturers, technology companies, retailers, educational organizations and health care institutions. Our customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe-centric, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Manufacturing Operations\n\nWe focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model. Accordingly, we outsource a majority of our manufacturing operations, utilizing third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities, as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions. The majority of our front-end wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited ('TSMC'). We use third-party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations, including Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Amkor Technology, Inc. and Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. We use our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes, such as our FBAR filters for wireless communications and our vertical-cavity surface emitting laser and side emitting lasers-based on GaAs and InP lasers for fiber optic communications, while outsourcing commodity processes such as standard CMOS. By doing so, we can protect our IP and accelerate time to market for our products. The majority of our internal III-V semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the U.S. and Singapore.\n\nWe also have a long history of operating in Asia where we manufacture and source the majority of our products and materials. We store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in Malaysia and our presence in Asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers' manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Manufacturing Materials and Suppliers\n\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials. We purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis. These purchases are generally on a purchase order basis and some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time and cost necessary for re-design or qualification. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we may use a number of techniques, including redesigning products for alternative components, making incremental or 'lifetime' purchases, or qualifying more than one source of supply. Our long-term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans, and to monitor our suppliers' financial health. Some suppliers may, nonetheless, extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique or highly specialized components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly, or at all.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. The competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many industries, as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, while others have begun collaborating with each other. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors, including: quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system",

We  believe  these actions are helping us to optimize our access to critical components and meet customer demand for our products. We continue to see solid demand across the majority of our portfolio. As a result, in order to secure supply to meet customer demand, we have increased our inventory balances, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments (see '-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Inventory Supply Chain'), which, in turn, has increased our supply chain exposure. Additionally, in certain situations, we have prepaid or made deposits with suppliers to secure future supply. These actions significantly increase the risk of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses if customer demand were to suddenly and significantly decrease in future  periods.

This profitability suggests Mobileye has a strong market foothold, which likely contributes to the competitive pressures Qualcomm acknowledges, as Mobileye is explicitly listed as a competitor in QCOM's 2023 10-K filing. Qualcomm highlights that Mobileye competes across key areas like automotive semiconductors, where margins and R&D investments are critical. Mobileye\u2019s profitability could enable it to invest more heavily in innovation or pricing strategies, directly challenging Qualcomm\u2019s position in this growing segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: INTC \u2192 Total Operating Income: Intel's 2023 financials show the Mobileye segment contributed $664 million in operating income, indicating a strong profitability signal for that business unit.",
        "Hop 2: Total Operating Income \u2192 Mobileye: The Mobileye segment's $664 million in operating income underscores its strategic value and financial health within Intel\u2019s broader portfolio.",
        "Hop 3: Mobileye \u2190 QCOM: Qualcomm explicitly names Mobileye as a competitor in its 2023 10-K, particularly in the automotive semiconductor space, noting that such competitors may have advantages like stronger financials or vertical integration."

      "question": "How does the operating income contribution from Mobileye in 2023 compare to its revenue contribution within Intel's business, and how might this position Mobileye competitively against QCOM in the automotive semiconductor market?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Mobileye contributed $2,079 million in revenue and $664 million in operating income to Intel. This indicates that Mobileye operated with a profit margin of approximately 32% ($664M / $2,079M), suggesting it was a relatively efficient contributor to Intel's bottom line. Mobileye's focus on automotive technologies positions it as a competitor to Qualcomm (QCOM), which explicitly lists Mobileye among its key automotive semiconductor rivals. Given Mobileye\u2019s profitability and dedicated focus on automotive solutions, it could be seen as a strong contender against QCOM in the automotive segment, especially considering QCOM's need to navigate long design cycles and high regulatory standards in that sector.",

      "answer": "Adobe's 2022 gross carrying amount of acquisition-related intangible assets is not directly disclosed, but its total intangibles (including customer contracts, purchased technology, trademarks, and other) totaled $2,702 million with accumulated amortization of $882 million, resulting in a net value of $1,820 million. In contrast, NVIDIA reported a gross carrying amount of $3,418 million for acquisition-related intangible assets in 2022, with accumulated amortization of $1,304 million, resulting in a net carrying value of $2,114 million. This indicates that NVIDIA maintains a higher gross value of such assets but applies a more aggressive amortization schedule, reducing its net carrying value more rapidly compared to Adobe.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of IPR&D assets by AVGO, which are not subject to amortization, contrast with ORCL's amortization practices for finite-lived intangible assets, and what implications does this have for their respective financial reporting?",
      "answer": "AVGO reports $2,340 million in IPR&D assets as of November 3, 2024, which are not amortized due to their indefinite useful life status, as noted in their 10-K filing. In contrast, ORCL amortizes its finite-lived intangible assets over periods generally ranging from one to ten years, as part of its financial reporting practices. This difference highlights that AVGO's IPR&D assets do not incur periodic amortization expenses, unlike ORCL's intangible assets, which are systematically expensed over time, impacting each company's income statement and asset valuation differently.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 IPR&D: AVGO discloses $2,340 million in IPR&D assets as of November 3, 2024, which are not amortized.",
        "Hop 2: IPR&D \u2192 Amortization Period: AVGO's IPR&D is explicitly stated to have no amortization period (N/A), distinguishing it from finite-lived intangible assets.",
        "Hop 3: Amortization Period \u2190 ORCL: ORCL reports that its finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from one to ten years, reflecting a systematic expensing approach."

      "answer": "AVGO reports $70 million in IPR&D assets that are classified as indefinite-lived, meaning they are not amortized but instead subject to annual impairment testing. This contrasts with ORCL's approach where finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from one to 10 years, reflecting a strategy of systematically recognizing value over time. The indefinite treatment of IPR&D at AVGO suggests a long-term strategic view on innovation and potential future revenue streams, while ORCL's defined amortization periods indicate a more conservative, time-bound recognition of asset utility and cash flow contribution.",

      "answer": "AVGO reports $70 million in IPR&D assets, which are classified as finite-lived intangible assets but have no defined amortization period (N/A), indicating that these assets are not yet ready for commercialization and therefore not subject to amortization. In contrast, ORCL applies amortization periods ranging from one to ten years for its finite-lived intangible assets, aligning with the expected duration of cash flow contributions from these assets. ORCL\u2019s approach includes periodic reassessment of these periods, potentially adjusting them based on changing circumstances, while AVGO\u2019s IPR&D remains outside of amortization until completion and deployment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 IPR&D: AVGO discloses $70 million in IPR&D assets, which are finite-lived but have no defined amortization period (N/A), indicating they are not yet commercialized.",
        "Hop 2: IPR&D \u2192 Amortization Period: IPR&D assets are a category of intangible assets that typically do not have an amortization period until they are completed and placed into service, at which point they may be reclassified and amortized over their expected economic benefit period.",
        "Hop 3: Amortization Period \u2190 ORCL: ORCL reports amortization periods for finite-lived intangible assets ranging from one to ten years, with annual reassessments to ensure alignment with expected cash flow contributions from these assets."

These pricing decisions could alter global demand patterns for Apple's products, indirectly impacting downstream demand for components or systems from companies like AMD. AMD, which faces inventory risks due to challenges in forecasting customer demand and potential overproduction, could experience increased volatility in order cancellations or deferrals if global demand shifts unexpectedly. This chain of effects could heighten AMD's risk of excess or obsolete inventory, particularly for products tied to Apple's ecosystem, leading to potential inventory write-downs and reduced gross margins for AMD.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n## Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis  and  in  conjunction  with  its  underlying  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  exposures.  Given  the  effective  horizons  of  the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company's exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in  U.S.  interest  rates  affect  the  interest  earned  on  the  Company's  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  and  the  fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company's debt.\n\nThe Company's investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company's liquidity requirements.  The  Company  uses  a  combination  of  internal  and  external  management  to  execute  its  investment  strategy  and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company's investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs  of  September  24,  2022,  the  Company  had  outstanding  fixed-rate  notes  and  as  of  September  25,  2021,  the  Company  had outstanding  floating-  and  fixed-rate  notes  with  varying  maturities  for  an  aggregate  carrying  amount  of  $110.1  billion  and  $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its  outstanding  term  debt.  Interest  rate  swaps  allow  the  Company  to  effectively  convert  fixed-rate  payments  into  floating-rate payments  or  floating-rate  payments  into  fixed-rate  payments.  Gains  and  losses  on  term  debt  are  generally  offset  by  the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company's debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe  Company  may  enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  with  financial  institutions  to  protect  against  foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency  contracts  to  partially  offset  the  foreign  currency  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  its  foreign  currency-denominated  debt issuances.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its  forecasted  foreign  currency  exposure  associated  with  revenue  and inventory  purchases,  typically  for  up  to  12  months.  However,  the  Company  may  choose  not  to  hedge  certain  foreign  exchange exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number  of  suppliers  and  our  operations  depend  upon  obtaining  deliveries  of  adequate  supplies  of  equipment  and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU  products.  Similarly,  certain  non-proprietary  materials  or  components  such  as  memory,  printed  circuit  boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If  the  delivery  of  such  supply  is  delayed  or  does  not  occur  for  any  reason,  it  could  materially  impact  our  ability  to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand  could  result  in  excess  inventory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs,  particularly  since  we  have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty  manufacturing  suppliers  purchase  are  complex,  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  substitute  one  supplier  for  another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.  Also,  some  of  these  materials  and  components  may  be  subject  to  rapid  changes  in  price  and  availability. Interruption  of  supply  or  increased  demand  in  the  industry  could  cause  shortages  and  price  increases  in  various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing  suppliers  are  unable  to  procure  materials  for  manufacturing  our  products,  our  business  would  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Failure  to  achieve  expected  manufacturing  yields  for  our  products  could  negatively  impact  our  financial results.\n\nSemiconductor  manufacturing  yields  are  a  result  of  both  product  design  and  process  technology,  which  is  typically proprietary  to  the  manufacturer,  and  low  yields  can  result  from  design  failures,  process  technology  failures  or  a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during  production,  we  may  fail  to  achieve  acceptable  yields  or  experience  product  delivery  delays.  We  cannot  be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies  needed  to  manufacture  future  generations  of  our  products  profitably  or  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are  implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay  in  the  technology  transitions  to  smaller  process  technologies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",

      "question": "How might the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility on Apple's gross margins compare to AMD's exposure through excess inventory risks, given the connection between gross margins and inventory write-downs?",
      "answer": "Apple's gross margins are negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, particularly when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, increasing the cost of foreign-denominated components and reducing gross margins. AMD, on the other hand, faces gross margin pressure from excess inventory risks due to demand volatility and supply chain mismatches, which can lead to inventory write-downs. Since gross margins are directly affected by both FX-driven component costs (Apple) and inventory write-downs (AMD), the financial performance of both companies is vulnerable to margin compression through different but interconnected mechanisms. Specifically, Apple notes that strengthening foreign currencies can increase component costs, while AMD highlights that excess inventory from demand forecasting errors can lead to write-downs, both of which reduce gross margins.",

          "chunk_text": "## The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated  sales  and  earnings,  and  generally  leads  the  Company  to  raise  international  pricing,  potentially  reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.\n\nConversely,  a  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  while  generally  beneficial  to  the  Company's  foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  the  benefit.  Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  increase  the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and  resellers.  The  Company  also  sells  its  products  and  services  directly  to  small  and  mid-sized  businesses  and  education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade receivables  can  be  concentrated  within  cellular  network  carriers  or  other  resellers.  The  Company's  exposure  to  credit  and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Company's vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade  and  vendor  non-trade  receivables,  as  well  as  long-term  prepayments,  there  can  be  no  assurance  such  procedures  will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\n## The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix  of  earnings  in  countries  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16",

          "chunk_text": "## If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number  of  suppliers  and  our  operations  depend  upon  obtaining  deliveries  of  adequate  supplies  of  equipment  and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU  products.  Similarly,  certain  non-proprietary  materials  or  components  such  as  memory,  printed  circuit  boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If  the  delivery  of  such  supply  is  delayed  or  does  not  occur  for  any  reason,  it  could  materially  impact  our  ability  to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand  could  result  in  excess  inventory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs,  particularly  since  we  have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty  manufacturing  suppliers  purchase  are  complex,  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  substitute  one  supplier  for  another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.  Also,  some  of  these  materials  and  components  may  be  subject  to  rapid  changes  in  price  and  availability. Interruption  of  supply  or  increased  demand  in  the  industry  could  cause  shortages  and  price  increases  in  various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing  suppliers  are  unable  to  procure  materials  for  manufacturing  our  products,  our  business  would  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Failure  to  achieve  expected  manufacturing  yields  for  our  products  could  negatively  impact  our  financial results.\n\nSemiconductor  manufacturing  yields  are  a  result  of  both  product  design  and  process  technology,  which  is  typically proprietary  to  the  manufacturer,  and  low  yields  can  result  from  design  failures,  process  technology  failures  or  a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during  production,  we  may  fail  to  achieve  acceptable  yields  or  experience  product  delivery  delays.  We  cannot  be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies  needed  to  manufacture  future  generations  of  our  products  profitably  or  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are  implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay  in  the  technology  transitions  to  smaller  process  technologies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",

      "question": "How does the impact of lower contract profitability on ACN's European operations compare to the risks Apple faces in its Europe segment, particularly in terms of geographic concentration and cost management?",
      "answer": "Apple's Europe segment, which includes countries in Europe, India, the Middle East, and Africa, faces risks related to geographic concentration in manufacturing (with outsourcing partners primarily located in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam), supply chain constraints, and custom component availability. These factors could affect the segment\u2019s operating income and product availability. Meanwhile, ACN's European operations experienced a decline in operating income due to lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs, as noted in fiscal 2022. ACN also highlights in its 2024 filing that contract profitability is highly sensitive to forecasting accuracy, third-party performance, and execution risks in large-scale engagements, which could lead to unanticipated cost increases or reduced margins. Therefore, while Apple\u2019s Europe segment is exposed to supply chain and geographic concentration risks, ACN\u2019s Europe performance is more directly tied to internal cost management and contract execution challenges.",

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\n## Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company's hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\n## Note 13 - Segment Information and G eographic Data\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the A mericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of A sia Pacific. A mericas includes both North and South A merica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the M iddle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and T aiwan. Rest of A sia Pacific includes A ustralia and those A sian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. A lthough the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company's customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists  of  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales,  and  operating  ex penses  directly   attributable  to  the  segment.  The  information  prov ided  to  the Company's chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.",

The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021:\n\n- North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.\n- Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs.\n- Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During fiscal 2022, Other income (expense) decreased $238 million from fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments. For additional information on investments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Loss on Disposition of Russia Business\n\nWe recorded a loss from the disposal of our business in Russia of $96 million during fiscal 2022.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 24.0%, compared with 22.8% for fiscal 2021. Absent the $271 million investment gains and related $41 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 would have been 23.1%. The higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes. For",

          "chunk_text": "Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability. Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including taking actions to reduce certain costs and optimize our business. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to cost-effectively hire and retain people with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions, particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations, we may incur increased costs, which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability.\n\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable. Our contract profitability  is highly  dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client's satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nMoreover, many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy  these measures, it could significantly  reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms, any of which could significantly affect our profitability. We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients' actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved. Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nWe are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients' businesses. These deals may involve transforming a client's business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business. The scale and complexity of these projects present risks in execution and profitability challenges as a result of the costs we incur and investments we make at the beginning of these transactions. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the anticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or provide anticipated productivity gains, or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. A ny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\n\n## Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\n\nIn addition, our effectiv e tax  rate in the future could be adv ersely  affected by  challenges to our intercompany  transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

      "answer": "AMD reported a licensing gain of $48 million in 2024, which is significantly lower in magnitude compared to the $266 million increase in licensing revenue reported by QCOM's QTL segment during the same period. This suggests that licensing plays a much more substantial and growing role in QCOM's revenue strategy, particularly through its QTL segment, whereas for AMD, licensing gains appear to be a minor and possibly incidental component of overall financial performance.",

QCT also competes in both single-mode and multimode environments against alternative communications technologies. Additional competitive factors exist for QCT product offerings that have expanded into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and IoT. The automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in a significant barrier to entry and may result in increased costs.\n\nQCT's current competitors include, but are not limited to, companies such as Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Mobileye, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC. QCT also faces competition, which may intensify in the future, from products internally developed by our customers, including some of our largest customers, such as Apple and Samsung, to early-stage companies. Our competitors devote significant amounts of their financial, technical and other resources to develop and market competitive products and, in some cases, to develop and adopt competitive digital communication or signal processing technologies, and those efforts may materially and adversely affect us. Although we have attained a significant position in the semiconductor industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us. These and other risks related to competition are more fully described in the Risk Factors entitled ' Our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees' and 'Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).'\n\nQTL Segment . QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale and/or use of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing WCDMA (Wideband CDMA), LTE and/or OFDMA-based 5G standards and their derivatives. We grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use our cellular standardessential patents (including 3G, 4G and 5G) for both single-mode and multimode devices on a worldwide basis. We also offer licenses to our cellular standard-essential patents together with other Qualcomm patents that may be useful to such licensed products for licensees that desire to obtain the commercial benefits of receiving such broad patent rights from us. While we offer license rights to patents that we do not have a duty or obligation to grant, those rights may be negotiated at our discretion. A significant portion of QTL's licensing revenues is derived from licensees that have entered into license agreements that grant licenses under Qualcomm's cellular standard-essential patents. Our licensees manufacture wireless cellular products such as mobile devices (including handsets), other consumer devices (e.g., tablets and PCs), plug-in end user data modem cards and embedded modules for incorporation into machine-to-machine devices and certain other devices, connected vehicle units and connected vehicle modules used in automobiles, wireless access points and small cell wireless products.\n\nSince our founding in 1985, we have focused heavily on technology development and innovation. These efforts have resulted in a leading intellectual property portfolio related to foundational, system level technologies for the wireless industry. We have an extensive portfolio of United States and foreign patents, and we continue to pursue patent applications around the world. Our patents have broad coverage in many countries, including Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States and countries in Europe (including European patents with unitary effect). A substantial portion of our patents and patent applications relate to digital wireless communications technologies, including patents that are essential or may be important to the commercial implementation of CDMA2000, WCDMA (UMTS), LTE and/or OFDMA-based 5G products. Our patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed in the industry, including more than 200 5G license agreements to date. Additionally, we have a substantial patent portfolio related to key technologies used in communications and other devices and/or related services, some of which are covered by industry standards. These include certain video codecs, audio codecs, Wi-Fi, memory interfaces, wireline interfaces, wireless power, position location, broadcast and streaming protocols, and short-range communication functionalities, including Bluetooth. Our patents cover a wide range of technologies across connectivity (including wireless devices and network infrastructure equipment), computing and AI applications in diverse end-markets, not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets. Over the years, a number of companies have challenged our patent position, but the mobile communications industry generally recognizes that any company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell certain wireless products that use 3G, 4G and/or 5G technologies requires a license or other rights to use our patents.\n\nWe have licensed or otherwise provided rights to use our patents to hundreds of companies on industry-accepted terms. Our strategy to make our patented technologies broadly available has been a catalyst for industry growth, helping to enable a wide range of companies offering a broad array of wireless products and features while increasing the capabilities of and/or driving down average and low-end selling prices for handsets and other wireless devices. By licensing or otherwise providing rights to use our patents to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, encouraging innovative applications, supporting equipment manufacturers with integrated chipset and software products and focusing on improving the efficiency of the airlink for wireless operators, we have helped multimode device capabilities evolve, grow demand and reduce device pricing. 5G network deployments and commercial 3G/4G/5G multimode device sales began in 2019 and have continued. By licensing or otherwise providing rights to use our patents to a wide range of equipment manufacturers, we are supporting the global rollout and availability of 5G technology. We believe that 5G will continue to encourage innovative applications through",

      "question": "How might a continued decline in AMD's gross margin percentage, driven by inventory write-downs, indirectly affect Qualcomm's QTL licensing revenues, given Qualcomm's historical relationship between gross margin and QTL revenue proportionality?",
      "answer": "A continued decline in AMD's gross margin percentage, caused by inventory write-downs from excess or obsolete inventory, could signal broader market challenges in semiconductor demand. If this leads to industry-wide pricing pressures or reduced R&D investments, it may indirectly impact Qualcomm's QTL licensing revenues. Historically, Qualcomm's gross margin remained flat in 2022 due to a decrease in the proportion of higher-margin QTL licensing revenues relative to QCT revenues. If semiconductor market conditions deteriorate further, Qualcomm may see a reduction in per-unit royalties from licensees, particularly if device manufacturers reduce production volumes or delay 5G technology rollouts, which are key drivers of QTL revenues.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Gross Margin Percentage: AMD's gross margin is negatively impacted by inventory write-downs due to excess or obsolete inventory, which may reflect broader market demand volatility.",
        "Hop 2: Gross Margin Percentage \u2192 QTL Licensing Revenues: Qualcomm's 2022 results showed that a drop in the proportion of QTL licensing revenues relative to QCT revenues can negatively affect overall gross margin performance.",

The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Such governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings could require us to change our patent licensing practices, as described herein in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.

QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including but not limited to 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses.

      "answer": "AMD's inventory write-down risks have already contributed to a negative impact on its gross margin percentage, as noted in AMD's 2024 10-K filing. A lower gross margin at AMD could signal a broader industry trend of margin pressure due to supply-demand mismatches or pricing competition. This trend could indirectly affect Qualcomm\u2019s business dynamics, particularly the proportion of QTL licensing revenues relative to QCT revenues. According to Qualcomm\u2019s 2022 10-K, a decrease in the proportion of QTL licensing revenues negatively impacted the overall gross margin percentage. However, in 2024, QTL licensing revenues increased by $402 million due to higher estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G multimode products.

      "answer": "Broadcom reports $70 million in IPR&D assets that are classified as indefinite-lived intangibles with no defined amortization period, contrasting with Salesforce's explicit four-year amortization of capitalized customer contract costs tied to Cloud Services subscriptions. While Broadcom's IPR&D valuation relies on forecasted revenue from future product development, Salesforce amortizes sales commissions and related costs over four years based on expected customer retention and renewal cycles, highlighting divergent strategies in recognizing value from intangible customer and innovation assets.",

          "chunk_text": "\nCustomer contracts and related relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from sales of SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications. Customer contracts and related relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the customer contracts and related relationships less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The economic useful life was determined based on the useful lives of other intangible assets and the length of time remaining on the acquired contracts.\n\nDeveloped technology relates to SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications. We valued the developed technology using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the developed technology. The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash flows over the forecast period.\n\nThe fair value of IPR&amp;D was determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue from the IPR&amp;D.\n\n## 5. Supplemental Financial Information\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents included $1,716 million and $1,470 million of time deposits and $1,171 million and $1,650 million of money-market funds as of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. For time deposits, carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of money-market funds, which was consistent with their carrying value, was determined using unadjusted prices in active, accessible markets for i dentical assets, and as such, they were classified as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Accounts Receivable Factoring\n\nWe sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring arrangements. We account for these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring arrangements were $5,900 million, $3,975 million and $3,700 million during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in other income (expense), net and were not material for any of the periods presented.\n\n## Inventory\n\n",

In contrast, Salesforce capitalizes costs related to new revenue contracts and amortizes them over four years, which is longer than the typical initial contract period but reflects the estimated average period of benefit, including expected renewals. Therefore, while Salesforce applies a consistent four-year amortization period to its capitalized contract acquisition costs, Broadcom does not amortize its IPR&D assets until they are completed and integrated into products, creating a distinct financial treatment influenced by the stage and nature of the development projects.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nat the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from software support and updates is recognized as the support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term.\n\nThe Company typically invoices its customers annually and its payment terms provide that customers pay within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.\n\n## Professional Services and Other Revenues\n\nThe Company's professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed price or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fix ed price contracts or ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services contracts. Other revenues consist primarily of training revenues recognized as such services are performed.\n\nSignificant Judgments - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nThe Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer multiple performance obligations such as Cloud Services, software licenses, support and updates and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are concluded to be distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.\n\nCloud Services, software licenses and support and updates services are generally concluded to be distinct because such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.\n\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation.\n\nThe Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company's discounting practices, the size and volume of the Company's transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, the Company's go-to-market strategy, historical and current sales and contract prices. In instances where the Company does not sell or price a product or service separately, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs by using information that may include market conditions. As the Company's go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.\n\nIn certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold or priced separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when indicated by the distribution of its observable prices.\n\nAlternatively, the Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP when the pricing practices or distribution of the observable prices are highly variable. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.\n\n## Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts\n\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining revenue contracts related to noncancellable Cloud Services subscription, ongoing Cloud Services support and license support and updates. For contracts with term software licenses where revenue is recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer, costs allocable to those licenses are expensed as they are incurred. Capitalized amounts consist primarily of sales commissions paid to the Company's direct sales force. Capitalized amounts also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired, (2) commissions paid to employees upon renewals of subscription and support contracts, (3) the associated payroll tax es and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to the Company's employees and (4) to a lesser extent, success fees paid to partners in emerging markets where the Company has a limited presence.\n\nCosts capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which is longer than the typical initial contract period, but reflects the estimated average period of benefit, including ex pected contract renewals. In arriving at this average period of benefit, the Company evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors which included the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition. Additionally, the Company amortizes capitalized costs for renewals and success fees paid to partners over two years.",

      "answer": "Broadcom (AVGO) reports $2,340 million in IPR&D assets as of 2024 with no amortization, indicating indefinite-lived intangible treatment. In contrast, Salesforce (CRM) capitalizes and amortizes costs related to revenue contracts over four years for new contracts and two years for renewals, showing a fundamentally different approach to asset recognition and amortization. This comparison is further contextualized by peer-level data showing that IPR&D assets, like those Broadcom holds, are typically not assigned a weighted-average amortization period, as seen in prior disclosures where IPR&D had an 'N/A' designation for amortization timelines.",

Revenue from software support and updates is recognized as the support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term.\n\nThe Company typically invoices its customers annually and its payment terms provide that customers pay within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.\n\n## Professional Services and Other Revenues\n\nThe Company's professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed price or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fix ed price contracts or ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services contracts. Other revenues consist primarily of training revenues recognized as such services are performed.\n\nSignificant Judgments - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nThe Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer multiple performance obligations such as Cloud Services, software licenses, support and updates and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are concluded to be distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.\n\nCloud Services, software licenses and support and updates services are generally concluded to be distinct because such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.\n\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation.\n\nThe Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company's discounting practices, the size and volume of the Company's transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, the Company's go-to-market strategy, historical and current sales and contract prices. In instances where the Company does not sell or price a product or service separately, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs by using information that may include market conditions. As the Company's go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.\n\nIn certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold or priced separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when indicated by the distribution of its observable prices.\n\nAlternatively, the Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP when the pricing practices or distribution of the observable prices are highly variable. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.\n\n## Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts\n\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining revenue contracts related to noncancellable Cloud Services subscription, ongoing Cloud Services support and license support and updates. For contracts with term software licenses where revenue is recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer, costs allocable to those licenses are expensed as they are incurred. Capitalized amounts consist primarily of sales commissions paid to the Company's direct sales force. Capitalized amounts also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired, (2) commissions paid to employees upon renewals of subscription and support contracts, (3) the associated payroll tax es and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to the Company's employees and (4) to a lesser extent, success fees paid to partners in emerging markets where the Company has a limited presence.\n\nCosts capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which is longer than the typical initial contract period, but reflects the estimated average period of benefit, including ex pected contract renewals. In arriving at this average period of benefit, the Company evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors which included the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition. Additionally, the Company amortizes capitalized costs for renewals and success fees paid to partners over two years.",

      "answer": "AVGO discloses the fair value of its IPR&D at $70 million but does not assign a defined amortization period to it, as seen in its 2024 10-K filing. This contrasts with CRM's approach, where the company actively evaluates and adjusts amortization periods based on changes in business conditions, market dynamics, or other events that may affect the recoverability of capitalized costs tied to customer contracts. AVGO's IPR&D valuation relies on the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach, which is based on forecasted revenue, while CRM emphasizes periodic reassessment of amortization periods to align with evolving revenue streams and potential impairment indicators.",

This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the customer contracts and related relationships less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The economic useful life was determined based on the useful lives of other intangible assets and the length of time remaining on the acquired contracts.\n\nDeveloped technology relates to SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications. We valued the developed technology using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the developed technology.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all noncancellable customer contracts. The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value.\n\n## Marketable Securities\n\nThe Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax , reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in ex cess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specificidentification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other income on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Strategic Investments\n\nThe Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest.\n\nPrivately held equity securities where the Company lacks a controlling financial interest but does exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted only for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Other privately held investments not classified as debt or equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairment events, with any associated gains and losses recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held strategic investments quarterly for impairment. The Company's impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment and recognizes any resulting impairment through the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nPublicly held equity securities are measured at fair value with changes recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement\n\nThe Company measures its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, publicly held equity securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. In addition, the Company measures certain of its strategic investments, including its privately held debt and equity securities, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there has been an observable price change in a same or similar security or an impairment event. The additional disclosures regarding the Company's fair value measurements are included in Note 4 'Fair Value Measurement.'",

      "question": "How has the increase in Oracle's research and development spending from 2023 to 2024 compared to the corresponding R&D investment in the Analog segment at Texas Instruments, and what might this imply about their respective innovation strategies in semiconductor technologies?",
      "answer": "Oracle's research and development spending increased from $1,983 million in 2023 to $2,225 million in 2024, reflecting a $242 million rise. Concurrently, Texas Instruments' Analog segment saw R&D investment grow from $1,178 million in 2022 to $1,317 million in 2023, a $139 million increase. This suggests Oracle is significantly ramping up its innovation investments, particularly in cloud and enterprise software domains, while Texas Instruments is also prioritizing R&D in its core Analog segment, albeit at a smaller incremental scale. The disparity in investment growth could signal differing strategic emphases, with Oracle focusing on expanding its cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities, while TI continues to refine and enhance its analog semiconductor offerings.",

      "answer": "Accenture reduced its Sales and Marketing costs by 60 basis points as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower selling and advertising expenses, contributing to a slight improvement in operating margin to 15.2%. In contrast, Oracle faced rising compensation costs that were not offset by productivity gains or sales improvements, with the company noting that increased labor costs\u2014including compensation and subcontractor expenses\u2014posed a significant challenge to maintaining profitability.

We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 721,000 as of August 31, 2022, compared to approximately 624,000 as of August 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we experienced a competitive labor market with high demand for the skills our people have, which contributed to elevated levels of voluntary attrition. For fiscal 2022, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 19%, up from 14% in fiscal 2021. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 20%, flat with 20% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.\n\nIn addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our people, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation has been and continues to increase faster than in prior years. In fiscal 2022, we have improved pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, across our business. While we are increasing pricing, as well as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology to reduce the impact of these compensation increases on our margin, the impact of these actions did not in fiscal 2022, and may not in the future, fully offset the impact of the compensation increases, resulting in lower contract profitability.\n\nOur ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisitionrelated costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisitionrelated costs.\n\nGross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2022 was 32.0%, compared with 32.4% for fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2022 was due to higher labor costs, including increased compensation and subcontractor costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs.\n\nSales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% for fiscal 2022, compared with 17.3% for fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, Sales and marketing costs decreased 60 basis points primarily due to lower selling and advertising costs as a percentage of revenues. General and administrative costs increased 10 basis points as a percentage of revenues.\n\nOperating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2022 was 15.2%, compared with 15.1% for fiscal 2021.",

These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings, and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees. We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder; our Chief Executive Officer; other members of our executive team; and other key employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. We recently reopened certain of our offices around the globe and we intend to reopen other offices when it is safe to do so and local requirements allow. Our employees continue to have flexibility to choose where and how to work. Depending on their role, this means that many employees can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home some or all of the time. While we believe this may help us engage with a wider pool of talent and may help to retain employees who want or need more flexibility, it  may  fail  to  yield  these  desired  benefits  and  could  also  lead  to  increased  employee  burnout  or  negatively  impact  employee productivity, and it may present cybersecurity risks and additional risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy. Despite our efforts to reopen our offices in a safe manner, our employees who have opted to return to the office may nevertheless be exposed to health risks, which may expose us to potential liability.\n\nWe may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.\n\nWe continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise  are  available  at  lower  costs.  When  we  make  adjustments  to  our  workforce,  we  may  incur  expenses  associated  with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We are experiencing increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which has affected our employee retention efforts and increased our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In addition, changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.\n\nOur  general  compensation  program  includes  restricted  stock  units  and  performance-based  equity,  which  are  important  tools  in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.\n\nOur cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channels could affect our future operating results. Our cloud and license, and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if:\n\n- our contracts with channel participants were terminated or our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate;\n- any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant;\n- the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken; or",

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft highlighted that its license-based proprietary software model continued to generate a substantial portion of its software revenue, despite increasing strategic focus on cloud-based services. This licensing revenue was critical to offsetting R&D investments. In contrast, Qualcomm's QTL segment saw a $266 million increase in licensing revenue in fiscal 2024, which was a key contributor to the overall revenue growth that year. Qualcomm's QTL segment, which primarily generates revenue through royalties from mobile handset sales, is described as recognizing licensing revenue over time, underscoring a more sustained and contractually embedded revenue model compared to Microsoft\u2019s traditional perpetual licensing approach.",

We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n- Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling thirdparty advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n- Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of  research  and  development  for  the  open  source  software.  Some  open  source  software  mimics  the  features  and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.\n\nOur increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building  best-in-class  platforms  and  productivity  services  for  an  intelligent  cloud  and  an  intelligent  edge  infused  with  artificial intelligence ('AI'). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in  the  cloud  and  sometimes  the  user's  choice  of  which  cloud-based  services  to  use.  We  are  devoting  significant  resources  to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment.

      "answer": "Microsoft's licensing revenue is a core component of its historical software revenue model, where it bears the full R&D costs and monetizes through direct licensing. In contrast, Qualcomm's QTL segment generates licensing revenue by offering rights to its extensive patent portfolio covering foundational wireless technologies, including 3G, 4G, and 5G standards. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm reported a $266 million increase in licensing revenues from the QTL segment, indicating its ongoing strategic importance. However, both companies face competitive risks: Microsoft competes with open-source and advertising-funded models, while Qualcomm faces challenges from industry vertical integration and alternative communication technologies. These risks are compounded for Qualcomm due to the competitive landscape in which QTL operates, including the need to maintain broad patent licensing adoption and navigate global regulatory scrutiny.",

We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n- Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling thirdparty advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n- Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of  research  and  development  for  the  open  source  software.  Some  open  source  software  mimics  the  features  and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.\n\nOur increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building  best-in-class  platforms  and  productivity  services  for  an  intelligent  cloud  and  an  intelligent  edge  infused  with  artificial intelligence ('AI'). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in  the  cloud  and  sometimes  the  user's  choice  of  which  cloud-based  services  to  use.  We  are  devoting  significant  resources  to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things ('IoT'). Our success in the IoT will depend on the  level  of  adoption  of  our  offerings  such  as Azure, Azure  Stack, Azure  IoT  Edge,  and Azure  Sphere.

The front-end processes primarily take place at manufacturing facilities located in Germany and Singapore and involve the imprinting of substrate wafers with the structure and circuitry required for the products to function (also known as wafer fabrication). The back-end processes include the assembly, packaging and test of RFFE modules and RF filter products and their preparation for distribution. Our back-end manufacturing facilities are located in China and Singapore.\n\nQCT's sales are primarily made through supply terms which implement a purchase order and order confirmation process for delivery of products. QCT generally allows customers to reschedule delivery dates within a defined time frame and to cancel orders prior to shipment with or without payment of a cancellation fee, depending on when the order is canceled. The industry in which QCT operates is intensely competitive. QCT competes worldwide with a number of U.S. and international designers and manufacturers of semiconductors. As a result of global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological changes, device manufacturer concentrations, limited global supply capacity, vertical integration and the potential for further industry consolidation, we anticipate the industry to remain very competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors for our products include performance, level of integration, quality, compliance with industry standards, price, time-to-market, system cost, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, growth and scaling of distribution channels, desire by certain customers to use multiple suppliers and customer support. QCT also competes in both single-mode and multimode environments against alternative communications technologies. Additional competitive factors exist for QCT product offerings that have expanded into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and IoT. The automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in a significant barrier to entry and may result in increased costs.\n\nQCT's current competitors include, but are not limited to, companies such as Apple, Broadcom, MediaTek, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC. QCT currently faces competition, which may intensify in the future, from products internally developed by our customers, including some of our largest customers, to early-stage companies. Our competitors devote significant amounts of their financial, technical and other resources to develop and market competitive products and, in some cases, to develop and adopt competitive digital communication or signal processing technologies, and those efforts may materially and adversely affect us. Although we have attained a significant position in the wireless industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us. These and other risks related to competition are more fully described in the Risk Factors entitled ' Our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees' and 'Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).'\n\nQTL Segment . QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale and/or use of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing CDMA2000, WCDMA (Wideband CDMA), LTE and/or OFDMAbased 5G standards and their derivatives. We grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use our cellular standard-essential patents (including 3G, 4G and 5G) for both single-mode and multimode devices on a worldwide basis. We also offer licenses to our cellular standard-essential patents together with other Qualcomm patents that may be useful to such licensed products for licensees that desire to obtain the commercial benefits of receiving such broad patent rights from us. While we offer license rights to patents that we do not have a duty or obligation to grant, those rights may be negotiated at our discretion. A significant portion of QTL's licensing revenues is derived from licensees that have entered into license agreements that grant licenses under Qualcomm's cellular standard-essential patents. Our licensees manufacture wireless cellular products such as mobile devices (including handsets), other consumer devices (e.g., tablets and laptops), plug-in end user data modem cards and embedded modules for incorporation into machine-to-machine devices and certain other devices, connected vehicle units and connected vehicle modules used in automobiles, wireless access points, small cell wireless products, infrastructure equipment required to establish and operate a cellular network and equipment to test wireless networks and cellular devices.\n\nSince our founding in 1985, we have focused heavily on technology development and innovation. These efforts have resulted in a leading intellectual property portfolio related to foundational, system level technologies for the wireless industry. We have an extensive portfolio of United States and foreign patents, and we continue to pursue patent applications around the world. Our patents have broad coverage in many countries, including Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States and countries in Europe. A substantial portion of our patents and patent applications relate to digital wireless communications technologies, including patents that are essential or may be important to the commercial implementation of CDMA2000, WCDMA (UMTS), LTE and/or OFDMA-based 5G products. Our patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed in the industry, including more than 190 5G license agreements to date. Additionally, we have a substantial patent portfolio related to key technologies used in communications and other devices and/or related services, some of which were developed in industry standards development organizations. These include certain video codecs, audio codecs, Wi-Fi, memory interfaces, wireless power, GPS and positioning, broadcast and streaming protocols, and short-range communication functionalities, including NFC and Bluetooth.

      "answer": "Microsoft's gross margin percentage decreased slightly in fiscal 2022 despite a $19.8 billion increase in gross margin driven by segment growth. In contrast, Qualcomm\u2019s gross margin percentage remained flat due to offsetting factors: an increase in QCT gross margin countered the negative impact of declining QTL licensing revenues, which are higher-margin. This shows that while both companies experienced margin pressures, the structural drivers behind those pressures were different, with Qualcomm relying more on QCT to offset the drop in QTL licensing revenue.",

      "answer": "Adobe's 2024 filing shows a 4% increase in compensation costs, which are explicitly tied to network operations, implementation, account management, and technical support personnel\u2014key components of their subscription revenue delivery. This increase contributes to higher cost of subscription revenue, signaling a focus on scaling operational headcount to support growth. In contrast, Oracle's 2023 filing defers detailed compensation disclosures to its 2024 proxy statement, indicating a more opaque or governance-driven approach to compensation reporting. The difference suggests Adobe prioritizes transparency around operational cost drivers, while Oracle maintains a more controlled disclosure framework aligned with corporate governance.",

        "Hop 1: ADBE \u2192 Compensation Costs: Adobe's cost of subscription revenue includes compensation costs for operations and support teams, showing direct alignment with service delivery.",

These charges reflect the financial impact of integrating Xilinx\u2019s workforce and retaining talent post-acquisition. In contrast, Cisco proactively manages its exposure to compensation charges\u2014likely arising from similar retention challenges\u2014by using derivatives like total return swaps to economically hedge these obligations, thereby offsetting potential compensation expenses. This suggests that while AMD recognized significant acquisition-driven compensation costs, Cisco employs financial instruments to mitigate such risks before they fully materialize on the income statement.",

However, our master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty.\n\nTo further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby cash is posted as collateral between the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument. Under these collateral security arrangements, the net cash collateral provided for was $11 million and $40 million as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n\n## (c) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nWe conduct business globally in numerous currencies. Therefore, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes, we enter into foreign currency contracts. We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.\n\nWe hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions related to certain revenues, operating expenses and service cost of sales with currency options and forward contracts.  These  currency  options  and  forward  contracts,  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges,  generally  have  maturities  of  less  than 24  months.  The  derivative instrument's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables, long-term customer financings and payables. These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments. G ains and losses on the contracts are  included  in  other  income  (loss),  net,  and  substantially  offset  foreign  ex change  gains  and  losses  from  the  remeasurement  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity.\n\nWe hedge certain net investments in our foreign operations with forward contracts to reduce the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our net investment in those foreign subsidiaries. These derivative instruments generally have maturities of up to six months.\n\n## (d) Interest Rate Risk\n\nWe hold an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge related to a fixed-rate senior note that is due in fiscal 2025. Under the interest rate swap, we receive fix ed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on SOFR plus a fixed number of basis points. The effect of the swap is to convert the fixed interest rate of the senior fix ed-rate note to a floating interest rate based on SOFR. The gain and loss related to the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is included in interest ex pense and substantially offsets the change in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt attributable to the change in market interest rates.\n\n## (e) Equity Price Risk\n\nWe hold marketable equity securities in our portfolio that are subject to price risk. To diversify our overall portfolio, we also hold equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. The change in the fair value of each of these investment types are included in other income (loss), net.\n\nWe  are  also  ex posed  to  variability  in  compensation  charges  related  to  certain  deferred  compensation  obligations  to  employees  and  directors.  Although  not designated as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense.",

We believ e that with the acquisition of ZT Systems, we can deliv er leadership training and inferencing solutions that can accelerate time to deployment for our AMD Instinct platforms. T he acquisition is expected to close in the first half of fiscal year 2025, subject to certain regulatory approv als and other customary closing conditions. We intend to seek a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems' manufacturing business.\n\nWe continued to inv est in driv ing software capabilities and the open ecosystem to deliv er powerful new features and capabilities in the AMD ROCm\u2122 open software stack, bringing the latest features to highly-performant AI training and inference on AMD platforms. During the year, we made sev eral key optimizations and additional features in the latest AMD  ROCm software that increases performance in key generativ e AI workloads, adds expanded support and optimization for additional frameworks and libraries, and simplifies the ov erall dev eloper experience.\n\n## Our Business\n\nOur four reportable segments are:\n\n- the Data Center segment, which primarily includes AI accelerators, serv er CPUs, GPUs, APUs, DPUs, FPGAs, SmartNICs, and Adaptiv e SoC products for data centers;\n- the Client segment, which primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks;\n- the Gaming segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and dev elopment serv ices; and\n- the Embedded segment, which primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, SOMs, and Adaptive SoC products.\n\nIn addition to these reportable segments, we hav e an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment.\n\nBeginning with our fiscal year ending December 27, 2025, we plan to combine the Client and Gaming segments into one reportable segment to align with how we manage our business. As a result, we will hav e three reportable segments: Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded.\n\n## Data Center Segment\n\n## Data Center Market\n\nThe Data Center segment primarily includes serv er-class CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs, SmartNICs, and Adaptiv e SoC products. We lev erage our technology to address the computational, v isual data processing and AI workload acceleration needs in the data center market. Modern data centers require high performance, energy efficient, scalable and adaptable compute engines to meet the demand driv en by the growing amount of data that needs to be stored, accessed, analyzed and managed. Different combinations of  CPUs,  GPUs,  DPUs,  FPGAs,  SmartNICs, and Adaptiv e SoCs enable the optimization of performance and power for a div erse set of workloads.\n\n## Data Center Products\n\nServer  CPUs. Our  CPUs  for  serv er  platforms  currently  include  the  AMD  EPYC  Series  processors.  EPYC  CPUs,  which  are  based  on  the  x86 architecture,  are  serv er-specific  processors  designed  for  high-performance  computing,  enterprise  IT ,  supercomputing,  and  large  data  centers.  We recently announced our 5th generation AMD EPYC family of serv er processors, further expanding our high-performance serv er CPU portfolio.\n\nData Center GPUs. Our AMD Instinct family of GPU accelerator products, including AMD Instinct MI200, MI300 and MI325 series, are based on AMD CDNA\u2122 architecture. AMD  Instinct  accelerators  are  designed  to  address  the  growing  demand  for  AI  training  and  inferencing  and  exascale-class scientific computing. Our v isual cloud GPU offerings include products in the Radeon\u2122 PRO V families. Our v isual cloud data center GPUs include a range of solutions tailored towards workloads requiring remote v isualization, such as Desktop-as-a-Serv ice, Workstation-as-a-Serv ice and Cloud Gaming.",

      "question": "How did the decline in average selling prices affect AMD's revenue strategy in relation to Cisco's APJC segment performance, given both companies' exposure to pricing pressures in 2024?",
      "answer": "AMD noted that the average selling price (ASP) of its products typically declines over time, and the introduction of new products with higher sale prices is necessary to maintain the overall corporate ASP. Failure to offset declining ASPs with new product introductions or increased unit sales could materially adversely affect AMD's business. Similarly, Cisco's APJC segment gross margin in 2023 was negatively impacted by pricing pressures, despite favorable product mix and productivity benefits. In 2024, Cisco's APJC segment balance stood at $5,382 million, indicating ongoing exposure to regional market dynamics, including pricing trends. Therefore, both companies face strategic challenges in managing revenue amidst downward pricing pressures, with AMD focusing on product innovation to stabilize ASPs and Cisco experiencing margin compression in APJC due to similar market forces.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Average Selling Price: AMD states that declining ASPs over time must be offset by new products with higher prices or increased volumes; otherwise, it could materially harm their business.",
        "Hop 2: Average Selling Price \u2192 APJC Segment: Cisco's APJC segment gross margin in 2023 was negatively impacted by pricing pressures, despite productivity gains and favorable product mix.",
        "Hop 3: APJC Segment \u2190 CSCO: Cisco's 2024 balance sheet shows the APJC segment balance at $5,382 million, indicating continued exposure to regional pricing and demand dynamics."

If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer's system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers' platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectiv ely market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adv ersely affect our business. The increasing frequency and complexity of our newly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could result in product delays. In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Ov er the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced ov er time.  T he introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the ov erall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales v olumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products ov er time, our business could be materially adv ersely affected.\n\n## The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business, and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our rev enue and receiv ables in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products, or has operations that are materially impaired for a significant period of time such that it is unable to receiv e or utilize our products, or pay its liabilities, our business would be materially adv ersely affected.\n\n## Economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\nUncertain global or regional economic conditions hav e and may in the future adv ersely impact our business. Uncertainty in the economic env ironment or other unfav orable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation, higher interest rates, recession, slowing growth, increased unemployment, tighter credit markets, changes in fiscal monetary or trade policy, or currency fluctuations, may negativ ely impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to stop or postpone purchases. For example, our Embedded segment rev enue decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize their inv entory lev els. During challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient rev enue or are unable  to  secure  financing,  they  may  not  be  able  to  pay,  or  may  delay  payment  of,  accounts  receiv able  that  they  owe  us.  T he  risk  related  to  our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our rev enue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adv ersely affect our earnings and cash flow . Moreov er, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolv ent, thereby adv ersely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. Adv erse changes in economic conditions could increase costs of memory, equipment, materials or substrates and other supply chain expenses. If we are not able to procure a stable supply of materials on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a supply shortage or an increase in production costs, which could negativ ely impact our gross margin and materially adv ersely affect  our  business.  Our  ability  to  forecast  our  operating  results,  make  business  decisions  and  execute  our  business  strategy  could  be  adv ersely impacted  by  challenging  macroeconomic  conditions.  In  addition,  uncertain  economic  conditions  could  lead  to  higher  borrowing  costs  and  reduced availability  of  capital  and  credit  markets,  making  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  raise  funds  through  borrowings  or  priv ate  or  public  sales  of  debt  or  equity securities. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty could also lead to failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments and declines in the v alue of our financial instruments. If a banking institution in which we hold funds fails or is subject to significant adv erse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we could be subject to a risk of loss of all or a portion of such uninsured funds or be subject to a delay in accessing all or a portion of such uninsured funds, which in turn could adv ersely impact our short-term liquidity and ability to meet our operating expense obligations.",

However, Adobe also includes usage-based and time-based revenue models for certain offerings, such as transaction-based advertising revenue recognized on a usage basis and maintenance and support offerings recognized ratably over the term, which contrasts with QCT's more uniform point-in-time recognition for equipment. This indicates similar but not identical revenue recognition timing for core product offerings between the two companies.",

These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and-materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Transaction-based advertising revenue is recognized on a usage basis as we satisfy the performance obligations to our customers.\n\n## Segments\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we categorized our products into the following reportable segments:\n\n- Digital Media -Our Digital Media segment provides products and services that enable individuals, teams, businesses, and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by transforming how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content. Our customers include creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers; communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; and consumers.\n- Digital Experience -Our Digital Experience segment provides an integrated platform and set of products, services and solutions that enable businesses to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer",

      "answer": "Adobe's Product Revenue fell by 14% year-over-year from $29 million in 2023 to $25 million in 2024, indicating a contraction in this revenue stream. In contrast, Qualcomm\u2019s QCT segment, which primarily recognizes equipment revenues at a point in time (as opposed to over time), likely experiences different revenue volatility patterns due to the timing of equipment sales. While Adobe\u2019s Product Revenue is a small and declining portion of its overall revenue model, Qualcomm\u2019s QCT segment is central to its business and follows a point-in-time recognition policy that may lead to more pronounced revenue fluctuations depending on product delivery cycles and market demand.",

      "answer": "AMD includes acquisition-related and other costs, such as transaction costs, purchase price adjustments, and contract termination charges, in its 'All Other' category, which is not a reportable segment. In contrast, NVIDIA specifically recorded a $1.4 billion acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction in fiscal year 2023, which was also included in its 'All Other' category as part of acquisition termination costs. While both companies report such expenses outside of their core operating segments, NVIDIA explicitly discloses the nature and amount of the termination cost, whereas AMD aggregates these expenses with other unallocated items.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA incurred a one-time $1,353 million acquisition termination cost in 2023 related to the failed ZT Systems acquisition, while AMD reported $583 million in acquisition-related and other costs during the same period. This means NVIDIA\u2019s single failed acquisition cost was more than double AMD\u2019s total acquisition-related expenses for the year. This comparison highlights the significantly higher financial risk NVIDIA took on with its ZT Systems acquisition attempt relative to AMD\u2019s M&A activities in 2023.",

        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 All Other Category: AMD\u2019s 'All Other' category includes acquisition-related and other costs, which totaled $583 million in 2023, reflecting the company\u2019s M&A activity expenses.",

      "answer": "AMD categorizes acquisition-related and other costs, including contract termination and workforce rebalancing charges, within its 'All Other' category, which is not a reportable segment and is excluded from performance evaluations by the CODM. In contrast, NVIDIA explicitly disclosed a $261 million acquisition termination cost in its 2023 tax expense reconciliation, indicating a specific and material charge related to acquisition termination that was not part of regular operating results. While AMD aggregates such costs into a broader non-segment category, NVIDIA isolates and quantifies the termination cost directly in its tax-related disclosures, highlighting different reporting approaches for significant non-operational acquisition expenses.",

      "answer": "AMD's amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased by $737 million (21%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to certain intangibles being fully amortized, which reduced expenses and improved financial metrics. This contrasts with TXN's consistent amortization approach, where acquisition-related intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic life, without specific mention of reductions or write-offs in 2023. The difference in amortization strategies highlights AMD's declining burden from past acquisitions versus TXN's stable long-term asset management.",

The increase in gross margin was due to a fav orable shift in rev enue mix of higher Data Center and Client rev enues, lower Gaming rev enue, partially offset by the impact of lower Embedded rev enue.\n\n## Expenses\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses of $6.5 billion in 2024 increased by $584 million, or 10%, compared to $5.9 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount in support of our AI strategy.\n\n## Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrativ e expenses of $2.8 billion in 2024 increased by $431 million, or 18%, compared to $2.4 billion in 2023. T he increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activ ities to support our rev enue growth.\n\n## Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.4 billion for 2024 decreased by $417 million, or 15%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2023. T he decrease was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles being fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.\n\n## Restructuring Charges\n\nWe recognized $186 million of restructuring charges in 2024 due to the implementation of a restructuring plan (the 2024 Restructuring Plan). The 2024 Restructuring Plan was focused on driv ing efficiencies across the business and aligning resources with our largest growth opportunities in the AI and enterprise markets.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nWe hold equity interests in two joint v entures (collectiv ely, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information T echnology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity.

      "question": "How does AMD's $417 million (15%) year-over-year decline in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles impact its operating margin trajectory compared to TXN's straight-line amortization approach, and what does this reveal about their respective asset valuation strategies and reinvestment capacity?",
      "answer": "AMD's amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased by $417 million (15%) from $2.8 billion in 2023 to $2.4 billion in 2024, primarily because certain intangibles from the Xilinx acquisition became fully amortized. This reduction directly improved AMD's operating margin trajectory as the non-cash expense burden decreased. In contrast, TXN utilizes a straight-line amortization method for its acquisition-related intangibles, which creates a more consistent expense pattern over time, preserving asset value stability on the balance sheet. AMD's declining amortization expense suggests greater reinvestment capacity as legacy acquisition assets mature, while TXN's approach indicates a longer-term, steady depreciation of intangible assets aligned with predictable cash flow generation. This reveals AMD's asset valuation strategy is more front-loaded with significant acquisition-driven amortization early on, whereas TXN manages intangibles with a smoother, more sustained impact on financial performance.",

        "Hop 2: Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles \u2192 Acquisition-Related Intangibles: The decline in amortization expense reflects that certain intangible assets have reached the end of their amortization schedules, directly tied to the original valuation and useful life assumptions of those assets.",

The increase in gross margin was due to a fav orable shift in rev enue mix of higher Data Center and Client rev enues, lower Gaming rev enue, partially offset by the impact of lower Embedded rev enue.\n\n## Expenses\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses of $6.5 billion in 2024 increased by $584 million, or 10%, compared to $5.9 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount in support of our AI strategy.\n\n## Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrativ e expenses of $2.8 billion in 2024 increased by $431 million, or 18%, compared to $2.4 billion in 2023. T he increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activ ities to support our rev enue growth.\n\n## Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.4 billion for 2024 decreased by $417 million, or 15%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2023. T he decrease was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles being fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.\n\n## Restructuring Charges\n\nWe recognized $186 million of restructuring charges in 2024 due to the implementation of a restructuring plan (the 2024 Restructuring Plan). The 2024 Restructuring Plan was focused on driv ing efficiencies across the business and aligning resources with our largest growth opportunities in the AI and enterprise markets.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nWe hold equity interests in two joint v entures (collectiv ely, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information T echnology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. We recognized $48 million and $34 million of licensing gain from royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, in 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely.",

      "answer": "Oracle spent $1,633 million on Research and Development (R&D) in 2022, while Texas Instruments allocated $457 million of its $1,863 million total R&D spending to the Embedded Processing segment in 2023. This indicates that Oracle dedicates a significantly larger absolute amount to R&D overall, which may reflect its broader investment in cloud and enterprise technologies. In contrast, Texas Instruments' focused allocation to Embedded Processing suggests a targeted investment strategy in this specific segment, aligning with its semiconductor product specialization.",

      "answer": "Oracle spent $1,633 million on R&D in fiscal 2022, while Texas Instruments allocated $457 million to R&D specifically for its Embedded Processing segment in 2023. Given that Texas Instruments operates Embedded Processing manufacturing sites across 15 global locations including China, India, Japan, and Mexico (as of 2022), the relatively lower R&D spend in this segment suggests a focus on scaling production and operational efficiency rather than breakthrough innovation, compared to Oracle\u2019s significantly higher investment in general R&D.",

      "answer": "Oracle spent $1,633 million on research and development in 2022, while Texas Instruments allocated $1,317 million to R&D specifically within its Analog segment during the same period. This indicates that both companies prioritize innovation, but Oracle dedicates a larger portion of its resources to R&D overall, whereas Texas Instruments focuses its R&D investment more narrowly within the Analog segment, which is central to its product portfolio. Given that Texas Instruments operates manufacturing facilities in key global locations like Dallas, Shanghai, and Bangalore, this R&D focus likely supports continued innovation in analog semiconductor technologies that are critical to its competitive positioning.",

      "question": "How does the growth in Salesforce's unearned revenue from cloud services compare to the increase in NVIDIA's income tax payable, and what might this imply about their respective cash tax obligations given the tax treatment of deferred revenue?",
      "answer": "Salesforce's unearned revenue grew from $19.003 billion in fiscal 2024 to $20.743 billion in fiscal 2025, an increase of $1.74 billion. This unearned revenue includes amounts from cloud services. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's income tax payable increased from $1.361 billion in fiscal 2024 to $2.188 billion in fiscal 2025, a rise of $827 million. According to NVIDIA's disclosures, part of its income tax payable includes tax obligations related to unearned revenue from support and cloud services. This suggests that as deferred revenue grows at companies like Salesforce, which is common in cloud-based business models, it may contribute to rising income tax liabilities at firms like NVIDIA, depending on how these revenues are recognized for tax purposes and the timing of cash tax payments.",

      "answer": "The increase in Salesforce's unearned revenue by $1,740 million from fiscal 2024 to 2025 could contribute to higher deferred tax liabilities, as unearned revenue is generally taxed when recognized for accounting purposes. According to NVIDIA's disclosures, unearned revenue related to hardware support, software support, and cloud services is linked to income tax payable, indicating that deferred revenue impacts tax liabilities when it is recognized. NVIDIA reported an increase in long-term income tax payable from $1,361 million to $2,188 million in fiscal 2025, which may reflect broader industry practices in recognizing tax liabilities associated with deferred revenue. This suggests that Salesforce may also face a similar deferred tax treatment on its growing unearned revenue, although the exact impact would depend on Salesforce's specific tax jurisdiction and accounting policies.",

Semiconductors, generally known as 'chips,' combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We hav e a div erse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as conv erting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other dev ices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improv ing signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes more than 80,000 products that are integral to almost ev ery type of electronic equipment.\n\nOur segments represent groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.\n\n## Analog\n\nOur Analog segment generated $12.16 billion of rev enue in 2024. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to prov ide the power to run dev ices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic dev ices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotiv e and personal electronics.\n\nSales of our Analog products generated about 78% of our rev enue in 2024.\n\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n\n## Power\n\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different v oltage lev els, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated DC/DC switching regulators, power switches, linear and low-dropout regulators, v oltage references, multiphase controllers and power stages, and lighting products.\n\n## Signal Chain\n\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or conv erted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data conv erters, interface products, motor driv es, clocks, logic and sensing products.\n\n## Embedded Processing\n\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $2.53 billion of rev enue in 2024. Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our dev ices v ary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex dev ices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotiv e.\n\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often inv est their own R&amp;D to write software that operates on our products. This inv estment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next.",

A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application dev elopers, and the platform prov ider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achiev e and maintain attractiv e margins.

Competitors pursuing this model also earn rev enue from serv ices integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their v ertically integrated offer. We also offer some v ertically-integrated hardware and software products and serv ices. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model may increase our cost of rev enue and reduce our operating margins.\n\n\u00b7 We derive substantial rev enue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new dev ices and form factors such as smartphones and tablets. These dev ices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceiv ed utility of the dev ice and its platform. Users continue to turn to these dev ices to perform functions that in the past were performed by PCs. Even if many users v iew these dev ices as complementary to a PC, the prev alence of these dev ices may make it more difficult to attract application dev elopers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or serv ices offered on competing platforms could increase their competitiv e strength. In addition, some of our dev ices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer ('OEM') partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.\n\n\u00b7 Competing platforms hav e content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The v ariety and utility of content and applications av ailable on a platform are important to dev ice purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to mov e data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist dev elopers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications hav e high quality, security, customer appeal, and v alue. Efforts to compete with competitors' content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of rev enue and lower our operating margins. Competitors' rules gov erning their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and serv ices through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectiv es.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\n## ITEM 1. Business\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we hav e design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. In 2024, we generated $15.64 billion of rev enue.\n\nFor decades, we hav e operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from v acuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each generation has become more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors are used by a growing number of customers and markets. Our passion continues to be aliv e today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications.\n\nFor many years, we hav e run our business with three ov erarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ev er changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. Our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable and env ironmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achiev ing these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.\n\nAs engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innov ate to create a better world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objectiv e and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term.\n\nOur strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\nThe first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitiv e advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made ov er the years and that continue today. The four sustainable competitiv e adv antages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and div ersity and longev ity of our products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitiv e advantages prov ide tangible benefits, are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitiv e adv antages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our inv estments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and lev eraging of these adv antages.\n\nThe second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, dev elop new capabilities, inv est in manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Ov er a 10-year period from 2015 to 2024, we allocated $101 billion, which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation ov er this period was to driv e organic growth, which includes inv estments in R&amp;D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inv entory. In this period, we allocated about $20 billion to capital expenditures. Our increased capital expenditures are to support future rev enue growth, which will be a greater component of free cash flow per share growth going forward. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to div idends and share repurchases. Div idends are designed to appeal to a broad set of inv estors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretiv e capture of future free cash flow for long-term inv estors. Lastly, for inorganic growth, we allocate to acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectiv es.\n\nThe third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striv ing for more output for ev ery dollar spent. This is about getting our inv estments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; it is not just about optimizing cost cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improv ement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to rev enue growth, improv ed gross margins, disciplined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth.",

      "answer": "In 2024, Microsoft's cost of revenue was $74.114 billion, representing 30.2% of its total revenue of $245.122 billion. In contrast, Texas Instruments' Analog segment had a cost of revenue of $4.869 billion, which was 40.1% of its $12.161 billion revenue. This implies that Microsoft's business model yields a significantly higher gross margin (71.8%) compared to Texas Instruments' Analog segment (59.9%), potentially reflecting differences in product mix, scale, and margin strategy between the two companies.",

We hav e a div erse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as conv erting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other dev ices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improv ing signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes more than 80,000 products that are integral to almost ev ery type of electronic equipment.\n\nOur segments represent groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.\n\n## Analog\n\nOur Analog segment generated $12.16 billion of rev enue in 2024. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to prov ide the power to run dev ices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic dev ices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotiv e and personal electronics.\n\nSales of our Analog products generated about 78% of our rev enue in 2024.\n\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n\n## Power\n\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different v oltage lev els, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated DC/DC switching regulators, power switches, linear and low-dropout regulators, v oltage references, multiphase controllers and power stages, and lighting products.\n\n## Signal Chain\n\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or conv erted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data conv erters, interface products, motor driv es, clocks, logic and sensing products.\n\n## Embedded Processing\n\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $2.53 billion of rev enue in 2024. Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our dev ices v ary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex dev ices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotiv e.\n\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often inv est their own R&amp;D to write software that operates on our products. This inv estment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next.",

Meanwhile, Texas Instruments' Embedded Processing segment, which generated $1,218 million in gross profit in 2024, demonstrates strong profitability and could provide TI with strategic flexibility. This contrast suggests that TI may be better positioned to maintain margins while supplying components for embedded systems, potentially giving it an edge in markets where hardware-software integration is critical but cost-sensitive.

RISK FACTORS\n\nOur operations and financial results are subject to v arious risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adv ersely affect our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and the trading price of our common stock.\n\n## STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\n\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Competition in the technology sector\n\nOur competitors range in size from div ersified global companies with significant research and dev elopment resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effectiv e in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete ev olv e rapidly with changing and disruptiv e technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and serv ices. If we do not continue to innov ate and prov ide products, dev ices, and serv ices that appeal to businesses and consumers, we may not remain competitiv e, which may adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Competition among platform-based ecosystems\n\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build div erse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application dev elopers, and the platform prov ider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achiev e and maintain attractiv e margins. We face significant competition from firms that prov ide competing platforms.\n\n\u00b7 A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related serv ices, has succeeded with some consumer products such as PCs, tablets, smartphones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint dev ices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn rev enue from serv ices integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their v ertically integrated offer. We also offer some v ertically-integrated hardware and software products and serv ices. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model may increase our cost of rev enue and reduce our operating margins.\n\n\u00b7 We derive substantial rev enue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new dev ices and form factors such as smartphones and tablets. These dev ices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceiv ed utility of the dev ice and its platform. Users continue to turn to these dev ices to perform functions that in the past were performed by PCs. Even if many users v iew these dev ices as complementary to a PC, the prev alence of these dev ices may make it more difficult to attract application dev elopers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or serv ices offered on competing platforms could increase their competitiv e strength. In addition, some of our dev ices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer ('OEM') partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.\n\n\u00b7 Competing platforms hav e content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The v ariety and utility of content and applications av ailable on a platform are important to dev ice purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to mov e data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist dev elopers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications hav e high quality, security, customer appeal, and v alue. Efforts to compete with competitors' content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of rev enue and lower our operating margins. Competitors' rules gov erning their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and serv ices through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectiv es.",

Meanwhile, Qualcomm's gross margin percentage remained flat, but this stability was maintained only through an increase in QCT gross margin that offset the negative impact of declining higher-margin QTL licensing revenues relative to QCT revenues. Thus, while Cisco managed an overall margin improvement despite productivity drags, Qualcomm faced structural margin pressures from a declining share of high-margin licensing revenue embedded in its business mix.",

This suggests rising licensing costs for 5G technologies across the industry. Cisco's gross margin percentage declined in 2022, with productivity challenges cited as a key negative factor. Given that gross margin pressures at Qualcomm were partly offset by higher-margin QTL licensing revenues, the broader industry trend of increasing 5G-related licensing costs could further strain Cisco's productivity-driven margin issues, especially if Cisco lacks equivalent high-margin revenue streams to offset these rising input costs.",

      "answer": "Despite a $308 million increase in estimated revenues per unit for QTL licensing in fiscal 2022 due to favorable 5G mix, Qualcomm's gross margin percentage remained flat year-over-year because the relative decline in higher-margin QTL licensing revenues (as a proportion of QCT revenues) offset gains in QCT gross margin.",

        "Hop 1: CSCO \u2192 Gross Margin Percentage: Cisco reported a decline in gross margin percentage from 64.0% to 62.5% in fiscal 2022, indicating margin pressure in its networking business.",
        "Hop 2: Gross Margin Percentage \u2192 QTL Licensing Revenues: Qualcomm noted that the flat gross margin percentage in fiscal 2022 was partly due to a decrease in the proportion of higher-margin QTL licensing revenues relative to QCT revenues.",
        "Hop 3: QTL Licensing Revenues \u2190 QCOM: QTL licensing revenues increased in fiscal 2022 by $308 million due to a favorable 5G unit mix, even though estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G multimode products decreased by $299 million."

      "answer": "CSCO achieved a 1.3 percentage point improvement in operating margin despite a decrease in gross margin percentage driven by productivity challenges. Meanwhile, QCOM maintained a flat gross margin percentage overall due to two offsetting factors: an increase in QCT's gross margin and a decrease in higher-margin QTL licensing revenues as a proportion of QCT revenues. This means while QCT improved its gross margin, the reduced contribution from QTL licensing prevented QCOM from seeing an overall gross margin improvement. CSCO's margin improvement came from revenue growth and lower restructuring charges, even though it faced its own gross margin pressures unrelated to QCOM\u2019s segmental mix.",

The related discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1.\n\nIn  February  2020,  we  issued  $500  million  of  senior  notes  due  February  1,  2023,  $500  million  of  senior  notes  due February 1, 2025, $850 million of senior notes due February 1, 2027, and $1.30 billion of senior notes due February 1, 2030. Our total  proceeds  of  approximately  $3.14  billion,  net  of  issuance  discount,  were  used  for  general  corporate  purposes  including repayment of debt instruments due in fiscal 2020. The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1.\n\nOur senior notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. We may redeem the notes at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The notes do not contain financial covenants but include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on assets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances.\n\n## Revolving Credit Agreement\n\nIn October 2018, we entered into a credit agreement ('Revolving Credit Agreement'), providing for a five-year $1 billion senior  unsecured  revolving  credit  facility,  which  replaced  our  previous  five-year  $1  billion  senior  unsecured  revolving  credit agreement dated as of March 2, 2012 (as amended, the 'Prior Revolving Credit Agreement'). In addition, we incurred issuance costs  of  $1  million  which  is  amortized  to  interest  expense  over  the  term  using  the  straight-line  method.  The  Revolving  Credit Agreement provides  for  loans  to Adobe  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries  that  may  be  designated  from  time  to  time  as  additional borrowers.  Pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  Revolving  Credit Agreement,  we  may,  subject  to  the  agreement  of  lenders  to  provide additional commitments, obtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.5 billion. At our election, loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.585% to 1.015% or (ii) a base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the agent's prime rate, (b) the  federal  funds  effective  rate  plus  0.500%  or  (c)  LIBOR  plus  1.00%  plus  a  margin,  based  on  our  debt  ratings,  ranging  from 0.000% to 0.015%. In addition, facility fees determined according to our debt ratings are payable on the aggregate commitments, regardless of usage, quarterly in an amount ranging from 0.04% to 0.11% per annum. We are permitted to permanently reduce the aggregate commitment under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any time. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Revolving Credit  Agreement,  Adobe  and  any  of  its  subsidiaries  designated  as  additional  borrowers  may  borrow,  prepay  and  re-borrow amounts at any time during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nThe  Revolving  Credit  Agreement  contains  customary  representations,  warranties,  affirmative  and  negative  covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger and acquisition transactions, dispositions and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant, based on a quarterly financial test, requires us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of December 3, 2021, we were in compliance with this covenant.\n\nThe facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on the maturity date unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b) the maturity date is further extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders.\n\nAs of December 3, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement.",

      "answer": "Adobe reported an 8% increase in compensation costs, driven in part by investments in R&D and hiring software developers to maintain competitiveness in its end markets and support its subscription and service offerings. This reflects a strategic emphasis on talent acquisition and development. In contrast, Cisco disclosed a total share-based compensation expense of $1,886 million in fiscal 2022, indicating a significant ongoing investment in employee compensation. While Adobe's increase is framed in the context of growth in R&D and product development, Cisco's larger absolute expense highlights a mature company's approach to sustaining talent across broader operational areas, including sales, marketing, and general administration.",

This was partially offset by the amortization of purchased intangible assets primarily related to Splunk, and negative impacts from pricing.\n\n## Supply Chain Impacts and Risks\n\nIn past periods, we took multiple actions in order to mitigate component shortages and address significant supply constraints. These supply constraints resulted in the need to secure long-term supply and increased inventory supply chain balances compared to historical levels. This in turn has significantly increased our supply chain exposure, which has resulted in negative impacts to our product gross margin in recent periods and may result in further negative impacts in future periods. This exposure includes potential material excess and obsolete or other charges if product demand significantly decreases for a sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or we are unable to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures.\n\n## Services Gross Margin\n\nOur services gross margin percentage increased by 1.7 percentage points primarily due to higher sales volume, lower headcount-related and delivery costs, lower variable compensation expense and favorable mix of service offerings.\n\nOur services gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.",

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Subscription, Product and Services Offerings\n\nWe enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloudhosted  offerings,  term-based,  royalty,  and  perpetual  software  licenses,  associated  software  maintenance  and  support  plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights,  or  options  to  either  renew  monthly  on-premise  term-based  licenses  or  use  committed  funds  to  purchase  other  Adobe products or services.\n\nFully  hosted  subscription  services  (SaaS)  allow  customers  to  access  hosted  software  during  the  contractual  term  without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.\n\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically  accounted  for  utilizing  the  'as-invoiced'  practical  expedient.  Revenue  for  subscriptions  sold  as  a  fee  per  period  is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.\n\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\n\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent  stand-ready  performance  obligations.  Revenue  from  these  subscription  support  plans  is  recognized  ratably  over  their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\n\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all  other  revenue  recognition  criteria  are  met,  and  classified  as  product  revenue  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income. Revenue  from  on-premise  term  license  or  term  licensing  arrangements  with  unilateral  cancellation  rights  or  monthly  renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\n\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.  Our  transaction-based  advertising  offerings,  where  fees  are  based  on  a  number  of  impressions  per  month  and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the 'asinvoiced' practical expedient.\n\n## Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both onpremise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services.

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Subscription, Product and Services Offerings\n\nWe enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloudhosted  offerings,  term-based,  royalty,  and  perpetual  software  licenses,  associated  software  maintenance  and  support  plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights,  or  options  to  either  renew  monthly  on-premise  term-based  licenses  or  use  committed  funds  to  purchase  other  Adobe products or services.\n\nFully  hosted  subscription  services  (SaaS)  allow  customers  to  access  hosted  software  during  the  contractual  term  without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.\n\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically  accounted  for  utilizing  the  'as-invoiced'  practical  expedient.  Revenue  for  subscriptions  sold  as  a  fee  per  period  is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.\n\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\n\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent  stand-ready  performance  obligations.  Revenue  from  these  subscription  support  plans  is  recognized  ratably  over  their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\n\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all  other  revenue  recognition  criteria  are  met,  and  classified  as  product  revenue  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income. Revenue  from  on-premise  term  license  or  term  licensing  arrangements  with  unilateral  cancellation  rights  or  monthly  renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\n\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.  Our  transaction-based  advertising  offerings,  where  fees  are  based  on  a  number  of  impressions  per  month  and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the 'asinvoiced' practical expedient.\n\n## Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both onpremise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services.

      "answer": "Cisco's services gross margin increased by 1.7 percentage points in FY2024, driven by higher sales volume, lower headcount-related and delivery costs, and favorable service mix. This improvement directly contributed to the Americas segment's gross margin growth, which Cisco attributed to 'higher services gross margin' alongside productivity benefits and favorable product mix. In contrast, Apple's segment reporting for the Americas focuses on net sales and operating income without disclosing gross margin details, and it emphasizes geographic alignment and market dynamics rather than service-specific performance metrics. Thus, while Cisco highlights services gross margin as a key driver in its Americas performance, Apple's segment strategy does not disclose or emphasize such granular margin contributions.",

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\n## Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company , including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company's hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\n## Note 13 - Segment Information and G eographic Data\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the A mericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of A sia Pacific. A mericas includes both North and South A merica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the M iddle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and T aiwan. Rest of A sia Pacific includes A ustralia and those A sian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. A lthough the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company's customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists  of  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales,  and  operating  ex penses  directly   attributable  to  the  segment.  The  information  prov ided  to  the Company's chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.",

Microsoft allocates revenue across segments based on relative value of products and services, often using actual prices charged or estimated costs plus margin.

          "chunk_text": "## CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Basis of Presentation\n\nThe fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the 'Company,' 'Cisco,' 'we,' 'us,' or 'our') is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday  in  July.  Fiscal  2022  and  fiscal  2020  were  each  52-week  fiscal  years,  and  fiscal  2021  was  a  53-week  fiscal  year.  The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have  been  eliminated.  We  conduct  business  globally  and  are  primarily  managed  on  a  geographic  basis  in  the  following  three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented. The share of earnings attributable  to  the  noncontrolling  interests  are  not  presented  separately  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  as  these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year's presentation. We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions.\n\n(b)  Available-for-Sale  Debt  Investments      We  classify  our  investments  in  fixed  income  securities  as  available-for-sale  debt investments.  Our  available-for-sale  debt  investments  primarily  consist  of  U.S.  government,  U.S.  government  agency,  non-U.S. government and agency, corporate debt, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale  debt  investments  sold.  These  investments  are  recorded  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  at  fair  value. Unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  these  investments  are  included  as  a  separate  component  of  accumulated  other  comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax. We classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n\n(c) Equity Instruments Our equity investments are accounted for as follows:\n\n- Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value through income.\n- Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost less  any  impairment,  plus  or  minus  changes  resulting  from  qualifying  observable  price  changes.  For  certain  of  these securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair value of these investments.\n- Equity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to exert significant influence over the investee. These investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n\n(d) Impairments of Investments   For our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. In this assessment, among other factors, we consider the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost,  any  changes  to  the  rating  of  the  security  by  a  rating  agency,  and  adverse  conditions  specifically  related  to  the  security.  If factors indicate a credit loss exists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded to other income (loss), net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The amount of fair value change relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\nWe hold non-marketable  equity  and  other  investments  ('privately  held  investments')  which  are  included  in  other  assets  in  the Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  We  monitor  these  investments  for  impairments  and  make  reductions  in  carrying  values  if  we determine  that  an  impairment  charge  is  required  based  primarily  on  the  financial  condition  and  near-term  prospects  of  these companies.",

However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.\n\nIn addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them.

      "answer": "Cisco's service revenue in the Americas segment declined by 2% in fiscal 2022, partly due to lower maintenance and advisory services revenue, which negatively impacted the average selling price in that segment. This pricing pressure was partially offset by productivity benefits and favorable product mix. Microsoft, on the other hand, allocates revenue across segments based on actual prices charged or estimated costs plus a profit margin, which suggests that if Microsoft faced similar regional pricing pressures, its revenue allocation methodology would adjust segment-level revenues accordingly, potentially mitigating or redistributing the impact of localized pricing challenges.",

Since QCOM's QCT segment recognized $9,777 million in revenue in fiscal 2022 and increased to $10,065 million by fiscal 2023, this growth trajectory may be vulnerable if AVGO's production issues lead to supply constraints.

In contrast, Qualcomm was the primary beneficiary of the Non-Arriver businesses acquired through the $4.7 billion Veoneer transaction, absorbing losses and receiving returns until the businesses were sold by SSW Partners. Qualcomm consolidated these businesses as held for sale and reported their results in discontinued operations, with proceeds from the sale of the Active Safety business amounting to $1.5 billion.",

      "answer": "ACN's Level 3 assets for fiscal 2021 were primarily invested in an insurance buy-in contract within a Non-U.S. plan, with fair value determined based on an actuarially calculated present value of the underlying liabilities. This approach reflects a long-term liability-driven strategy. In contrast, ADBE utilized fair value derivatives during fiscal 2021, which were recorded in prepaid expenses (for asset derivatives) and accrued expenses (for liability derivatives), indicating a more active hedging strategy to manage short-term financial exposures. While ACN's method focused on matching liabilities through actuarial valuation, ADBE's approach involved dynamic financial instruments to offset risk, suggesting differing strategies for managing fiscal exposure in their respective balance sheets.",

We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 721,000 as of August 31, 2022, compared to approximately 624,000 as of August 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we experienced a competitive labor market with high demand for the skills our people have, which contributed to elevated levels of voluntary attrition. For fiscal 2022, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 19%, up from 14% in fiscal 2021. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 20%, flat with 20% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.\n\nIn addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our people, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation has been and continues to increase faster than in prior years. In fiscal 2022, we have improved pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, across our business. While we are increasing pricing, as well as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology to reduce the impact of these compensation increases on our margin, the impact of these actions did not in fiscal 2022, and may not in the future, fully offset the impact of the compensation increases, resulting in lower contract profitability.\n\nOur ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisitionrelated costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisitionrelated costs.\n\nGross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2022 was 32.0%, compared with 32.4% for fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2022 was due to higher labor costs, including increased compensation and subcontractor costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs.\n\nSales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% for fiscal 2022, compared with 17.3% for fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, Sales and marketing costs decreased 60 basis points primarily due to lower selling and advertising costs as a percentage of revenues. General and administrative costs increased 10 basis points as a percentage of revenues.\n\nOperating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2022 was 15.2%, compared with 15.1% for fiscal 2021.",

This decrease occurred despite rising compensation costs, which were partially offset by pricing improvements and mix adjustments. In contrast, ADBE disclosed that General and Administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2022, with compensation and contracted costs being a primary component of this rise (ADBE_10k_2022.pdf). While ACN managed to reduce its Sales and Marketing costs as a percentage of revenue despite higher compensation expenses, ADBE experienced an increase in administrative costs, also driven by employee-related expenditures. The two companies responded differently to similar labor cost pressures, with ACN achieving cost efficiency in sales functions while ADBE saw administrative cost inflation.",

The  proceeds  of  these  issuances  were  or  will  be  used  for  general  corporate  purposes,  which  may include,  among  other  things,  funding  for  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  repurchases  of  capital  stock,  acquisitions,  and repayment of existing debt. In March 2021 and June 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. Refer to Note 11 - Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n## Unearned Revenue\n\nUnearned  revenue  comprises  mainly  unearned  revenue  related  to  volume  licensing  programs,  which  may  include  Software Assurance ('SA') and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year  agreements  and  recognized  ratably  over  the  coverage  period.  Unearned  revenue  also  includes  payments  for  other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.

      "question": "How might the deferral of revenue recognition on Microsoft's $193 billion unearned revenue as of June 30, 2022, impact the timing and tax treatment of future taxable income, especially when compared to how companies like NVIDIA account for tax liabilities on similar deferred revenue items such as hardware and software support?",
      "answer": "Microsoft disclosed that as of June 30, 2022, it had $193 billion in revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, including unearned revenue, with $189 billion from commercial customers. It expects to recognize about 45% of this over the next 12 months. This deferral impacts future taxable income timing, as taxes are generally due when revenue is recognized. NVIDIA\u2019s filings indicate that unearned revenue from hardware support, software support, and cloud services is linked to its income tax payable, which was $980 million as of January 30, 2022. This implies that as unearned revenue is recognized, it flows through to taxable income and increases tax liabilities. Therefore, Microsoft\u2019s large unearned revenue base suggests a significant future tax liability will be triggered as revenue is recognized, similar to how NVIDIA accounts for deferred revenue in its tax calculations.",

      "question": "How might the $5,109 million increase in Microsoft's unearned revenue in fiscal 2022 relate to NVIDIA's $980 million income tax payable, and what could this imply about the timing of revenue recognition and associated tax obligations in their financial reporting?",
      "answer": "Microsoft reported a $5,109 million change in unearned revenue in fiscal 2022, indicating a significant deferral of revenue, particularly related to hardware support, software support, and cloud services. This deferral likely impacts taxable income in the period, as unearned revenue is typically recognized for tax purposes when it is invoiced or received. NVIDIA\u2019s $980 million income tax payable as of January 30, 2022, includes long-term liabilities such as unrecognized tax benefits and transition tax obligations, which may be influenced by the timing and recognition of deferred revenues like those seen at Microsoft. Together, these figures suggest that both companies manage cash flows and tax liabilities through deferred revenue structures, with NVIDIA\u2019s tax obligations reflecting a more long-term treatment of these timing differences.",

In contrast, Intel Foundry Services recorded an operating loss of $482 million in 2023, reflecting ongoing challenges in scaling its foundry business. By 2024, Intel had fully impaired its Intel Foundry segment, writing off its value after continued losses and operational transfers.

      "answer": "AMD's Data Center operating income grew from $1,267 million in 2023 to $3,482 million in 2024, representing a significant increase of $2,215 million. In contrast, Intel reported an operating loss of $530 million in its Data Center and AI segment for 2024, down from a $1,300 million operating income in 2023, indicating a swing of $1,830 million in the negative direction. This divergence suggests that AMD is strengthening its position in the Data Center and AI market, while Intel is facing operational challenges or strategic misalignments in the same segment.",

        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Total Operating Income: AMD's Data Center operating income increased from $1,267 million in 2023 to $3,482 million in 2024, showing strong growth in this segment.",
        "Hop 2: Total Operating Income \u2192 Data Center and AI: Intel's Data Center and AI segment shifted from a positive operating income of $1,300 million in 2023 to a loss of $530 million in 2024, reflecting a significant deterioration in performance.",
        "Hop 3: Data Center and AI \u2190 INTC: Intel's 2024 10-K confirms its Data Center and AI segment had a negative operating income of $530 million, down from $1,300 million the prior year, highlighting strategic or operational difficulties."

      "answer": "AMD experienced a significant increase in Total Operating Income, rising from $401 million in 2023 to $1,900 million in 2024, driven largely by strong performance in its Data Center segment. In contrast, Intel's Network and Edge segment reported an operating loss of $482 million in 2023, down from a profit of $1,033 million in 2022. This decline occurred against the backdrop of Intel's 2024 strategic reorganization, which implemented an internal foundry model and moved its programmable solutions (formerly part of DCAI) into the 'All other' category. This restructuring was designed to improve transparency and efficiency but may have shifted focus and resources away from the Network and Edge segment, potentially contributing to its weakened financial performance. The divergent trajectories highlight AMD\u2019s growing profitability and Intel\u2019s operational challenges during a period of internal strategic transformation.",

A n estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Note 3 : Operating Segments\n\nWe previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to external customers. Both businesses utiliz e marketing, sales, and other support functions.\n\nOur internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate A ltera as a standalone business. A ltera was previously included in our DCAI segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \"all other.\" A s a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. A ll prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODMs internally receive information and manage and monitor our operating segment performance. There are no changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any prior periods.\n\nWe organize our business as follows:\n\n- Intel Products:\n- Client Computing Group (CCG)\n- Data Center and AI (DCAI)\n- Network and Edge (NEX)\n- Intel Foundry\n- All other:\n- Altera\n- Mobileye\n- Other\n\nCCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX , A ltera, and M obileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose certain of their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.\n\nThe accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A  summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:\n\n## Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX\n\n- Segment revenue: Consists of revenues from external customers. Our Intel Products operating segments represent most of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.\n- Segment expenses: Consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n68",

      "answer": "Apple's Europe segment operating income could face significant pressure if it encountered similar delivery inefficiencies as Accenture's European operations. Apple evaluates segment performance based on net sales and operating income that excludes asset information, with operating income consisting of sales, cost of sales, and directly attributable operating expenses. Accenture's Europe operating income growth was partially offset by lower contract profitability in fiscal 2022, driven by challenges in accurately forecasting effort and costs for engagements, performance-based compensation structures, and third-party delivery risks. If Apple faced similar issues in its Europe operations - particularly considering its reliance on outsourcing partners and custom components - its operating income could be materially affected through increased costs or delayed revenue realization, especially given Apple's Europe segment already operates under complex geographic dynamics that include India, the Middle East, and Africa.",

This pricing strategy could have contributed to upstream cost pressures for technology companies relying on these components, potentially influencing the 'negative impacts from pricing' specifically noted in Cisco\u2019s APJC segment gross margin performance, which cited pricing as a counteracting factor despite favorable product mix and productivity benefits.",

      "question": "Given AMD's 57% increase in average selling price driven by Ryzen and Radeon products, how might this pricing strategy impact Cisco's APJC segment gross margin, which already cites pricing pressures as a partial offset to margin improvements?",
      "answer": "AMD's 57% increase in average selling price, driven by a richer mix of Ryzen, Radeon, and AMD Instinct products, could potentially amplify pricing pressures in the supply chain. Since Cisco's APJC segment acknowledges that its gross margin improvements were partially offset by negative impacts from pricing, this suggests that increased component costs\u2014potentially including AMD's products\u2014may be contributing to margin pressures. If Cisco relies on AMD components in its networking or collaboration products offered in the APJC region, the increased input costs could constrain Cisco's ability to maintain or improve gross margins in that segment without passing on costs to customers.",

Business\n\n## General\n\nCisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that power the Internet. We are integrating our platforms across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud. These platforms are designed to help our customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks. This will enable us to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business.\n\nWe conduct  our  business  globally  and  manage  our  business  by  geography.  Our  business  is  organized  into  the  following  three geographic segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\n\nOur  products  and  technologies  are  grouped  into  the  following  categories:  Secure,  Agile  Networks;  Internet  for  the  Future; Collaboration; End-to-End Security; Optimized Application Experiences; and Other Products. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service offerings, including technical support services and advanced services. Increasingly, we are delivering  our  technologies  through  software  and  services.  Our  customers  include  businesses  of  all  sizes,  public  institutions, governments, and service providers, including large webscale providers. These customers often look to us as a strategic partner to help them use information technology (IT) to differentiate themselves and drive positive business outcomes.\n\nWe were incorporated in California in 1984 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2021. Our headquarters are in San Jose, California. The mailing address of our headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134-1706, and our telephone number at that location is (408) 526-4000. Our website is www.cisco.com. Through a link on the Investor Relations section of our website, we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  at  sec.gov:  our Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  Quarterly  Reports  on  Form  10-Q, Current  Reports  on  Form  8-K,  and  any  amendments  to  those  reports  or  other  information  filed  or  furnished  pursuant  to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

      "answer": "The decline in AMD's Gaming Segment contribution to Q4 2023 revenue, which dropped to 18% from 16% year-over-year, highlights the impact of weakening consumer demand and macroeconomic headwinds on tech spending. This aligns with CSCO's stated sensitivity to macroeconomic pressures, where they noted that factors like rising inflation, geopolitical instability, and global economic challenges have led to reduced IT-related capital spending by customers. Given that both companies operate in the broader technology ecosystem, the observed decline in AMD's gaming segment revenue serves as a real-world example of the type of market softness CSCO referenced, reinforcing the interconnectivity of macroeconomic conditions and tech sector performance.",

Any  of  the  foregoing  factors,  or  any  other  factors  discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.\n\n## Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.\n\nChallenging economic conditions, including rising inflation, or other changes, worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well; increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products; risk of excess  and  obsolete  inventories;  risk  of  supply  constraints;  risk  of  excess  facilities  and  manufacturing  capacity;  and  higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.\n\nThe global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent, and is being significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In certain prior periods, we have seen a broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which has impacted and could impact in the future certain of our markets. Additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the  world  (including  as  a  result  of  the  on-going  Russia  and  Ukraine  war,  and  China-Taiwan  relations),  the  current  economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain  uncertain  or  deteriorate  further,  we  may  experience  material  impacts  on  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial condition.\n\nOur operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers' perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products  in  the  United  States.  Trust  and  confidence  in  us  as  an  IT  supplier  are  critical  to  the  development  and  growth  of  our markets.  Impairment  of  that  trust,  or  foreign  regulatory  actions  taken  in  response  to  reports  of  certain  intelligence  gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\n\n## Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\n\nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment (including as a result of the Russia and Ukraine war), the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and related market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods, as it did in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 on a year-over-year basis, or decline as it did in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and certain prior periods. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have  exceeded  net  bookings  or  manufacturing  issues  have  delayed  shipments,  leading  to  nonlinearity  in  shipping  patterns.  In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can",

      "answer": "AVGO's cost of revenue was 33% of net revenue in fiscal 2022, resulting in a gross margin of 67%. In contrast, TXN's Analog segment achieved a gross margin of 60% in 2024, with cost of revenue at 40% of segment revenue.

No end customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2021 or 2019.\n\n## 2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar and share amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are presented in millions unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods' financial statements to conform to the 2021 presentation.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary.\n\n## Significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, and recognize revenue when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products.\n\nRevenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and transfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products' disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products.\n\nThe revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns , incentives and credit losses. We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties.\n\n## Advertising costs\n\nWe expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $27 million, $28 million and $30 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\n## Other assessed taxes\n\nSome transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.",

      "answer": "The gross profit margin contribution from the Embedded Processing segment at TXN is $1,218 million, which represents approximately 48% of the segment's revenue ($2,533 million). In contrast, AVGO's amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $2,847 million, which accounts for 8% of its total net revenue ($33,203 million). This suggests that while TXN's Embedded Processing segment contributes significantly to gross profit with relatively low amortization costs, AVGO incurs higher amortization expenses relative to its revenue, potentially impacting its operational efficiency. The difference highlights contrasting capital structures and acquisition strategies between the two companies.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

      "question": "How does AVGO's cost of revenue as a percentage of semiconductor revenue compare with TXN's Analog segment cost of revenue as a percentage of segment revenue, and what might this indicate about their relative manufacturing efficiency in similar product lines?",
      "answer": "AVGO's total cost of revenue in fiscal year 2022 was 33% of total net revenue, with $7,629 million attributed to products sold. In contrast, TXN's Analog segment reported a cost of revenue of $4,869 million, which was 40% of its segment revenue ($12,161 million) in 2024. This suggests that AVGO may have a more efficient manufacturing or cost management structure in its semiconductor operations compared to TXN's Analog segment, where a higher percentage of revenue is consumed by cost of revenue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 Cost of Revenue: AVGO's cost of products sold was $7,629 million, representing 23% of total net revenue in fiscal 2022.",

        "Hop 3: Analog Segment \u2190 TXN: The Analog segment is a core business unit of TXN, focused on power and signal chain semiconductor products, which are comparable to parts of AVGO's semiconductor business."

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

      "question": "How does the cost of revenue percentage for AVGO's products in FY2022 compare to the gross profit margin percentage of the Analog segment at TXN, given AVGO's product cost structure and TXN's segment-level profitability?",
      "answer": "AVGO's cost of products sold was 23% of net revenue in FY2022, resulting in a gross margin of 67% for its products. In contrast, TXN's Analog segment had a gross profit margin of 60% in FY2024, calculated from its $12,161 million in revenue and $4,869 million in cost of revenue. This indicates that AVGO maintained a higher gross margin on its product sales compared to TXN's Analog segment, despite both being in the semiconductor industry.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 Cost of Revenue: AVGO's cost of products sold was $7,629 million in FY2022, which represented 23% of its $26,277 million in product revenue, leading to a product-level gross margin of 67%.",
        "Hop 2: Cost of Revenue \u2192 Analog Segment: TXN's Analog segment had a cost of revenue of $4,869 million in FY2024 on revenue of $12,161 million, resulting in a gross profit of $7,292 million, or 60% of revenue.",
        "Hop 3: Analog Segment \u2190 TXN: The Analog segment was the largest contributor to TXN's revenue in FY2024, and historically in FY2021, it accounted for 77% of total company revenue, showing its strategic importance and consistent performance over time."

          "chunk_text": "We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\n## Product information\n\nSemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as 'chips,' combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have a diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes approximately 80,000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic equipment.\n\nOur segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.\n\n## Analog\n\nOur Analog segment generated $14.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic devices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and personal electronics.\n\nSales of our Analog products generated about 77% of our revenue in 2021.\n\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n\n## Power\n\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated controllers and converters, power switches, linear regulators, voltage references and lighting products.\n\n## Signal Chain\n\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks, logic and sensing products.\n\n## Embedded Processing\n\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $3.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive.\n\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&amp;D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next.",

      "question": "How does the proportion of royalty expenses within cost of revenue for Adobe compare to the gross margin contribution of Texas Instruments' Analog segment, and what might this indicate about their respective cost structures in technology product development?",
      "answer": "Adobe reported royalty expenses of $202 million in fiscal 2021, which is a significant portion of its cost of revenue and directly impacts gross margin. In contrast, Texas Instruments' Analog segment generated $7,292 million in gross profit from $12,161 million in revenue, indicating a more product-driven cost structure with higher gross margins. This comparison suggests that Adobe's reliance on licensed technologies incurs recurring royalty costs that shape its cost of revenue differently than Texas Instruments\u2019 manufacturing-based cost structure in its Analog segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ADBE \u2192 Cost of Revenue: Adobe discloses royalty expenses of $202 million in fiscal 2021, which are recorded directly in cost of revenue and represent a recurring cost tied to product licensing.",
        "Hop 2: Cost of Revenue \u2192 Analog Segment: Texas Instruments' Analog segment reports a gross profit of $7,292 million after subtracting $4,869 million in cost of revenue, which includes manufacturing and production-related expenses rather than licensing fees.",
        "Hop 3: Analog Segment \u2190 TXN: The Analog segment is a core part of Texas Instruments' business, contributing the majority of the company's total revenue ($12,161 million out of $15,641 million in 2024), and operates with a significantly higher gross margin compared to Adobe's cost-heavy revenue model."

          "chunk_text": "\n## Royalties\n\nWe have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $202 million, $176 million and $154 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions  have  not  been  significant  and  we  are  unable  to  estimate  the  maximum  potential  impact  of  these  indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\n\nTo  the  extent  permitted  under  Delaware  law,  we  have  agreements  whereby  we  indemnify  our  officers  and  directors  for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nIn  connection  with  disputes  relating  to  the  validity  or  alleged  infringement  of  third-party  intellectual  property  rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation.  Intellectual  property  disputes  and  litigation  may  be  very  costly  and  can  be  disruptive  to  our  business  operations  by diverting  the  attention  and  energies  of  management  and  key  technical  personnel.  Although  we  have  successfully  defended  or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property  disputes  could  subject  us  to  significant  liabilities,  require  us  to  enter  into  royalty  and  licensing  arrangements  on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting  our  sale  of  products  or  services,  cause  severe  disruptions  to  our  operations  or  the  markets  in  which  we  compete,  or require  us  to  satisfy  indemnification  commitments  with  our  customers  including  contractual  provisions  under  various  license arrangements and service agreements.",

No end customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2021 or 2019.\n\n## 2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar and share amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are presented in millions unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods' financial statements to conform to the 2021 presentation.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary.\n\n## Significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, and recognize revenue when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products.\n\nRevenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and transfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products' disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products.\n\nThe revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns , incentives and credit losses. We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties.\n\n## Advertising costs\n\nWe expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $27 million, $28 million and $30 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\n## Other assessed taxes\n\nSome transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.",

      "answer": "ADBE's cost of revenue increased from $55 million in 2019 to $70 million in 2021, representing a 27.3% increase over two years. In contrast, TXN's Analog Segment reported a cost of revenue of $4,869 million in 2024, which is significantly larger in scale. However, TXN's cost of revenue for this segment represents 40.1% of its total revenue ($12,161 million), indicating a more mature and hardware-intensive business model compared to ADBE's software-centric operations. Additionally, TXN's Analog Segment accounts for 74.4% of TXN's total cost of revenue in 2024, highlighting its central role in the company's cost structure. This contrast reveals that ADBE maintains a lower and more stable cost base aligned with its SaaS business model, while TXN's cost structure reflects the capital intensity of semiconductor manufacturing.",

      "answer": "Adobe reported royalty expenses of $202 million in fiscal 2021, which is part of its cost of revenue and reflects licensing costs associated with its products. In contrast, Texas Instruments reported a total cost of revenue of $1,315 million for its Embedded Processing segment in 2024. This suggests that while Adobe's royalty costs represent a smaller, defined portion of its cost of revenue, Texas Instruments incurs significantly higher direct costs in its Embedded Processing segment, which likely includes manufacturing, design, and development expenses for its embedded processors. This indicates differing cost structures: Adobe's are more influenced by licensing obligations, whereas Texas Instruments' are driven by the production and development of embedded semiconductor solutions.",

Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions  have  not  been  significant  and  we  are  unable  to  estimate  the  maximum  potential  impact  of  these  indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\n\nTo  the  extent  permitted  under  Delaware  law,  we  have  agreements  whereby  we  indemnify  our  officers  and  directors  for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nIn  connection  with  disputes  relating  to  the  validity  or  alleged  infringement  of  third-party  intellectual  property  rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation.  Intellectual  property  disputes  and  litigation  may  be  very  costly  and  can  be  disruptive  to  our  business  operations  by diverting  the  attention  and  energies  of  management  and  key  technical  personnel.  Although  we  have  successfully  defended  or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property  disputes  could  subject  us  to  significant  liabilities,  require  us  to  enter  into  royalty  and  licensing  arrangements  on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting  our  sale  of  products  or  services,  cause  severe  disruptions  to  our  operations  or  the  markets  in  which  we  compete,  or require  us  to  satisfy  indemnification  commitments  with  our  customers  including  contractual  provisions  under  various  license arrangements and service agreements.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&amp;D tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, and international realignments. Our effective tax rate was 15.6%, 17.7%, and 18.4% in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax  outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in  which  such  determination  is  made.  The  provision  for  income  tax es  includes  the  impact  of  reserve  provisions  and  changes  to  reserves  that  are  considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\n\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. If we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreignderived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax, research and development capitalization and amortization, and corporate alternative minimum tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of ex penses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The OECD, an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes, including a Pillar Two framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction, and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.",

      "answer": "Cisco reported financial pressures tied to its operating profit, including volatility from tax impacts such as its 15.6% effective tax rate in fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, Texas Instruments' Analog segment generated $12.16 billion in revenue, contributing 78% of its total revenue, with operating profit of $4,608 million for that segment. This strong performance in analog semiconductors, particularly in industrial and automotive markets, positions TI favorably compared to Cisco, which faces greater exposure to tax volatility and uncertain returns on intangible assets. TI\u2019s focused business model and high-margin analog segment contrast with Cisco\u2019s broader financial challenges, including impairment risks and unpredictable tax outcomes.",

Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate v alue.\n\n## Product information\n\nSemiconductors are electronic components that serv e as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as 'chips,' combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We hav e a div erse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as conv erting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other dev ices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improv ing signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes more than 80,000 products that are integral to almost ev ery type of electronic equipment.\n\nOur segments represent groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.\n\n## Analog\n\nOur Analog segment generated $12.16 billion of rev enue in 2024. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to prov ide the power to run dev ices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic dev ices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotiv e and personal electronics.\n\nSales of our Analog products generated about 78% of our rev enue in 2024.\n\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n\n## Power\n\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different v oltage lev els, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated DC/DC switching regulators, power switches, linear and low-dropout regulators, v oltage references, multiphase controllers and power stages, and lighting products.\n\n## Signal Chain\n\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or conv erted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data conv erters, interface products, motor driv es, clocks, logic and sensing products.\n\n## Embedded Processing\n\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $2.53 billion of rev enue in 2024. Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our dev ices v ary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex dev ices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotiv e.\n\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often inv est their own R&amp;D to write software that operates on our products. This inv estment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next.",

      "answer": "ACN's sales and marketing costs are primarily driven by compensation for business development, and the company has undertaken geographic restructuring\u2014such as moving Latin America from Growth Markets to North America\u2014suggesting a strategic effort to optimize regional alignment and potentially control costs. In contrast, ADBE reports that general and administrative expenses, which include compensation and contracted costs for administrative functions like human resources and legal, have increased. While both companies highlight compensation as a major cost driver, ACN appears to be managing development costs through geographic realignment, whereas ADBE\u2019s administrative cost increases suggest a different cost structure focus.",

      "answer": "ACN's sales and marketing costs in fiscal 2024 are primarily driven by compensation costs tied directly to business development activities, reflecting a current expense model aligned with revenue-generating efforts. In contrast, ADBE recognizes compensation costs for stock-based awards, including restricted stock units and performance shares, over the vesting or performance periods (e.g., $2.93 billion of unrecognized compensation cost to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.19 years). This creates a lagged expense recognition pattern that smooths financial impact over time. As a result, ACN\u2019s expense profile is more immediately sensitive to changes in business development activity levels, while ADBE\u2019s compensation costs are more back-loaded and insulated from short-term fluctuations, providing different financial reporting dynamics and strategic planning implications for each company.",

The estimated compensation cost is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.\n\nCompensation costs for our performance share awards which are contingent upon achievement of relative total stockholder return are recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite performance period or service period of the entire award, whichever is longer. Compensation costs for our performance share awards which are contingent upon achievement of revenue-based financial metrics are recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, based upon the expected levels of achievement, which are assessed periodically until certification by the ECC.\n\nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.\n\nAs of November 29, 2024, there was $2.93 billion of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock-based awards and purchase rights which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.19 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.",

Meanwhile, ADBE reported a 4% increase in compensation costs in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year, signaling a strategic focus on investing in talent.

This dynamic aligns with ADBE's experience, where rising compensation costs\u2014especially to retain talent in competitive fields like AI and cybersecurity\u2014have placed upward pressure on sales and marketing budgets.

We are increasingly offering end-to-end solutions that include cross-cloud and generative AI capabilities, which have in the past, and may in the future, increase the complexity of technical or contractual assurances or requirements that we or our customers require as part of the contracting process, leading to extended sales cycles. We may be required to submit more robust proposals, participate in ex tended proof-of-concept evaluation cycles and engage in more extensive contract negotiations. In addition, our enterprise customers often demand more complex configurations and additional integration services and product features. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have caused, and may continue to cause, additional spend scrutiny and delays in our enterprise customers' purchasing decisions. Due to these factors, we often must devote greater sales support to certain enterprise customers, which increases our costs and time required to complete a sale, without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. We also may be required to devote more services resources to implementation, which increases our costs, without assurance that customers receiving these services will renew or renew at the same level. Since the sales cycles for our enterprise offerings are multi-phased and complex, it is often unpredictable when a given sales cycle will close. Our revenue from enterprise customers may be affected by longer-than-expected sales, contract negotiation and implementation cycles, extended collection cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing arrangements. Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been, and is expected to remain, uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarter's total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry.\n\n## If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed, and our hybrid work model may present challenges, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management and highly skilled personnel across all levels  of  our  organization.  Our  senior  management  has  acquired  specialized  knowledge  and  skills  with  respect  to  our  business,  and  the  loss  of  any  of  these individuals could harm our business, especially if we are not successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our efforts to attract, develop, integrate and retain highly skilled employees may be compounded by intensified restrictions on immigration or the availability of work visas. The technology industry has been and may continue to be subject to substantial and continuous competition for talent, particularly with AI and cybersecurity backgrounds, and demand for cutting-edge or unique skill sets may continue to be highly competitive, both of which are heightened with hybrid or remote working arrangements. Our hybrid work environment may also present operational, security and workplace culture challenges, which could negatively affect our ability to execute against our business objectives and retain and recruit personnel. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, higher compensation costs to retain and recruit senior management or highly skilled personnel that may not be offset by innovation, improved productivity or increased sales. We continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower costs, which increases the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel-related expenditures. Nonetheless, as globalization continues, competition for talent in those countries has increased, which may impact our ability to retain these employees and increase our compensation-related expenses.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws and Regulations\n\n## We are, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, regulatory inquiries and other claims, which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\n\nWe are, and may in the future become, subject to various legal proceedings (including class action lawsuits), claims, negotiations and regulatory inquiries and additional claims, enforcement actions and inquiries may arise in the future, such as those relating to antitrust, data privacy and security, consumer protection, product liability and the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, among others. Such activity has increased over time with evolving regulatory landscapes and as our products, services and solutions have become more available to, and used by, more enterprises and consumers. For example, there is an increase in enforcement activity in connection with federal and state consumer protection laws, including some suits which seek civil penalties. Any proceedings, actions, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be highly time consuming; result in costly litigation,  damage  awards,  consent  decrees,  injunctive  relief  or  increased  costs  of  business;  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  or  products;  result  in negative publicity; require significant amounts of management time; result in the diversion of significant operational resources; or otherwise harm our business and financial results.\n\nDisputes and litigation can be complex and are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention of management and key personnel. For example, third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from offering certain products, services or solutions, subject us to injunctions restricting our sales, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy",

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usage-based royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of November 3, 2024 were approximately $20.5 billion. We expect approximately 43% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. For contracts with termination for convenience rights, our customers generally do not exercise those rights. In addition, the majority of our revenue is from contracts with a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods.\n\n## 4. Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the VMware Merger. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger was indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash or 2.52 shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis). The stockholder election was prorated, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, in each case, was equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger. Based on the VMware stockholders' elections, the VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock with a fair value of $53,398 million.\n\nWe funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Term Loans, as defined and discussed in Note 10. 'Borrowings', as well as cash on hand. We assumed $8,250 million of VMware's outstanding senior unsecured notes.\n\n## Purchase Consideration\n\n",

In contrast, Texas Instruments actively incorporates disposition-related gains and losses into its 'Other' segment, which reported $1.11 billion in revenue in 2023 and $947 million in 2024, using this segment as a financial buffer to absorb transitional impacts such as restructuring charges and asset disposition gains or losses.

      "answer": "CRM's subscription and support revenues grew primarily due to volume-driven increases from new business, with pricing not being a significant driver (7% of revenue from term licenses in fiscal 2024). This reflects a recurring revenue model that emphasizes customer acquisition and expansion over price increases. In contrast, INTC experienced significant volatility in their financial performance, as seen in the observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, which were $17 million in 2023 compared to $299 million in 2022. This decline suggests deteriorating market conditions affecting the valuation of Intel's equity investments. The contrast highlights CRM's more stable, customer-centric revenue recognition strategy versus INTC's exposure to market-driven valuation adjustments on investments, which can lead to greater financial unpredictability during economic uncertainty.",

      "answer": "CRM's subscription and support revenues, which made up 93% of total revenue in fiscal 2024, saw no significant contribution from pricing changes, indicating a volume-driven growth model focused on customer acquisition and expansion rather than price increases. In contrast, Intel disclosed $17 million in observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities for 2023, suggesting active management of strategic investments and potential shifts in valuation assumptions for private assets. This contrast highlights CRM's reliance on scaling customer base and contract volume within a relatively stable pricing framework, versus Intel's exposure to investment portfolio volatility that directly impacts financial reporting through price adjustments, reflecting divergent core strategies centered on SaaS scalability versus semiconductor innovation and investment diversification.",

      "answer": "Salesforce's subscription and support revenues grew due to volume-driven increases from new business, including new customers, upgrades, and additional subscriptions, with pricing not being a significant driver\u2014highlighting a strategy focused on customer acquisition and expansion rather than price increases. In contrast, Intel reported significant volatility in observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, with values of $17 million in 2023, down sharply from $299 million in 2022, indicating substantial sensitivity to market conditions in Intel's investment portfolio. This contrast suggests that Salesforce\u2019s revenue model is more insulated from direct market valuation shifts, while Intel\u2019s financials show greater exposure to external market fluctuations through its equity investments.",

In contrast, Intel reported observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities of $17 million in 2023, a significant decline from $299 million in 2022, indicating a reduction in valuation pressure on these investments year-over-year.",

      "answer": "Adobe provides AI-driven analytics tools such as Adobe Analytics and Real-Time Customer Data Platform that help businesses optimize marketing activities by delivering real-time insights and enabling data-driven decisions to improve marketing spend. In contrast, Qualcomm's QCT segment, which generated $33.2 billion in fiscal 2024, incurs financial obligations through customer incentive arrangements that include cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities. These incentives are treated as reductions to revenue and require complex estimation and accounting, particularly due to variable consideration in contracts. This shows that while Adobe enables marketing efficiency through data, Qualcomm directly finances marketing-related activities through contractual rebates and incentives.",

        "Hop 1: ADBE \u2192 Marketing Activities: Adobe offers AI-powered analytics tools (e.g., Adobe Analytics, Real-Time Customer Data Platform) that help businesses improve and direct their marketing spend more effectively.",

      "question": "What implications does Adobe's suite of marketing analytics tools have for Qualcomm's QCT segment financial incentives tied to marketing activities, particularly in light of QCT's $33.2 billion revenue scale and its reliance on customer incentive arrangements for marketing-related cost reimbursements?",
      "answer": "Adobe offers a comprehensive suite of marketing analytics tools\u2014such as Adobe Analytics, Customer Journey Analytics, and the Real-Time Customer Data Platform\u2014that enable businesses to optimize marketing activities and direct marketing spend more effectively. These tools provide real-time insights and cross-channel data integration, which can help companies better manage marketing campaigns and track ROI. Qualcomm\u2019s QCT segment, which generated $33.2 billion in fiscal 2024, includes marketing-related cost reimbursements as part of its customer incentive arrangements. These incentives are recognized as reductions to revenue and require accurate estimation and accounting due to variable consideration in contracts. Given the scale of QCT\u2019s revenue and the complexity in managing incentive accruals, Adobe\u2019s analytics capabilities could provide QCT\u2019s customers with the data infrastructure needed to track and justify marketing spend, thereby improving the transparency and accuracy of incentive calculations. This interplay suggests that Adobe\u2019s tools may indirectly support the financial operations of segments like QCT by enabling more precise and data-driven marketing execution.",

Meanwhile, INTC has made strategic investments in its European manufacturing footprint, including wafer fabrication facilities in Ireland and plans to expand capacity with government incentives and customer commitments. If ACN continues to face profitability issues in Europe, it may struggle to maintain investment levels or scale operations in the region, especially if large, complex contracts require coordination with third-party vendors or subcontractors.

          "chunk_text": "Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability. Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including taking actions to reduce certain costs and optimize our business. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to cost-effectively hire and retain people with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions, particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations, we may incur increased costs, which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability.\n\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable. Our contract profitability  is highly  dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client's satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nMoreover, many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy  these measures, it could significantly  reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms, any of which could significantly affect our profitability. We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients' actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved. Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nWe are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients' businesses. These deals may involve transforming a client's business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business. The scale and complexity of these projects present risks in execution and profitability challenges as a result of the costs we incur and investments we make at the beginning of these transactions. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the anticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or provide anticipated productivity gains, or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. A ny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\n\n## Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\n\nIn addition, our effectiv e tax  rate in the future could be adv ersely  affected by  challenges to our intercompany  transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Tax rates and policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change",

The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021:\n\n- North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.\n- Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs.\n- Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During fiscal 2022, Other income (expense) decreased $238 million from fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments.

Absent the $271 million investment gains and related $41 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 would have been 23.1%. The higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes. For",

We are committed to coengineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate mutual technology advancements and help software and hardware work better together.\n\n## Manufacturing at Scale\n\nWe manufacture a majority of our products in our own manufacturing facilities using our proprietary process technologies. This enables us to optimize performance, shorten time-to-market for new product introductions, and more quickly scale products in high volume.\n\nProcess technology. We continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology as we seek to realize the benefits from M oore's Law, a law of economics predicted by Intel's cofounder Gordon M oore more than 50 years ago. Realizing M oore's Law results in economic benefits as we are able to either reduce a chip's cost as we shrink its size or increase functionality and performance of a chip while maintaining the same cost with higher density. This makes possible the innovation of new products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size to meet customers' needs. A s of the end of 2024, our core products were manufactured on 300mm wafers, with a significant majority manufactured using our Intel 7 process node while we ramped our Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes into high volume.\n\nFactory network. Our global factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience. We operate wafer manufacturing facilities in the United States (Oregon and A rizona), Ireland, and Israel, assembly and testing facilities in Costa Rica, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and packaging facilities in the United States (New M exico), Costa Rica, V ietnam, and M alaysia. We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors and we plan to continue to build the majority of our products in our factories.\n\nFoundry services. The very high capital requirements of modern leading-edge semiconductor process technology development and manufacturing, especially those nodes requiring EUV lithography such as Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 18A  and future nodes, require us to expand the use of our process technologies as they mature and grow the number of wafers produced beyond the expected growth for our own products. To this end, we are seeking to build a world-class foundry business also serving external customers and have made significant investments in ecosystem support to enable the usage of our manufacturing network by external customers. Our foundry offerings include four components: wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplets, and software and services. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable products built with our advanced packaging technology. We plan to differentiate our foundry offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP.\n\n## Our People\n\nOur world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do. Together we strive to have a positive effect on business, society, and the planet. Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Our people build our technology, unlock new business opportunities, and work with our partners and customers to create global impact.\n\nFostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world's best engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet.\n\n## Focus on Innovation and Execution\n\nWe are focused on executing our product and process roadmaps and our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed process and packaging technology roadmap and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering competitive products in every area in which we compete.\n\nWe leverage our Smart Capital approach to help us adjust quickly to opportunities in the market while managing our margin structure and capital spending. The key elements of Smart Capital include:\n\n- Smart capacity investments. We are building out future manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online based on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and customer commitments.\n- Government incentives. We work with governments to advance and benefit from incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity for leading-edge semiconductors.\n- SCIP. We access strategically aligned private capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale manufacturing build-outs. Our SCIP program has supported the period of accelerated manufacturing investment that commenced in early 2021. We signed our latest SCIP agreement in the second quarter of 2024 and are not contemplating further transactions in the near term.\n- Customer commitments. Our foundry business works closely with potential customers to obtain advance payments to secure capacity and participate in manufacturing capacity build-outs. This provides us with the advantage of committed volume, derisking investments while providing capacity corridors for our foundry customers.\n- External foundries. We intend to continue our use of external foundries where their capabilities or capacities support our Intel Products businesses offerings.\n\nOur Strategy",

We also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. Any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of third-party providers we rely on, could result in service interruptions and harm our business. We have from time to time ex perienced service interruptions and such interruptions may occur in the future. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, particularly with respect to third-party cloud computing platforms, our exposure to damage from service interruptions or other performance or quality issues may increase. Service interruptions or other performance or quality issues may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.\n\nFor many of our offerings, our production environment and customers' data are replicated in a separate facility located elsewhere. Certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of destruction or vandalism or similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. In addition, supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical developments in Europe may lead to power disruptions in regions where our facilities are located. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or risks, or a natural disaster or public health emergency, an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems or operational failures at these facilities could result in lengthy service interruptions, and no assurance can be provided that any such interruptions would be remediated without significant cost or in a timely manner or at all.\n\nThe hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms that we rely on, including, for example, the large language models leveraged in our AI offerings, may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software, data or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and disrupt or otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services, and no assurance can be provided that such equivalent technology would be developed or obtained in a timely manner or at all.\n\nAs we scale our operations, the amount and type of information transferred on our offerings continues to evolve, including as a result of the deployment of AI technologies, and our infrastructure capacity requirements, including network capacity and computing power, may increase as a result. If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our reputation and business. As we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we move or transfer our data and our customers' data from time to time. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business.\n\nAs we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. We continue to evaluate such opportunities and expect to make such acquisitions in the future.\n\nAcquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including:\n\n- potential failure to achieve the ex pected benefits on a timely basis or at all;\n- potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings, as well as difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology;",

In contrast, Oracle's R&D expense increased by 1% from $6,640 million in FY2023 to $6,690 million in FY2024. Oracle attributed its smaller increase to higher employee-related expenses, including a 12% rise in stock-based compensation.

      "answer": "Oracle reported a 32% decline in Cloud Services and License Support revenue, dropping from $1,507 million in 2023 to $1,026 million in 2024, indicating a significant contraction in this segment. This decline suggests potential challenges in maintaining or growing revenue from cloud and licensing agreements. Meanwhile, AMD discloses that it reduces revenue for cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, and volume-based incentives, recognizing these reductions either at the time of revenue recognition or when the program is launched. AMD also notes that constraints related to variable consideration have not been material. This contrast highlights differing dynamics: Oracle's drop may reflect broader market or strategic challenges in cloud licensing, while AMD proactively accounts for variable consideration through structured revenue reductions, without significant constraints. The two companies thus demonstrate different approaches to revenue recognition within their respective business models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Revenue Reduction: AMD discloses that it reduces revenue for cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, and volume-based incentives, recognizing these reductions either at the time of revenue recognition or when the program is offered, with variable consideration constraints not being material.",

        "Hop 3: Cloud Services and License Support \u2190 ORCL: Oracle reports its Cloud Services and License Support agreements as a key revenue category, and the 32% drop suggests challenges in sustaining revenue from these offerings, which contrasts with AMD\u2019s structured recognition of revenue reductions tied to marketing programs."

Where funds prov ided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to rev enue at the time the related rev enue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to rev enue at the later of when: i) the related rev enue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer's cost to perform specific product adv ertising  or  marketing  and  promotional  activ ities,  such  amounts  are  recognized  as  a  reduction  to  rev enue  unless  they  qualify  for  expense recognition.\n\nConstraints of v ariable consideration hav e not been material.\n\n## Custom products\n\nCustom products, which are primarily associated with the Company's Gaming segment, are sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which hav e no alternativ e use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as rev enue, ov er the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of rev enue to recognize for in-process or completed customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believ es that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company's satisfaction of its performance obligation.\n\nSales of custom products are not subject to a right of return and arrangements generally inv olv e a single performance obligation. Generally, there are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products.\n\n## Development and intellectual property licensing agreements\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the prov ision of dev elopment serv ices and a license to the right  to  use  the  Company's  IP.  T hese  arrangements  are  deemed  to  be  single  or  multiple  performance  obligations  based  upon  the  nature  of  the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, ov er time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it is combined with the dev elopment serv ices as a single performance obligation and recognized ov er time. If the license is distinct, rev enue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely inv olv e the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company's patents or IP. Accordingly, rev enue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license.\n\nThere  are  no  v ariable  consideration  estimates  associated  with  either  combined  dev elopment  and  IP  arrangements  or  for  standalone  arrangements inv olv ing either the sale or licensing of IP.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable v alue using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserv es for its products, the  Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary  decreases  in  demand  for  its  products,  and  changes  in  technology  or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable v alue reserv es, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activ ity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. T he Company fully reserv es for inv entories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inv entory deemed obsolete. T he Company performs periodic rev iews of inv entory items to identify excess inv entories on hand by comparing onhand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activ ity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less fav orable than those projected by the Company, additional inv entory carrying v alue adjustments may be required.",

      "answer": "Adobe reports trademarks valued at $30 million, which are classified as identifiable intangible assets with a 5-year useful life. In contrast, Cisco depreciates tangible assets like furniture and fixtures over 5 years, indicating a physical asset lifecycle policy. While Adobe's trademarks are amortized over their useful life as intangible assets, Cisco's furniture and fixtures are depreciated as tangible property, plant, and equipment. This suggests Adobe focuses on managing finite-lived intangibles tied to branding, while Cisco maintains a structured depreciation approach for physical infrastructure assets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. Our private cloud infrastructure suite of solutions are available directly from Broadcom, resellers and distributors, hyperscale cloud providers, value-added OEMs and VMware cloud service provider partners. VMware Cloud Foundation ('VCF') provides license portability, which enables customers to purchase subscriptions of VCF software and move their VCF environments between on-premises data centers and supported cloud endpoints. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe, VMware, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stockbased compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, and i nventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence.\n\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\n\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.\n\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\n\nSelling , general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs, which include direct transaction costs and integration costs, and other corporate expenses.\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D'), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with our acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&amp;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nRestructuring and other charges. Restructuring and other charges consist primarily of non-recurring charges related to compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, IP litigation, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalization of product development program costs, facility and l ease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&amp;D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt i s s uance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.\n\nOther income (expense), net.

The increase was primarily due to contributions from VMware, partially offset by higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from the VMware Merger.\n\nAs a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was 63% and 69% of net revenue for the fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from the VMware Merger. In addition, gross margin contributions from our infrastructure software segment were partially offset by less favorable margin within the semiconductor solutions segment driven by product mix.\n\n## Research and Development Expense\n\nResearch and development expense increased $4,057 million, or 77%, in fiscal year 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation, including higher stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in headcount from the VMware Merger.

      "answer": "Oracle's R&D expenses increased by 1% in fiscal 2024 to $6,690 million, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses including a 12% rise in stock-based compensation. This reflects a strategic emphasis on talent and equity incentives. Broadcom, in contrast, also incurs significant R&D expenses focused on personnel costs and third-party engineering resources, indicating similar prioritization in innovation investment. However, Oracle's increase is more modest and specifically tied to internal workforce costs, whereas Broadcom's R&D approach is embedded in a broader cost structure that includes project materials and depreciation.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation.\n\nAllocation of consideration. We allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in a bundled arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.\n\nStandalone selling price. When available, we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance obligations. When directly observable transactions are not available, our estimates of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors, including, but not limited to, reasonably available data points such as costs incurred to provide the good or service, market conditions, entity-specific factors such as pricing strategies and objectives, and information about the customer.\n\nWe separately determine the standalone selling prices by product or service type. Additionally, we segment the standalone selling prices for products where the pricing strategies differ, and where there are differences in customers and circumstances that warrant segmentation.\n\nWe also estimate the standalone selling price of our material rights. We estimate the value of the customer's option to purchase or receive additional products or services at a discounted price by estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised.\n\n## Other Policies and Judgments\n\nContract modifications. We may modify contracts to offer customers additional products or services. Each of the additional products and services is generally considered distinct from those products or services transferred to the customer before the modification. We evaluate whether the contract price for the additional products and services reflects the standalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances applicable to that contract. In these cases, we account for the additional products or services as a separate contract. In other cases where the pricing in the modification does not reflect the standalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances applicable to that contract, we account for the additional products or services as part of the existing contract on a prospective basis, on a cumulative catch-up basis, or a combination of both based on the nature of the modification. In instances where the pricing in the modification offers the customer a credit for a prior arrangement, we adjust our variable consideration reserves for returns and other concessions.\n\nRight of return. Certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or a portion of the product or service and receive a credit. We estimate returns based on historical returns data which is constrained to an amount for which a material revenue reversal is not probable. We do not recognize revenue for products or services that are expected to be returned.\n\nPractical expedient elected. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. For contracts that were modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented, we have not retrospectively restated the contract for those modifications. We have disclosed the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations for purposes of determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price at transition.\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers and third parties engaged in the design and development of our products, software and technologies, including salary, bonus and stock-based compensation expense, project material costs, services and depreciation. Such costs are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.\n\nStock-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense for time-based restricted stock units ('RSUs') using the straight-line amortization method based on the fair value of RSUs on the date of grant. The fair value of RSUs is the closing market price of Broadcom common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on Broadcom common stock prior to vesting. We recognize compensation expense for time-based stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights under the Broadcom Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended ('ESPP') based on the estimated grant-date fair value determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model with a straight-line amortization method.\n\nCertain equity awards include both service and market conditions. The fair value of market-based awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Compensation expense for market-based awards is amortized based upon a graded vesting method over the service period.",

      "question": "How might a decline in QTL licensing revenues, which negatively impacted gross margin percentage for QCOM in 2022, affect AAPL's gross margin percentage in 2024, given AAPL's reliance on Qualcomm's patented technologies in its products?",
      "answer": "A decline in QTL licensing revenues negatively impacted QCOM's gross margin percentage in 2022 by reducing the proportion of high-margin licensing income relative to lower-margin QCT revenues. Since AAPL's products incorporate Qualcomm's patented technologies (e.g., 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), a sustained decline in QTL revenues could signal reduced licensing stability or potential shifts in Qualcomm's licensing model, which could affect the cost structure of components used in AAPL's devices. This, in turn, could influence AAPL's gross margin percentage in 2024 if component costs rise or if supply chain adjustments are required. The connection hinges on the interplay between QTL licensing trends and the cost of technology embedded in AAPL's products.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm's QTL licensing revenues increased due to a $402 million rise in estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products, despite a decrease in revenue per unit and the expiration of a Nokia upfront license fee.

While Apple does not directly pay QTL licensing fees, Qualcomm\u2019s improved licensing revenue trend in 2024 may reflect a stronger licensing environment or broader demand for high-margin mobile technologies, which could indirectly support a favorable gross margin environment for Apple through ecosystem-wide pricing or performance dynamics.",

      "answer": "Adobe's Publishing and Advertising Revenue decreased from $146 million in 2021 to $115 million in 2023, reflecting a consistent downward trend over two years. Similarly, Broadcom reported a $7 million loss from the sale of a business segment in fiscal 2022. Both figures indicate strategic shifts\u2014Adobe appears to be de-emphasizing its Publishing and Advertising segment, while Broadcom's $7 loss suggests a divestiture aligned with portfolio optimization. The parallel declines may signal a broader industry movement to reallocate resources away from certain legacy or non-core business lines.",

      "question": "How does the $2.29 billion revenue increase at ADBE driven by Creative and Document Cloud subscriptions compare to AVGO's reliance on subscription revenue as a key factor in its fluctuating operating results?",
      "answer": "ADBE experienced a $2.29 billion revenue increase in its Digital Media segment during fiscal 2021, primarily driven by growth in Creative and Document Cloud subscriptions. This reflects a strong shift toward subscription-based offerings and expanding customer adoption. Meanwhile, AVGO identifies subscription revenue as a key component of its revenue mix, and its fluctuation is cited as a major factor contributing to volatility in AVGO's operating results. Unlike ADBE\u2019s focused growth narrative around subscriptions, AVGO views subscription revenue timing and renewals as a risk that can materially affect quarterly performance, especially when combined with fixed operating expenses. This contrast highlights differing strategic and financial dependencies on subscription revenue between the two companies.",

These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals, as well as stockholder derivative suits; civil or criminal fines and penalties; legal and other expenses; and expenses associated with the remedial measure, if any, which may be imposed.\n\n## Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.\n\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this 'Risk Factors' section, these factors include, among others:\n\n- the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products are included and changes in enduser demand for our customers' the products;\n- fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers;\n- the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers;\n- the timing of new software contracts and renewals, as well as the timing of any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund to customers any pre-paid amounts under the contract;\n- our ability to timely develop, introduce and market new products and technologies;\n- the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue;\n- new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;\n- seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets;\n- timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures, and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies; and\n- timing of any regulatory changes, particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, and tax reform.\n\nThe foregoing factors are often difficult to predict, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result, we believe that quarterto-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time.\n\n## Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements, which may not be accurate.",

Since unearned revenue is connected to income tax payable\u2014as seen in NVDA\u2019s disclosures where unearned revenue is listed as part of tax-related liabilities\u2014AVGO may experience a similar pattern where deferred revenue recognition affects its tax obligations. NVDA's current income tax payable of $1,361 million (as of January 28, 2024) reflects existing deferred tax liabilities, some of which are tied to unearned revenue.

      "answer": "Broadcom's expected term for stock options decreased from 4.8 years in fiscal 2023 to 3.6 years in fiscal 2024. Since companies typically match the term of equity awards with corresponding Treasury bill rates, this pattern suggests shorter-duration Treasuries are being used. NVIDIA explicitly states they select risk-free interest rates based on observed Treasury bill rates appropriate for the expected term of equity awards. Therefore, if NVIDIA observes similar patterns in industry peers like Broadcom, they may also shift toward using shorter-term Treasury rates when valuing their own equity incentives.",

      "question": "How does Intel's recent focus on graphics innovation in its Core Ultra processors compare to NVIDIA's financial exposure in its Graphics segment, particularly when considering unallocated acquisition-related amortization costs?",
      "answer": "Intel has emphasized graphics improvements in its Intel Core Ultra 200V and 200S Series processors, positioning them as key components for AI PCs and high-performance computing. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's Graphics segment reported $372 million in depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal 2025, which does not include acquisition-related intangible amortization costs. These acquisition-related costs are instead grouped under 'All Other,' indicating that NVIDIA's Graphics segment financials may understate its true long-term cost structure tied to acquisitions. This suggests NVIDIA may face hidden financial pressures from past deals that aren't reflected in its Graphics segment reporting, unlike Intel\u2019s more transparent treatment of graphics-related R&D and product costs.",

By doing this, we believe we help fuel innovation across the industry, providing a solid source of IP, scale, and cash flow for Intel.\n\n## Market Trends and Strategy\n\nIn 2024, the PC market started to stabilize from a soft macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures, with PC supply and demand levels beginning to normalize. We remain positive on the long-term outlook for PCs, as household density is stable to increasing, educational device penetration rates remain low outside of the US, and PC usage remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic rates . Commercial growth opportunities also remain as corporations expand the size of their PC fleets, while also replacing older devices. Currently, more than 200 million commercial devices are more than four years old . 1 2\n\nWe recently introduced our Intel Core Ultra processor family that serves as the CPU for the A I PC, which enables A I capabilities at the client level. We believe the A I PC is a significant potential driver of PC demand over the coming years, and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend that we expect will support a long-term PC TAM  of 300 million units . 3\n\nWe deliver value to our customers by leveraging our engineering capabilities and working with our partners across an open, innovative ecosystem to deliver technology that drives every major aspect of the computing experience, including performance, power efficiency, battery life, connectivity, graphics, and form factors, to create the most advanced PC platforms. We design our products with a philosophy of openness and choice, and seek to continually provide more competitive products with more capabilities for customers.\n\n## Products and Competition\n\nIn 2023, we introduced a significant update to our client compute brands to make it easier for customers to identify the right client solutions for their compute needs. Those brands include Intel, Intel Core and Intel Core Ultra. The Intel and Intel Core brands have been staples of the PC industry for nearly two decades and represented our highest volume products by unit sales in 2024. These products are designed to serve a broad cross-section of the customer and computing needs in the client market.\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra processor family, which we launched at the end of 2023, delivers significant advancements in graphics, A I, and multi-threaded CPU performance and introduced the AI PC to the market. In the second half of 2024, the next-generation Intel Core Ultra 200V  Series became our highest performance client processors, with increased battery life for mobile PCs. We also introduced the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series processors, catering to the desktop enthusiast market. We remain committed to delivering the most advanced processing power to support the growing demands of AI, graphics, and multithreaded workloads.\n\nWe operate in a particularly competitive market. In processors, we compete with A dvanced M icro Devices, Inc. (A M D) and vendors who design applications processors based on ARM architecture, such as Apple Inc. (A pple) with its M  series products and Qualcomm Inc. (Qualcomm) with its Snapdragon product. We expect this competitive environment to continue to intensify in 2025.\n\nWe remain committed to creating an open ecosystem to foster growth and technology innovations. We embrace and collaborate with a global ecosystem of industry partners to deliver competitive technologies together.\n\n- Source: Intel calculated PC density from industry analyst reports. 1\n- Source: Intel calculated volume of devices over four years old from industry analyst reports and internal data. 2\n- Source: Intel calculated multi-year TAM forecast derived from industry analyst reports. 3\n\nMD&amp;A",

      "answer": "AVGO's $23.6 billion in remaining performance obligations indicates a significant amount of future revenue that will be recognized over time, a portion of which contributes to unearned revenue. Since unearned revenue is linked to income tax payable\u2014as evidenced by NVDA's disclosure that unearned revenue from hardware support, software support, and cloud services is included in tax calculations\u2014AVGO's large backlog implies potential future tax liabilities. This contrasts with NVDA's $980 million income tax payable in 2022, which already reflects their current tax obligations, including those arising from unearned revenue. Therefore, AVGO may face larger or more prolonged tax liabilities in the future as it recognizes revenue from its performance obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. The majority of our customer software contracts include termination for convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are not considered committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usagebased royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions segment contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of October 30, 2022 were approximately $23.6 billion. We expect approximately 28% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Although the majority of our software contracts are not deemed to be committed, our customers generally do not exercise their termination for convenience rights. In addition, the majority of our contracts for products, subscriptions and services have a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods.\n\n## 4. Acquisitions\n\n## Pending Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 'VMware Merger Agreement') to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger') that values VMware at approximately $61 billion based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash.\n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger.\n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware RSU awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.\n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors.\n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion.\n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $1.5 billion.",

In contrast, Broadcom reports $70 million in IPR&D assets but does not assign a defined amortization period to them, indicating that these assets remain unamortized until either commercialization or impairment.

We fulfill this  promise  by  providing  access  to  a  solution  that  integrates  cloud-based  and  on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/ondevice software or cloud services on their own.\n\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to:  Creative  Cloud  Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of digital assets across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe's cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.\n\nStandalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable inputs, primarily actual historical selling prices for performance obligations where available, and includes consideration of factors such as go-to-market model and geography. Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling  price  depending  on  factors  such  as  where  they  are  sold  and  what  channel  they  are  sold  through.  Where  standalone  selling  price  may  not  be  directly observable (e.g., the performance obligation is not sold separately), we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.\n\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5 years.  We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, including contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products. When the expected period of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we expense the amount as incurred, utilizing the practical ex pedient. We regularly evaluate whether there have been changes in the underlying assumptions and data used to determine the amortization period.\n\nWhen revenue arrangements include components of third-party goods and services, for example in transactions which involve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer by evaluating indicators such as which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, which party has discretion in establishing price and the underlying terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction.\n\nWe offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers and/or enduser customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as variable consideration when estimating transaction price. Returns, rebates and other offsets to transaction price are estimated at contract inception on a portfolio basis and assessed for reasonableness each reporting period when additional information becomes available.\n\n## General Contract Provisions\n\nWe maintain revenue reserves for rebates, rights of return and other limited price adjustments. Distributors are allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and for products that are being replaced by new versions. We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. Transaction price is reduced for these amounts based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period, such as volume and timely reporting.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. The primary method of establishing these reserves is to review historical data from prior periods as a percent of revenue to determine a historical reserve rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future returns. When necessary, we also provide a specific reserve in excess of portfolio-level estimated requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans and other factors.",

          "chunk_text": "\nCustomer contracts and related relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from sales of SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications. Customer contracts and related relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the customer contracts and related relationships less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The economic useful life was determined based on the useful lives of other intangible assets and the length of time remaining on the acquired contracts.\n\nDeveloped technology relates to SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications. We valued the developed technology using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the developed technology. The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash flows over the forecast period.\n\nThe fair value of IPR&amp;D was determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue from the IPR&amp;D.\n\n## 5. Supplemental Financial Information\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents included $1,716 million and $1,470 million of time deposits and $1,171 million and $1,650 million of money-market funds as of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. For time deposits, carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of money-market funds, which was consistent with their carrying value, was determined using unadjusted prices in active, accessible markets for i dentical assets, and as such, they were classified as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Accounts Receivable Factoring\n\nWe sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring arrangements. We account for these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring arrangements were $5,900 million, $3,975 million and $3,700 million during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in other income (expense), net and were not material for any of the periods presented.\n\n## Inventory\n\n",

In contrast, Broadcom reports $2,340 million in IPR&D assets as of 2024, which are not amortized (as indicated by the 'N/A' amortization period in prior reporting), suggesting a key difference in how the two companies manage long-term intangible assets tied to future revenue potential.",

We fulfill this  promise  by  providing  access  to  a  solution  that  integrates  cloud-based  and  on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/ondevice software or cloud services on their own.\n\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to:  Creative  Cloud  Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of digital assets across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe's cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.\n\nStandalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable inputs, primarily actual historical selling prices for performance obligations where available, and includes consideration of factors such as go-to-market model and geography. Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling  price  depending  on  factors  such  as  where  they  are  sold  and  what  channel  they  are  sold  through.  Where  standalone  selling  price  may  not  be  directly observable (e.g., the performance obligation is not sold separately), we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.\n\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5 years.  We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, including contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products. When the expected period of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we expense the amount as incurred, utilizing the practical ex pedient. We regularly evaluate whether there have been changes in the underlying assumptions and data used to determine the amortization period.\n\nWhen revenue arrangements include components of third-party goods and services, for example in transactions which involve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer by evaluating indicators such as which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or services, which party has discretion in establishing price and the underlying terms and conditions between the parties to the transaction.\n\nWe offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers and/or enduser customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as variable consideration when estimating transaction price. Returns, rebates and other offsets to transaction price are estimated at contract inception on a portfolio basis and assessed for reasonableness each reporting period when additional information becomes available.\n\n## General Contract Provisions\n\nWe maintain revenue reserves for rebates, rights of return and other limited price adjustments. Distributors are allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and for products that are being replaced by new versions. We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. Transaction price is reduced for these amounts based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period, such as volume and timely reporting.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. The primary method of establishing these reserves is to review historical data from prior periods as a percent of revenue to determine a historical reserve rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future returns. When necessary, we also provide a specific reserve in excess of portfolio-level estimated requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans and other factors.",

Meanwhile, Adobe's sales and marketing expenses rose to $4,321 million in 2022 from $3,591 million in 2021, a $730 million (20.3%) increase.

      "answer": "Microsoft experienced an 8% increase in sales and marketing expenses, partly offset by a 2% favorable foreign currency impact, reflecting strategic investments in areas like commercial sales and LinkedIn. In contrast, Adobe's sales and marketing expenses include amortization of contract acquisition costs, such as sales commissions, which represent long-term investments in customer acquisition and retention. This highlights differing cost structures: Microsoft's growth is driven by expansion in sales teams and platforms, while Adobe's expenses are influenced by recurring amortization costs tied to customer contracts. The foreign currency impact helped moderate Microsoft's expense growth, whereas Adobe's structure suggests more fixed long-term costs.",

In contrast, NVDA's gross profit as a percentage of revenue in 2022 was 65.0% (calculated as $17,475 gross profit divided by $26,914 revenue).

      "answer": "Apple reported a flat gross margin percentage in 2022, while Qualcomm noted that its gross margin percentage also remained flat, despite an decrease in the proportion of high-margin QTL licensing revenues relative to QCT revenues. This suggests that while Qualcomm experienced downward pressure on margins due to the reduced contribution from QTL licensing, which typically carries higher margins, this was offset by improvements in QCT's gross margin. If Qualcomm's licensing revenue mix negatively impacted its margins, it's possible that Apple, as a major customer, may have benefited from more favorable component pricing or terms, potentially supporting Apple's stable gross margin percentage.",

      "question": "What does Adobe's 4% increase in compensation costs suggest about their talent investment strategy relative to Cisco's $3.074 billion total share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2024?",
      "answer": "Adobe's 4% increase in compensation costs, driven by the need to retain and recruit senior management and highly skilled personnel amid intense competition for AI and cybersecurity talent, indicates a strategic focus on talent acquisition and retention. This percentage increase connects directly to Adobe's broader compensation strategy, which contributes to their overall operating expenses. In comparison, Cisco disclosed a significantly larger dollar amount\u2014$3.074 billion\u2014in total share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2024, suggesting a more aggressive or scaled financial commitment to employee compensation. While Adobe is managing cost increases through global hiring strategies and efficiency gains, Cisco's substantial investment reflects a different approach, potentially signaling a greater emphasis on equity-based incentives as a core component of their talent strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nevaluation  process  may  be  longer  and  more  involved,  and  require  us  to  invest  more  in  educating  our  customers  about  our  products,  services  and  solutions, particularly because the decision to use our products, services and solutions is often an enterprise-wide decision. We are increasingly offering end-to-end solutions that include cross-cloud and generative AI capabilities, which have in the past, and may in the future, increase the complexity of technical or contractual assurances or requirements that we or our customers require as part of the contracting process, leading to extended sales cycles. We may be required to submit more robust proposals, participate in ex tended proof-of-concept evaluation cycles and engage in more extensive contract negotiations. In addition, our enterprise customers often demand more complex configurations and additional integration services and product features. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have caused, and may continue to cause, additional spend scrutiny and delays in our enterprise customers' purchasing decisions. Due to these factors, we often must devote greater sales support to certain enterprise customers, which increases our costs and time required to complete a sale, without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. We also may be required to devote more services resources to implementation, which increases our costs, without assurance that customers receiving these services will renew or renew at the same level. Since the sales cycles for our enterprise offerings are multi-phased and complex, it is often unpredictable when a given sales cycle will close. Our revenue from enterprise customers may be affected by longer-than-expected sales, contract negotiation and implementation cycles, extended collection cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing arrangements. Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been, and is expected to remain, uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarter's total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry.\n\n## If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed, and our hybrid work model may present challenges, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management and highly skilled personnel across all levels  of  our  organization.  Our  senior  management  has  acquired  specialized  knowledge  and  skills  with  respect  to  our  business,  and  the  loss  of  any  of  these individuals could harm our business, especially if we are not successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our efforts to attract, develop, integrate and retain highly skilled employees may be compounded by intensified restrictions on immigration or the availability of work visas. The technology industry has been and may continue to be subject to substantial and continuous competition for talent, particularly with AI and cybersecurity backgrounds, and demand for cutting-edge or unique skill sets may continue to be highly competitive, both of which are heightened with hybrid or remote working arrangements. Our hybrid work environment may also present operational, security and workplace culture challenges, which could negatively affect our ability to execute against our business objectives and retain and recruit personnel. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, higher compensation costs to retain and recruit senior management or highly skilled personnel that may not be offset by innovation, improved productivity or increased sales. We continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower costs, which increases the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel-related expenditures. Nonetheless, as globalization continues, competition for talent in those countries has increased, which may impact our ability to retain these employees and increase our compensation-related expenses.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws and Regulations\n\n## We are, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, regulatory inquiries and other claims, which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\n\nWe are, and may in the future become, subject to various legal proceedings (including class action lawsuits), claims, negotiations and regulatory inquiries and additional claims, enforcement actions and inquiries may arise in the future, such as those relating to antitrust, data privacy and security, consumer protection, product liability and the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, among others. Such activity has increased over time with evolving regulatory landscapes and as our products, services and solutions have become more available to, and used by, more enterprises and consumers. For example, there is an increase in enforcement activity in connection with federal and state consumer protection laws, including some suits which seek civil penalties. Any proceedings, actions, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be highly time consuming; result in costly litigation,  damage  awards,  consent  decrees,  injunctive  relief  or  increased  costs  of  business;  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  or  products;  result  in negative publicity; require significant amounts of management time; result in the diversion of significant operational resources; or otherwise harm our business and financial results.\n\nDisputes and litigation can be complex and are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention of management and key personnel. For example, third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from offering certain products, services or solutions, subject us to injunctions restricting our sales, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy",

During the year, we made sev eral key optimizations and additional features in the latest AMD  ROCm software that increases performance in key generativ e AI workloads, adds expanded support and optimization for additional frameworks and libraries, and simplifies the ov erall dev eloper experience.\n\n## Our Business\n\nOur four reportable segments are:\n\n- the Data Center segment, which primarily includes AI accelerators, serv er CPUs, GPUs, APUs, DPUs, FPGAs, SmartNICs, and Adaptiv e SoC products for data centers;\n- the Client segment, which primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks;\n- the Gaming segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and dev elopment serv ices; and\n- the Embedded segment, which primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, SOMs, and Adaptive SoC products.\n\nIn addition to these reportable segments, we hav e an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment.\n\nBeginning with our fiscal year ending December 27, 2025, we plan to combine the Client and Gaming segments into one reportable segment to align with how we manage our business. As a result, we will hav e three reportable segments: Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded.\n\n## Data Center Segment\n\n## Data Center Market\n\nThe Data Center segment primarily includes serv er-class CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs, SmartNICs, and Adaptiv e SoC products. We lev erage our technology to address the computational, v isual data processing and AI workload acceleration needs in the data center market. Modern data centers require high performance, energy efficient, scalable and adaptable compute engines to meet the demand driv en by the growing amount of data that needs to be stored, accessed, analyzed and managed. Different combinations of  CPUs,  GPUs,  DPUs,  FPGAs,  SmartNICs, and Adaptiv e SoCs enable the optimization of performance and power for a div erse set of workloads.\n\n## Data Center Products\n\nServer  CPUs. Our  CPUs  for  serv er  platforms  currently  include  the  AMD  EPYC  Series  processors.  EPYC  CPUs,  which  are  based  on  the  x86 architecture,  are  serv er-specific  processors  designed  for  high-performance  computing,  enterprise  IT ,  supercomputing,  and  large  data  centers.  We recently announced our 5th generation AMD EPYC family of serv er processors, further expanding our high-performance serv er CPU portfolio.\n\nData Center GPUs. Our AMD Instinct family of GPU accelerator products, including AMD Instinct MI200, MI300 and MI325 series, are based on AMD CDNA\u2122 architecture. AMD  Instinct  accelerators  are  designed  to  address  the  growing  demand  for  AI  training  and  inferencing  and  exascale-class scientific computing. Our v isual cloud GPU offerings include products in the Radeon\u2122 PRO V families. Our v isual cloud data center GPUs include a range of solutions tailored towards workloads requiring remote v isualization, such as Desktop-as-a-Serv ice, Workstation-as-a-Serv ice and Cloud Gaming.",

For certain QCT customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether the Company has the intent and contractual right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition of QCT customer incentive arrangements is a critical audit matter are the significant audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the completeness and accuracy of reductions to QCT revenues recognized.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's review of and accounting for QCT customer incentive arrangements as well as controls relating to management's review over the completeness and accuracy of reductions to revenues in fiscal 2022 and accruals for customer incentive arrangements as of the balance sheet date. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of reductions to revenues and accruals for QCT customer incentive arrangements recorded in the consolidated financial statements, and recalculating, on a test basis, reductions to revenues and accruals for QCT customer incentive arrangements based upon customer-specific contractual terms.\n\n## /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nSan Diego, California November 2, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1985.",

For 2021, the results of our Intel Optane memory business are included in our DCG operating segment, and our NSG segment is comprised of our NAND memory business to align to the pending divestiture of our NAND memory business. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\nWe have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.\n\nWe have an \"all other\" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:\n\n- results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented;\n- historical results of operations from divested businesses;\n- results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business;\n- amounts included within restructuring and other charges;\n- a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and\n- acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.\n\nThe CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n83",

Similarly, NVIDIA reports IP-related costs as part of its 'All Other' category, which includes enterprise-level expenses not directly tied to core segments like Graphics or Compute & Networking. These IP-related costs, while recurring and less specified in exact dollar amounts in 2022, represent strategic legal and intellectual property investments that influence NVIDIA\u2019s broader corporate financial strategy.

Intel's 'All Other' category for the same period included acquisition-related costs, such as amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill, along with unallocated corporate expenses. Both companies used the 'All Other' segment to capture enterprise-level costs not directly tied to operating segments, but NVIDIA specifically highlighted IP-related costs as a distinct component, whereas Intel focused more on restructuring, startup businesses, and divestiture-related impacts.",

IOTG, Mobileye, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. Our Internet of Things portfolio, presented as Internet of Things, is comprised of the IOTG and Mobileye operating segments. For 2021, the results of our Intel Optane memory business are included in our DCG operating segment, and our NSG segment is comprised of our NAND memory business to align to the pending divestiture of our NAND memory business. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\nWe have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.\n\nWe have an \"all other\" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:\n\n- results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented;\n- historical results of operations from divested businesses;\n- results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business;\n- amounts included within restructuring and other charges;\n- a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and\n- acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.\n\nThe CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n83",

      "answer": "Broadcom's semiconductor solutions segment reported an operating income of $16,486 million in fiscal year 2023, on total semiconductor net revenue of $28,182 million, yielding an operating margin of approximately 58.5%. In contrast, Intel's Client Computing segment, which includes Desktop and Notebook revenue of $10,166 million and $16,990 million respectively in 2023, reported an operating income of $6,520 million on total Client Computing revenue of $29,258 million, yielding an operating margin of about 22.3%. This shows that Broadcom\u2019s semiconductor business maintained a significantly higher operating margin compared to Intel\u2019s Client Computing segment in the same year.",

      "question": "How does the decline in AVGO's total operating income from $16,207 million to $13,463 million between fiscal years 2023 and 2024 compare with the operating performance of Intel Foundry Services, which reported a loss of $482 million in 2023, and what implications might this have for their respective strategic positioning in the semiconductor ecosystem?",
      "answer": "AVGO experienced a 17% decline in total operating income from $16,207 million in fiscal year 2023 to $13,463 million in fiscal year 2024, driven by a significant increase in unallocated expenses. Meanwhile, Intel Foundry Services (IFS), a key segment within INTC, reported an operating loss of $482 million in 2023, reflecting ongoing challenges in scaling its foundry business. Both companies are navigating complex semiconductor market dynamics\u2014AVGO through internal cost pressures and INTC through external competitive and operational challenges in its IFS segment. This suggests that while AVGO is managing through a period of strategic cost reallocation, INTC faces deeper structural challenges in its foundry ambitions, which could affect their respective leverage and positioning in the broader semiconductor ecosystem.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 Total Operating Income: AVGO's total operating income declined from $16,207 million in FY2023 to $13,463 million in FY2024, a 17% drop, primarily due to a $11,355 million increase in unallocated expenses.",
        "Hop 2: Total Operating Income \u2192 Intel Foundry Services: Intel Foundry Services (IFS), a segment of INTC, reported an operating loss of $482 million in 2023, showing continued financial strain despite modest revenue growth to $952 million.",
        "Hop 3: Intel Foundry Services \u2190 INTC: Intel Foundry Services is a strategic but underperforming segment of INTC, indicating broader challenges in its foundry business that contrast with AVGO\u2019s internal cost and income dynamics."

      "answer": "AVGO's Total Operating Income declined from $16,207 million in 2023 to $13,463 million in 2024, a decrease of $2,744 million or 16.9%. Over the same period, INTC's Network and Edge segment experienced an operating loss of $482 million in 2024 compared to a profit of $1,033 million in 2023, representing a year-over-year swing of $1,515 million. This synchronized downturn suggests sector-wide challenges affecting profitability in semiconductor and infrastructure-related businesses, including potential demand softness, supply chain disruptions, or increased R&D and manufacturing costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 Total Operating Income: AVGO's Total Operating Income fell from $16,207 million in 2023 to $13,463 million in 2024, indicating a decline in profitability.",
        "Hop 2: Total Operating Income \u2192 Network and Edge: INTC's Network and Edge segment, a key part of its semiconductor and infrastructure business, moved from a profit of $1,033 million in 2023 to a loss of $482 million in 2024, showing a significant deterioration.",
        "Hop 3: Network and Edge \u2190 INTC: The Network and Edge segment is a core operating unit for INTC, and its performance reflects broader challenges in the same sector where AVGO also reports declining operating income."

Meanwhile, Intel's total operating income fell dramatically from $2,334 million in 2022 to just $93 million in 2023. A significant contributor to this erosion was Intel Foundry Services, whose operating loss increased by 71% year-over-year\u2014from $281 million in 2022 to $482 million in 2023\u2014exacerbating Intel's overall profitability challenges.

The increase in gross margin was due to a fav orable shift in rev enue mix of higher Data Center and Client rev enues, lower Gaming rev enue, partially offset by the impact of lower Embedded rev enue.\n\n## Expenses\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses of $6.5 billion in 2024 increased by $584 million, or 10%, compared to $5.9 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount in support of our AI strategy.\n\n## Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrativ e expenses of $2.8 billion in 2024 increased by $431 million, or 18%, compared to $2.4 billion in 2023. T he increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activ ities to support our rev enue growth.\n\n## Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.4 billion for 2024 decreased by $417 million, or 15%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2023. T he decrease was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles being fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.\n\n## Restructuring Charges\n\nWe recognized $186 million of restructuring charges in 2024 due to the implementation of a restructuring plan (the 2024 Restructuring Plan). The 2024 Restructuring Plan was focused on driv ing efficiencies across the business and aligning resources with our largest growth opportunities in the AI and enterprise markets.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nWe hold equity interests in two joint v entures (collectiv ely, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information T echnology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. We recognized $48 million and $34 million of licensing gain from royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, in 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely.",

      "question": "How do AMD's contract termination costs, as part of its acquisition-related expenses totaling $258 million in 2023, compare in strategic context and recognition policy to CRM's contract termination costs recognized during restructuring, particularly in terms of timing and operational triggers?",
      "answer": "AMD's contract termination costs are embedded within its broader acquisition-related and other costs of $258 million in 2023, reflecting expenses tied to its acquisition strategy, such as the full-year integration of Xilinx. These costs are recognized as part of AMD's post-acquisition restructuring and operational alignment. In contrast, CRM recognizes contract termination costs during restructuring at the earlier of the contract termination or cease-use dates, indicating a more immediate operational trigger tied to facility exits and cost containment. While AMD's costs reflect strategic integration following acquisitions, CRM's approach emphasizes real-time cost recognition in response to operational decisions, such as exiting leased spaces. This distinction highlights AMD's longer-term integration focus versus CRM's reactive restructuring approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Acquisition-Related and Other Costs: AMD reported $258 million in acquisition-related and other costs in 2023, which included contract termination costs associated with integrating Xilinx.",
        "Hop 2: Acquisition-Related and Other Costs \u2192 Contract Termination Costs: AMD's acquisition-related costs specifically include contract termination expenses, indicating strategic restructuring following acquisitions.",
        "Hop 3: Contract Termination Costs \u2190 CRM: CRM recognizes contract termination costs at the earlier of contract termination or cease-use dates, typically during restructuring such as exiting leased facilities."

      "question": "How does the treatment of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles in AMD's 'All Other' category compare to CRM's inclusion of this metric in marketing and sales expenses, particularly in relation to their respective segment performance evaluations?",
      "answer": "AMD reports amortization of acquisition-related intangibles as part of its 'All Other' category, which is not allocated to any of its reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses in evaluating segment performance. This category also includes other non-operational expenses such as employee stock-based compensation and restructuring charges.

This suggests that CRM integrates acquisition-related amortization into its go-to-market strategy evaluation, while AMD isolates it from segment-level performance analysis, reflecting differing approaches to evaluating the financial impact of acquisitions.",

      "answer": "CSCO's 2.0 percentage point increase in annual gross margin percentage suggests improved cost management or product mix, which could provide some buffer against margin compression from potential licensing revenue declines. However, unlike QCOM which experienced margin pressure in 2022 when higher-margin QTL licensing revenues decreased as a proportion of QCT revenues, CSCO would need to maintain its operational improvements while managing any shift away from high-margin revenue streams. The 2024 QCOM licensing revenue increase of $402 million from 3G/4G/5G multimode product sales highlights the importance of maintaining high-margin revenue sources alongside gross margin optimization.",

      "question": "How does the 64.7% gross margin percentage reported by CSCO in fiscal 2024 relate to the decline in QTL licensing revenues as a proportion of QCT revenues observed by QCOM in fiscal 2022, given QTL's reliance on per-unit royalties from multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices?",
      "answer": "CSCO's 64.7% gross margin percentage in fiscal 2024 reflects stable cost of goods sold relative to revenue, which contrasts with QCOM's 2022 gross margin trend that was negatively impacted by a decline in the proportion of high-margin QTL licensing revenues. This decline in QTL's contribution to overall revenue was due to a shift in QCT's (Qualcomm\u2019s chip business) revenue mix toward lower-margin product sales. QTL's licensing model, which depends heavily on per-unit royalties from multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices like smartphones, makes it vulnerable to market shifts that favor hardware over licensing, thereby indirectly affecting overall gross margin percentages across Qualcomm\u2019s segments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CSCO \u2192 Gross Margin Percentage: CSCO reports a 64.7% gross margin percentage for fiscal 2024, indicating strong gross profitability relative to cost of goods sold.",
        "Hop 2: Gross Margin Percentage \u2192 QTL Licensing Revenues: QCOM notes in 2022 that gross margin percentage remained flat due to a decrease in the proportion of high-margin QTL licensing revenues relative to QCT product revenues.",
        "Hop 3: QTL Licensing Revenues \u2190 QCOM: QTL licensing revenues are primarily derived from per-unit royalties on multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices, such as smartphones, and are a significant contributor to Qualcomm\u2019s profitability."

Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Such governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings could require us to change our patent licensing practices, as described herein in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. '\n\nQSI Segment. QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including but not limited to 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business and our cloud computing processing initiative. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 'Our Business and Operating Segments' section under the heading 'Seasonality.'\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax , contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.

          "chunk_text": "## Government Incentives\n\nWe enter into government incentive arrangements with local, regional, and national governments, both US and non-US. These arrangements vary in size, duration, and conditions and allow us to maintain a market-comparable foothold across various geographies. These incentives are primarily structured as cash grants and refundable tax credits. Capital-related incentives have terms of up to 15 years and operating-related incentives have terms that can vary widely. We are eligible to receiv e these incentiv es because we engage in qualifying capital investments, R&amp;D, and other activities as defined by the relevant government entities. These include qualifying capital investments for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging manufacturing facilities construction and acquisition of equipment. Each incentive requires that we comply with certain conditions for a period that may exceed the incentive terms. These conditions can include achievement of future operational targets and committing to minimum levels of capital investment. If conditions are not satisfied, the incentives may be subject to reduction, recapture, or termination. For example, in November 2024 we entered into a direct funding agreement with the US Department of Commerce under the CHIPS Act that contains detailed milestones we must achieve for us to receive the funds, including the achievement of various milestones with respect to capital expenditures, facility completion, process technology development, wafer production, Intel products insourcing, and external foundry customer acquisitions. It also contains restrictions on certain 'change of control' transactions we are permitted to engage in, a requirement that we share with the US government project economic returns above specified thresholds, and various termination rights and remedies if we were to breach the agreement, including potential repayment of some or all of the awards.\n\nCapital-related incentives reduced gross property, plant, and equipment by $9.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($5.5 billion as of December 30, 2023), of which $4.1 billion was recognized in 2024 ($2.2 billion in 2023). Capital-related incentives reduced depreciation expense by $594 million in 2024, of which the substantial majority reduced cost of sale s ($226 million in 2023, substantially all of which reduced cost of sales, and $230 million in 2022, all of which reduced cost of sales) . Of our total capital-related gov ernment incentives recognized in 2024, $3.3 billion was recognized as a non-cash investing activity ($1.1 billion in 2023 and $128 million in 2022). Related incentives recognized during each period consisted of the following:\n\n- US federal government pursuant to the CHIPS Act. In September 2024, we were awarded up to $3.0 billion in direct funding for the Secure Enclave program to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. In November 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the US Department of Commerce for the award of $7.9 billion in government incentives. We recognized $1.3 billion of grants, including $253 million of operating grants, in 2024 under the CHIPS A ct. A dditionally, we recognized an advanced manufacturing investment tax credit of $2.6 billion in 2024 ($845 million in 2023), which may be refunded to us in cash to the extent it exceeds our outstanding income tax liabilities.\n- US state governments. We recognized $115 million of grants in 2024 related to modernization and expansion of chip factories in Oregon ($723 million in 2023 related to two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio).\n- Non-US governments. We recognized $384 million of grants and refundable tax credits in 2024 ($645 million in 2023), substantially all and a majority of which, respectively, related to the expansion of silicon wafer manufacturing facilities in Ireland.\n\nOperating-related incentives, including those recognized under the CHIPS A ct, benefited operating income by $442 million in 2024, the substantial majority of which was recorded in cost of sales ($202 million in 2023 and $104 million in 2022, a majority of which was recorded in cost of sales in both periods).\n\nT he amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to grants receivable and capital-related refundable tax credits for each period were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Intel received $3.0 billion under the CHIPS Act for the Secure Enclave program as part of its 'Other Activities' segment, which includes capital-related government incentives aimed at expanding trusted semiconductor manufacturing. This funding is tied to specific compliance milestones and operational commitments. In contrast, Qualcomm\u2019s QCT segment recorded $33.2 billion in revenues in fiscal 2024, which were reduced by customer incentive arrangements such as rebates and marketing reimbursements. These incentives require complex revenue recognition accounting and are treated as variable consideration based on contractual terms.

These arrangements vary in size, duration, and conditions and allow us to maintain a market-comparable foothold across various geographies. These incentives are primarily structured as cash grants and refundable tax credits. Capital-related incentives have terms of up to 15 years and operating-related incentives have terms that can vary widely. We are eligible to receiv e these incentiv es because we engage in qualifying capital investments, R&amp;D, and other activities as defined by the relevant government entities. These include qualifying capital investments for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging manufacturing facilities construction and acquisition of equipment. Each incentive requires that we comply with certain conditions for a period that may exceed the incentive terms. These conditions can include achievement of future operational targets and committing to minimum levels of capital investment. If conditions are not satisfied, the incentives may be subject to reduction, recapture, or termination. For example, in November 2024 we entered into a direct funding agreement with the US Department of Commerce under the CHIPS Act that contains detailed milestones we must achieve for us to receive the funds, including the achievement of various milestones with respect to capital expenditures, facility completion, process technology development, wafer production, Intel products insourcing, and external foundry customer acquisitions. It also contains restrictions on certain 'change of control' transactions we are permitted to engage in, a requirement that we share with the US government project economic returns above specified thresholds, and various termination rights and remedies if we were to breach the agreement, including potential repayment of some or all of the awards.\n\nCapital-related incentives reduced gross property, plant, and equipment by $9.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($5.5 billion as of December 30, 2023), of which $4.1 billion was recognized in 2024 ($2.2 billion in 2023).

In September 2024, we were awarded up to $3.0 billion in direct funding for the Secure Enclave program to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. In November 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the US Department of Commerce for the award of $7.9 billion in government incentives. We recognized $1.3 billion of grants, including $253 million of operating grants, in 2024 under the CHIPS A ct. A dditionally, we recognized an advanced manufacturing investment tax credit of $2.6 billion in 2024 ($845 million in 2023), which may be refunded to us in cash to the extent it exceeds our outstanding income tax liabilities.\n- US state governments. We recognized $115 million of grants in 2024 related to modernization and expansion of chip factories in Oregon ($723 million in 2023 related to two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio).\n- Non-US governments. We recognized $384 million of grants and refundable tax credits in 2024 ($645 million in 2023), substantially all and a majority of which, respectively, related to the expansion of silicon wafer manufacturing facilities in Ireland.\n\nOperating-related incentives, including those recognized under the CHIPS A ct, benefited operating income by $442 million in 2024, the substantial majority of which was recorded in cost of sales ($202 million in 2023 and $104 million in 2022, a majority of which was recorded in cost of sales in both periods).\n\nT he amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to grants receivable and capital-related refundable tax credits for each period were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "What competitive advantages might Intel gain from its $7.9 billion in CHIPS Act funding that could impact Qualcomm's QCT segment, especially considering Qualcomm's complex revenue recognition challenges tied to customer incentive arrangements?",
      "answer": "Intel's $7.9 billion in CHIPS Act funding provides it with significant capital to expand trusted semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, reduce depreciation costs by hundreds of millions annually, and support strategic R&D and facility investments. This funding could enhance Intel's ability to compete in high-priority markets such as secure enclave programs. Meanwhile, Qualcomm's QCT segment, which generated $33.2 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue, faces complex revenue recognition challenges due to variable customer incentive arrangements, including rebates and marketing reimbursements, which require careful estimation and accrual management. These complexities may limit Qualcomm's short-term flexibility in pricing and market positioning. Therefore, Intel\u2019s government-backed financial strength could give it an edge in capacity expansion and cost competitiveness, potentially pressuring Qualcomm\u2019s QCT segment in key market segments where both companies may compete.",

          "chunk_text": "## Government Incentives\n\nWe enter into government incentive arrangements with local, regional, and national governments, both US and non-US. These arrangements vary in size, duration, and conditions and allow us to maintain a market-comparable foothold across various geographies. These incentives are primarily structured as cash grants and refundable tax credits. Capital-related incentives have terms of up to 15 years and operating-related incentives have terms that can vary widely. We are eligible to receiv e these incentiv es because we engage in qualifying capital investments, R&amp;D, and other activities as defined by the relevant government entities. These include qualifying capital investments for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging manufacturing facilities construction and acquisition of equipment. Each incentive requires that we comply with certain conditions for a period that may exceed the incentive terms. These conditions can include achievement of future operational targets and committing to minimum levels of capital investment. If conditions are not satisfied, the incentives may be subject to reduction, recapture, or termination. For example, in November 2024 we entered into a direct funding agreement with the US Department of Commerce under the CHIPS Act that contains detailed milestones we must achieve for us to receive the funds, including the achievement of various milestones with respect to capital expenditures, facility completion, process technology development, wafer production, Intel products insourcing, and external foundry customer acquisitions. It also contains restrictions on certain 'change of control' transactions we are permitted to engage in, a requirement that we share with the US government project economic returns above specified thresholds, and various termination rights and remedies if we were to breach the agreement, including potential repayment of some or all of the awards.\n\nCapital-related incentives reduced gross property, plant, and equipment by $9.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($5.5 billion as of December 30, 2023), of which $4.1 billion was recognized in 2024 ($2.2 billion in 2023). Capital-related incentives reduced depreciation expense by $594 million in 2024, of which the substantial majority reduced cost of sale s ($226 million in 2023, substantially all of which reduced cost of sales, and $230 million in 2022, all of which reduced cost of sales) . Of our total capital-related gov ernment incentives recognized in 2024, $3.3 billion was recognized as a non-cash investing activity ($1.1 billion in 2023 and $128 million in 2022). Related incentives recognized during each period consisted of the following:\n\n- US federal government pursuant to the CHIPS Act. In September 2024, we were awarded up to $3.0 billion in direct funding for the Secure Enclave program to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. In November 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the US Department of Commerce for the award of $7.9 billion in government incentives. We recognized $1.3 billion of grants, including $253 million of operating grants, in 2024 under the CHIPS A ct. A dditionally, we recognized an advanced manufacturing investment tax credit of $2.6 billion in 2024 ($845 million in 2023), which may be refunded to us in cash to the extent it exceeds our outstanding income tax liabilities.\n- US state governments. We recognized $115 million of grants in 2024 related to modernization and expansion of chip factories in Oregon ($723 million in 2023 related to two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio).\n- Non-US governments. We recognized $384 million of grants and refundable tax credits in 2024 ($645 million in 2023), substantially all and a majority of which, respectively, related to the expansion of silicon wafer manufacturing facilities in Ireland.\n\nOperating-related incentives, including those recognized under the CHIPS A ct, benefited operating income by $442 million in 2024, the substantial majority of which was recorded in cost of sales ($202 million in 2023 and $104 million in 2022, a majority of which was recorded in cost of sales in both periods).\n\nT he amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to grants receivable and capital-related refundable tax credits for each period were as follows:\n\n",

For certain QCT customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether the Company has the intent and contractual right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition of QCT customer incentive arrangements is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the completeness and accuracy of reductions to revenues and accruals for QCT customer incentives arrangements recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's review of and accounting for QCT customer incentive arrangements as well as controls relating to management's review over the completeness and accuracy of reductions to revenues in fiscal 2024 and accruals for QCT customer incentive arrangements as of the balance sheet date. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of reductions to revenues and accruals for QCT customer incentive arrangements recorded in the consolidated financial statements, and recalculating, on a test basis, reductions to revenues and accruals for QCT customer incentive arrangements based upon customer-specific contractual terms.\n\n## /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\n## San Diego, California\n\nNovember 6, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1985.",

      "answer": "Intel's co-marketing reimbursement programs, which partially reimburse customers for marketing activities involving products featuring Intel brands, play a key role in extending the reach of its brand awareness initiatives, particularly for products like the Intel Core Ultra and Xeon 6 processors. These programs involve advertising through digital and social media, press relations, and other activities aimed at driving demand. While Intel does not disclose the exact dollar amount spent on these programs, it emphasizes their importance in reinforcing the Intel brand pillars and expanding AI capabilities across data centers, cloud, edge, and PC platforms. In contrast, Qualcomm's QCT segment, which recorded $33.2 billion in revenues in fiscal 2024, explicitly accounts for reductions to revenue due to customer incentive arrangements, including marketing-related cost reimbursements. These incentives are used to drive adoption of Qualcomm's technologies, particularly in the mobile market where Snapdragon processors dominate. The financial structure of Qualcomm's approach\u2014where marketing incentives are directly tied to revenue recognition\u2014shows a more quantifiable impact on its financial statements compared to Intel's more qualitative disclosure around brand-building efforts.",

      "answer": "Microsoft experienced a 2% favorable foreign currency impact on its sales and marketing expenses in 2022, which helped offset some of the cost increases driven by strategic investments. Microsoft's total sales and marketing expenses rose by $1.7 billion or 8% during the year. In contrast, Oracle reported specific sales and marketing expense figures across its business segments for the same fiscal year: $7,054 million for Cloud and License, $361 million for Hardware, and $2,539 million for Services. This comparison suggests that while both companies incur significant sales and marketing costs, Microsoft's international exposure is more evident through the foreign currency effects on its expenses, whereas Oracle's reporting highlights the scale of its regional or global go-to-market operations by segment.",

      "question": "How does Intel's continued R&D investment in Mobileye despite its relatively modest operating income reflect its strategic positioning in autonomous driving technology, especially when contrasted with Accenture's strong overall operating income growth?",
      "answer": "Intel's R&D investment in Mobileye, despite its modest operating income of $690 million in 2022, signals a strategic bet on long-term growth in autonomous driving technology. This contrasts with Accenture's robust operating income growth of $1,746 million in 2022, which reflects its broad-based consulting success. While Mobileye's operating income grew only slightly year-over-year, Intel's decision to continue investing in it\u2014cited in its 2022 filing\u2014demonstrates a prioritization of future innovation and market positioning in automotive AI over short-term financial returns.

This requires that intelligence move closer to the edge, allowing data to be acted on where it is created. Working with our partners and developers, we use our architecture, accelerators, and software to develop and scale a growing Internet of Things portfolio and ecosystem. Our Internet of Things portfolio is comprised of our IOTG and Mobileye businesses.\n\n## Internet of Things Group\n\n## Overview\n\nIOTG develops high-performance compute platforms that solve the technology needs for business use cases that scale across vertical industries and embedded markets. Our customers include retailers, manufacturers, health and life sciences providers, researchers, governments, and education providers. We reduce complexity in the ecosystem with common silicon architectures and software to help enable our customers to create, store, and process data at the edge.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue was up 33%, driven by increased demand for IOTG platform products due to recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19 across all key market segments. Most notably, we saw strength in our retail, industrial, and healthcare market segments.\n- \u25a0 We announced enhanced product capabilities, which include the 11th Gen Intel Core processors and 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, both bring new AI and operational technology features to customers. These products are a response to needs across the verticals we serve to reduce edge complexity, add capabilities to developers, lower the cost of ownership, and support a range of environmental conditions.\n- \u25a0 We continue to update solutions to improve developers' digital strategies and to accelerate market adoption of AI applications at the edge. This includes advancing the OpenVINO toolkit for AI inference model deployment. It is supported by Intel DevCloud for the Edge, which allows users to prototype and experiment with AI workloads on Intel hardware prior to deployment. In addition, the Intel Edge Software Hub provides access to software packages from Intel and our partners to deliver proven business outcomes. \u00ae\n- \u25a0 We continue to work with our ecosystem partners to expand the portfolio of Intel MRS and Intel IoT RFP Ready Kit products-scalable, end-to-end solutions that provide solid business results today and lay the foundation for the future. Currently, IOTG has approved over 600 Intel MRS and Intel IoT RFP Ready Kit offerings, with approximately 50,000 new deployments across 160 countries. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n\"The market continues to validate the strategic direction we began several years ago; for operational workloads, compute will move closer to where the data is created and AI inference will be the dominant technology driver.\"\n\n-Tom Lantzsch, IOTG General Manager",

Our product portfolio covers the entire stack required for assisted and autonomous driving, including compute platforms, computer vision and machine learning-based sensing, mapping and localization, driving policy, and active sensors in development. Mobileye's unique assets in ADAS allow for building a scalable self-driving stack that meets the requirements for both Robotaxi and consumer level autonomy. Our customers and strategic partners include major global OEMs, Tier 1 automotive system integrators, and public transportation operators.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 We achieved record revenue in 2021 as global vehicle production improved amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19. Our EyeQ SoC volume grew 42% and we expect to see additional growth in the adoption of enhanced ADAS technologies. We have shipped over 100 million chips to date, including 28 million EyeQ SoCs in 2021.\n- \u25a0 We secured a record 41 new ADAS design wins, including deals with major OEMs such as Toyota, VW, BMW, Nissan, Honda, and PSA Group. We are currently active in 71 production programs  across over 30 OEMs. 1\n- \u25a0 We launched our SAE L4 SDS, Mobileye Drive\u2122, and secured multiple collaborations for commercial use, including with Udelv for autonomous cargo delivery, and with Transdev for selfdriving mobility services. We also achieved our first consumer L4 design win with Geely.\n- \u25a0 We unveiled the Mobileye Robotaxi, a production-grade self-driving electric vehicle, with mobility rider services and MaaS platform, as well as mobility intelligence, tele-operations and data services by Moovit. Through the partnership with SIXT, Robotaxi services will begin in Germany in 2022, along with the already announced Robotaxi services in Tel Aviv.\n- \u25a0 In December 2021, we announced our intention to take Mobileye public in the US via an IPO of newly issued Mobileye stock. Intel expects to retain majority ownership of Mobileye following the completion of the IPO.\n\n## 5-Year Trends 2\n\n## Market and Business Overview\n\n## Market Trends and Strategy\n\nWhile the vehicle industry shows recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic with approximately 2% growth year over year, production is still roughly 15% below 2019 levels. We expect ADAS volume to overcome the COVID-19 effects faster than overall global vehicle production, given the significant growth shown in 2021. We anticipate long-term ADAS growth from a strong build-up in L1-L2 ADAS fitment rates, increasing the number of vehicles that will have basic ADAS features from the factory. In addition, we expect increased demand for new generations of cloud-enhanced ADAS as OEMs continue to look to boost current L2 solutions by improving system fidelity, availability, and performance. A crucial building block for L4 autonomy, our REM highdefinition maps with constant updates, global coverage, and crowd-based semantics provide a unique value proposition for enhanced L2 systems. We see great traction from leading OEMs (including VW and Ford, as recently announced) as REM-based enhancements can be achieved based on economical configuration. 3\n\nWe believe the future of autonomous driving will unfold in two phases: commercial services like Robotaxi and cargo, followed by series-production passenger car consumer AVs. We expect consumer AVs to materialize only after the Robotaxi industry deploys and matures. The main inhibitors of a mass market product offering of consumer AV are the cost of AV technology, ability to scale at a low cost, regulatory framework, public acceptance, and the ability to scale geographically. Thus, we see the Robotaxi phase as a necessary corridor to consumer AV. Because of our scalable approach, Mobileye is well-positioned to play a significant role in both the Robotaxi market and the future consumer AV market. This is driven by three elements in our strategy: lean compute enabled by the tight co-design of hardware and software, REM crowdsourced maps that provide unparalleled global coverage and constant updates, and development of high-resolution imaging radars to reduce the use of costly LiDAR sensors.\n\n- This refers to the total number of production programs with active project managers. Intel's definition of program is included in \"Key Terms\" within the Financial Statements and Supplemental Details. 1\n- Mobileye was acquired in Q3 2017; 2017 results do not represent the full year. 2\n- Source: IHS Markit. 3\n\nMD&amp;A\n\n\"The future of autonomous driving will be driven by the expansion of Robotaxis, followed by the proliferation of consumer level AVs. While it is too early to determine which realm will dominate, Mobileye is uniquely positioned to become a leader in both spaces.\"\n\n-Prof. Amnon Shashua, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mobileye",

IOTG, Mobileye, NSG, and PSG do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. Our Internet of Things portfolio, presented as Internet of Things, is comprised of the IOTG and Mobileye operating segments. For 2021, the results of our Intel Optane memory business are included in our DCG operating segment, and our NSG segment is comprised of our NAND memory business to align to the pending divestiture of our NAND memory business. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\nWe have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.\n\nWe have an \"all other\" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:\n\n- results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented;\n- historical results of operations from divested businesses;\n- results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business;\n- amounts included within restructuring and other charges;\n- a portion of employee benefits, compensation, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and\n- acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.\n\nThe CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n83",
