      "answer": "AMT's significant operating revenues from India ($1,196.6M) and Brazil ($614.6M) suggest a high exposure to energy-intensive operations in regions where electricity prices can vary significantly. Since electricity prices directly impact operating revenues (as disclosed in EXC_10k_2022), any increase in power costs could reduce AMT\u2019s margins in these markets. This dynamic could indirectly affect SPG, which is exposed to electricity price volatility through its retail tenants whose sales volumes\u2014and thus rent payments\u2014are sensitive to energy costs. If rising electricity prices lead to weaker tenant performance, SPG could see a decline in overage rents tied to sales thresholds, impacting its overall lease income.",

Accordingly,  declines  in  our  tenants'  sales performance could reduce the income produced by our properties.\n\nSome of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract shoppers  and  we  could  be  materially  and  adversely  affected  by  the  loss  of  one  or  more  of  these anchors or tenants.\n\nOur  properties  are  typically  anchored  by  department  stores  and  other  large  nationally  recognized  tenants. Certain of our anchors and other tenants have ceased their operations, downsized their brick-and-mortar presence or failed to comply with their contractual obligations to us and others, and such actions have become more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSustained  adverse  pressure  on  the  results  of  department  stores  and  other  national  retailers  may  have  a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results. Certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future (given uncertainty with respect to current and future  macroeconomic  conditions  and  consumer  confidence  levels),  considerable  decreases  in  customer  traffic  in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the Internet and other forms of pressure on their business models. As pressure on these department stores and other national retailers increases, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, their ability to maintain their stores, meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers, withstand takeover attempts or avoid bankruptcy and/or liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or  their  seeking  of  a  lease  modification  with  us. Any  lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease current or future effective rents or expense recovery  charges.  Certain  other  tenants  are  entitled  to  modify  the  economic  or  other  terms  of,  or  terminate,  their existing leases with us in the event of such closures.  Additionally, corporate merger or consolidation activity among department  stores  and  other  national  retailers  typically  results  in  the  closure  of  duplicate  or  geographically overlapping store locations.\n\nIf a department store or large nationally recognized tenant were to close its stores at our properties, we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in re-tenanting the space, as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant store, at attractive rates, or at all. Additionally, department store or tenant closures may result  in  decreased  customer  traffic,  which  could  lead  to  decreased  sales  at  our  properties.  If  the  sales  of  stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers, adverse  economic  conditions  or  other  reasons,  tenants  may  be  unable  to  pay  their  minimum  rents  or  expense recovery charges. In the event of any default by a tenant, we may not be able to fully recover, and/or may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover, amounts due to us under the terms of our leases with such parties.\n\n## We face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies.\n\nBankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations.  Although we did not see an increase in  tenant  bankruptcies  in  2021,  in  previous  years  a  number  of  companies  in  the  retail  industry,  including certain of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy, and these numbers have increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a tenant files for bankruptcy, the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us, and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner.

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nSince inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we lease primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nIn 2021, we added approximately 31,000 communications sites to our portfolios in Latin America and Europe and launched operations in Spain as part of our transaction with Telxius Telecom, S.A. ('Telxius,' and the acquisition, the 'Telxius Acquisition,' as further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview'). In addition, we launched operations in the Philippines through the construction of new sites therein and in Bangladesh through the acquisition of a controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited (the 'Bangladesh Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our communications real estate portfolio of 220,131 communications sites included 43,308 communications sites in the U.S. &amp; Canada, 75,725 communications sites in AsiaPacific, 22,165 communications sites in Africa, 30,041 communications sites in Europe and 48,892 communications sites in Latin America, as well as urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico and South Africa and other property interests in Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite'), consisting of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite's existing debt (the 'CoreSite Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our data center portfolio consisted of 27 data center facilities across ten United States markets, including the assets acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition, as well as our previously acquired data center facilities.\n\nIn May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements with Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz'), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of our operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, 'ATC Europe,' and the transactions, the 'ATC Europe Transactions'). We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in\n\n## PART I",

The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $12.8 million and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid $7.5 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. To maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT, the Company expects to continue paying distributions, the amount, timing and frequency of which will be determined, and subject to adjustment, by the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## 16.    NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n\nDividend to noncontrolling interest -Certain of the Company's subsidiaries may, from time to time, declare dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2021, AT Iberia C.V. declared a dividend of 14.0 million EUR (approximately $15.9 million) payable pursuant to the terms of the ownership agreements to ATC Europe and PGGM in proportion to their respective equity interests in AT Iberia C.V. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the subsidiary that primarily consisted of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Poland ('Former ATC Europe') declared a dividend of 13.2 million EUR (approximately $16.2 million as of December 31, 2020) payable in cash to the Company and PGGM in proportion to their respective equity interests in Former ATC Europe. The dividend was paid on January 6, 2021.\n\nPurchase of Interests -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased the remaining minority interests held in a subsidiary in the United States for total consideration of $6.0 million. The purchase price was settled with unregistered shares of the Company's common stock, in lieu of cash. The Company now owns 100% of the subsidiary as a result of the purchase.\n\nReorganization of European Interests -During the year ended December 31, 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, the Company completed a reorganization of its subsidiaries in Europe. As part of the reorganization, PGGM converted its previously held 49% noncontrolling interest in Former ATC Europe into noncontrolling interests in new subsidiaries, consisting of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, inclusive of the assets acquired pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition. The reorganization included cash consideration paid to PGGM of 178.0 million EUR (approximately $214.9 million). The reorganization is reflected in the consolidated statements of equity as (i) a reduction in Additional Paid-in Capital of $648.4 million and (ii) an increase in Noncontrolling Interests of $601.0 million, and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as an increase in Comprehensive income attributable to American Tower Corporation stockholders of $47.4 million.\n\nCDPQ and Allianz Partnerships -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into agreements with Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz'), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe (the 'ATC Europe Transactions'). The Company completed the ATC Europe Transactions during the year ended December 31, 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, the Company holds a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, ATC Europe consists of the Company's operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain. The Company currently holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, with CDPQ and Allianz holding 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively. ATC Europe holds a 100% interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in France and Poland and an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively, with PGGM holding a 13% and a 17% noncontrolling interest in each respective subsidiary.\n\nBangladesh Partnership -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in KTBL for 900 million BDT (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing).

The Company recorded a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of approximately $12.4 million, which included prepayment consideration of $12.1 million and the associated unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. The redemption was funded with cash on hand.

This series of preferred units accrues cumulative quarterly distributions at a rate of $7.50 annually. The preferred units are redeemable by the Operating Partnership upon the death of the survivor of the original holders, or the transfer of any preferred units to any person or entity other than the persons or entities entitled to the benefits of the original holder. The redemption price is the liquidation value ($100.00 per preferred unit) plus accrued and unpaid distributions, payable either in cash or fully registered shares of common stock  at  our  election.  In  the  event  of  the  death  of  a  holder  of  the  preferred  units,  the  occurrence  of  certain  tax triggering events applicable to the holder, or on or after November 10, 2006, the holder may require the Operating Partnership  to  redeem  the  preferred  units  at  the  same  redemption  price  payable  at  the  option  of  the  Operating Partnership in either cash or shares of common stock.  These preferred units have a carrying value of $25.5 million and are included in limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## The Operating Partnership\n\nThe Operating Partnership classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that the Operating Partnership could be required to redeem the security for cash, irrespective of the probability of such a possibility.    As  a  result,  the  Operating  Partnership  classifies  one  series  of  preferred  units  and  noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity.  Each of these securities is discussed further below.\n\nNoncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties Redeemable instruments, which typically represent the remaining noncontrolling interests in a property or portfolio of properties, and which are redeemable at the option of  the  holder  or  in  circumstances  that  may  be  outside  our  control,  are  accounted  for  as  temporary  equity.    The carrying  amount  of  the  noncontrolling  interest  is  adjusted  to  the  redemption  amount  assuming  the  instrument  is redeemable at the balance sheet date.  Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are recorded  within  equity  and  are  presented  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  equity  in  the  line  issuance  of  unit equivalents and other.  There are no noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of December  31,  2021  and  2020.

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

      "answer": "AMT allocated $305 million to buildings and improvements in the InSite Acquisition, which falls under its assets acquired reporting. SPG, on the other hand, depreciates buildings and improvements over 10\u201335 years for the structure, 15 years for landscaping and parking lots, and 10 years for HVAC equipment. This depreciation policy would influence how the $305 million allocated by AMT is treated over time if similar assets were owned by SPG, highlighting differing asset lifecycle management strategies between the two companies.",

      "answer": "SPG reported a $116.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2019, which directly reduced its FFO. This compares to AMT's 2021 Nareit FFO attributable to common stockholders of $4,753.3 million, which included various adjustments such as a $38.2 million loss on retirement of long-term obligations. While SPG's one-time loss represented a significant reduction in FFO for that year, AMT's FFO adjustments were more diversified and less concentrated in debt-related losses, indicating differing capital structure management strategies between the two companies.",

      "answer": "Simon Property Group must distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income annually, which can strain liquidity and force the company to access capital on unfavorable terms during periods of high interest rates, as noted in its 2023 10-K. High interest rates, as part of the broader macroeconomic environment, have tightened capital availability, as confirmed in RTX's 2023 10-K. American Tower, in turn, faces currency risks from its international operations, which are exacerbated by the same high interest rate environment affecting global markets and exchange rates. This creates a compounded challenge for both firms, with SPG facing liquidity constraints and AMT dealing with foreign exchange volatility that impacts reported revenues and planning accuracy.",

      "answer": "SPG explicitly excludes deferred financing costs from its encumbrances disclosures, which include $112,087 for Southridge Mall and $5,173,819 in total, indicating that these costs are not part of the face value of mortgage debt on properties. In contrast, AMT reports $49.8 million in amortization of deferred financing costs in 2023 as part of operating cash flows and also lists $144.5 million in deferred financing costs under financing activities, showing a direct impact on both income reconciliation and cash outflows. This suggests that while SPG separates deferred financing costs from debt valuation, AMT actively amortizes and incurs new deferred financing costs, affecting both its income statement and cash flow statement.",

        "Hop 1: SPG \u2192 Encumbrances: SPG discloses encumbrances totaling $5,173,819, including $112,087 for Southridge Mall, but explicitly excludes deferred financing costs from this figure.",

      "answer": "SPG's Operating Partnership offers a redemption price for its 7.50% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units equal to the liquidation value of $100.00 per unit plus accrued and unpaid distributions, with the option to pay in cash or registered shares of common stock. In contrast, AMT redeemed its 4.70% Senior Notes at a price of 101.7270% of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, totaling approximately $715.1 million, and funded the redemption with cash on hand. While SPG provides a redemption mechanism tied to equity instruments with flexibility in settlement form, AMT incurred a fixed premium and interest payment funded directly through existing liquidity, highlighting different approaches to capital structure management and redemption obligations.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

This series of preferred units accrues cumulative quarterly distributions at a rate of $7.50 annually. The preferred units are redeemable by the Operating Partnership upon the death of the survivor of the original holders, or the transfer of any preferred units to any person or entity other than the persons or entities entitled to the benefits of the original holder. The redemption price is the liquidation value ($100.00 per preferred unit) plus accrued and unpaid distributions, payable either in cash or fully registered shares of common stock  at  our  election.  In  the  event  of  the  death  of  a  holder  of  the  preferred  units,  the  occurrence  of  certain  tax triggering events applicable to the holder, or on or after November 10, 2006, the holder may require the Operating Partnership  to  redeem  the  preferred  units  at  the  same  redemption  price  payable  at  the  option  of  the  Operating Partnership in either cash or shares of common stock.  These preferred units have a carrying value of $25.5 million and are included in limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## The Operating Partnership\n\nThe Operating Partnership classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that the Operating Partnership could be required to redeem the security for cash, irrespective of the probability of such a possibility.    As  a  result,  the  Operating  Partnership  classifies  one  series  of  preferred  units  and  noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity.  Each of these securities is discussed further below.\n\nNoncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties Redeemable instruments, which typically represent the remaining noncontrolling interests in a property or portfolio of properties, and which are redeemable at the option of  the  holder  or  in  circumstances  that  may  be  outside  our  control,  are  accounted  for  as  temporary  equity.    The carrying  amount  of  the  noncontrolling  interest  is  adjusted  to  the  redemption  amount  assuming  the  instrument  is redeemable at the balance sheet date.  Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are recorded  within  equity  and  are  presented  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  equity  in  the  line  issuance  of  unit equivalents and other.  There are no noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of December  31,  2021  and  2020.    The  following  table  summarizes  the  preferred  units  and  the  amount  of  the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as of December 31.\n\n",

EURIBOR applies to the EUR denominated borrowings under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and all of the borrowings under the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan.\n\n(2)    Fee on undrawn portion of each credit facility.\n\n(3)    Subject to two optional renewal periods.\n\nThe loan agreements for each of the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the Company must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent the Company from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding under the applicable agreement, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.\n\n## Senior Notes\n\n## Repayments of Senior Notes\n\nRepayment of 4.70% Senior NotesOn October 18, 2021, the Company redeemed all of its 4.70% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the '4.70% Notes') at a price equal to 101.7270% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding October 18, 2021, for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $715.1 million, including $3.0 million in accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of approximately $12.4 million, which included prepayment consideration of $12.1 million and the associated unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. The redemption was funded with cash on hand. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 4.70% Notes remained outstanding.\n\n## Offerings of Senior Notes\n\n1.600% Senior Notes and 2.700% Senior Notes OfferingOn March 29, 2021, the Company completed a registered public offering of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.600% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the '1.600% Notes') and $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.700% senior unsecured notes due 2031 (the '2.700% Notes'). The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1,386.3 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. The Company used all of the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility.\n\n0.450% Senior Notes, 0.875% Senior Notes and 1.250% Senior Notes OfferingOn May 21, 2021, the Company completed a registered public offering of 750.0 million EUR ($913.7 million at the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of 0.450% senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the '0.450% Notes'), 750.0 million EUR ($913.7 million at the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of 0.875% senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the '0.875% Notes') and 500.0 million EUR ($609.1 million at the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of 1.250% senior unsecured notes due 2033 (the '1.250% Notes'). The net proceeds from this offering were approximately 1,983.1 million EUR (approximately $2,415.8 million at the date of issuance), after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. The Company used all of the net proceeds to fund the Telxius Acquisition.\n\n1.450% Senior Notes, 2.300% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes Offering -On September 27, 2021, the Company completed a registered public offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.450% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the '1.450% Notes'), $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.300% senior unsecured notes due 2031 (the",

      "answer": "SPG's $116.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2019 directly reduced its FFO, as noted in the FFO reconciliation section of its 2022 10-K filing. This loss represents a significant non-operational expense that negatively impacts FFO, which measures ongoing operating performance. In contrast, AMT's FFO attributable to common stockholders was $4,753.3 million in 2021, supported in part by $2,093.5 million in real estate-related depreciation and amortization, which is a recurring, non-cash adjustment that positively contributes to FFO. While SPG's debt extinguishment loss detracted from FFO, AMT's FFO was bolstered by substantial non-cash real estate adjustments, highlighting different drivers of FFO performance between the two REITs.",

      "answer": "The regulatory Commissions' decisions on cost recovery (as seen in the SO_10k_2023.pdf) directly affect how utility companies recover leasing and operational costs through rate-setting, which creates precedent for how leasing cost recovery is evaluated in regulated environments. SPG, in its impairment and fair value estimates (SPG_10k_2023.pdf), relies on assumptions about leasing prospects and recovery of costs such as leasing commissions and in-place lease values, which are integral to asset valuation and depreciation schedules. Similarly, AMT records in-place lease value as part of its intangible assets, specifically referencing avoided leasing commissions as a key component of fair value (AMT_10k_2023.pdf). If regulatory Commissions limit the recovery of leasing-related costs, this would constrain the assumptions SPG and AMT use in estimating fair value and amortization periods for these intangibles, potentially shortening amortization schedules or requiring impairment charges if recoverability is uncertain.",

      "answer": "Simon Property Group declared a dividend of $1.65 per share for Q1 2022, reflecting its full control over dividend policy as a traditional REIT with no third-party ownership interests. In contrast, American Tower Corporation's capital distribution strategy involves a more complex structure due to its 52% ownership in ATC Europe, where it shares control with CDPQ (30%) and Allianz (18%). The 14.0 million EUR dividend (approximately $15.9 million) declared by AT Iberia C.V. was distributed according to ownership stakes, highlighting how AMT\u2019s REIT obligations must be balanced with minority interests in its European operations. This illustrates differing financial strategies: SPG maintains full discretion over shareholder returns, while AMT must coordinate distributions with noncontrolling partners, affecting both timing and magnitude of cash flows to its own shareholders.",

        "Hop 1: SPG \u2192 Dividend Declaration: SPG declared a $1.65 per share dividend for Q1 2022, reflecting its REIT structure and full control over distributions.",

The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $12.8 million and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid $7.5 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. To maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT, the Company expects to continue paying distributions, the amount, timing and frequency of which will be determined, and subject to adjustment, by the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## 16.    NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n\nDividend to noncontrolling interest -Certain of the Company's subsidiaries may, from time to time, declare dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2021, AT Iberia C.V. declared a dividend of 14.0 million EUR (approximately $15.9 million) payable pursuant to the terms of the ownership agreements to ATC Europe and PGGM in proportion to their respective equity interests in AT Iberia C.V. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the subsidiary that primarily consisted of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Poland ('Former ATC Europe') declared a dividend of 13.2 million EUR (approximately $16.2 million as of December 31, 2020) payable in cash to the Company and PGGM in proportion to their respective equity interests in Former ATC Europe. The dividend was paid on January 6, 2021.\n\nPurchase of Interests -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased the remaining minority interests held in a subsidiary in the United States for total consideration of $6.0 million. The purchase price was settled with unregistered shares of the Company's common stock, in lieu of cash. The Company now owns 100% of the subsidiary as a result of the purchase.\n\nReorganization of European Interests -During the year ended December 31, 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, the Company completed a reorganization of its subsidiaries in Europe. As part of the reorganization, PGGM converted its previously held 49% noncontrolling interest in Former ATC Europe into noncontrolling interests in new subsidiaries, consisting of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, inclusive of the assets acquired pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition. The reorganization included cash consideration paid to PGGM of 178.0 million EUR (approximately $214.9 million). The reorganization is reflected in the consolidated statements of equity as (i) a reduction in Additional Paid-in Capital of $648.4 million and (ii) an increase in Noncontrolling Interests of $601.0 million, and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as an increase in Comprehensive income attributable to American Tower Corporation stockholders of $47.4 million.\n\nCDPQ and Allianz Partnerships -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into agreements with Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz'), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe (the 'ATC Europe Transactions'). The Company completed the ATC Europe Transactions during the year ended December 31, 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, the Company holds a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, ATC Europe consists of the Company's operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain. The Company currently holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, with CDPQ and Allianz holding 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively. ATC Europe holds a 100% interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in France and Poland and an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively, with PGGM holding a 13% and a 17% noncontrolling interest in each respective subsidiary.\n\nBangladesh Partnership -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in KTBL for 900 million BDT (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing). Confidence Group holds a 49% noncontrolling interest in KTBL.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nSince inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we lease primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nIn 2021, we added approximately 31,000 communications sites to our portfolios in Latin America and Europe and launched operations in Spain as part of our transaction with Telxius Telecom, S.A. ('Telxius,' and the acquisition, the 'Telxius Acquisition,' as further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview'). In addition, we launched operations in the Philippines through the construction of new sites therein and in Bangladesh through the acquisition of a controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited (the 'Bangladesh Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our communications real estate portfolio of 220,131 communications sites included 43,308 communications sites in the U.S. &amp; Canada, 75,725 communications sites in AsiaPacific, 22,165 communications sites in Africa, 30,041 communications sites in Europe and 48,892 communications sites in Latin America, as well as urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico and South Africa and other property interests in Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite'), consisting of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite's existing debt (the 'CoreSite Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our data center portfolio consisted of 27 data center facilities across ten United States markets, including the assets acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition, as well as our previously acquired data center facilities.\n\nIn May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements with Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz'), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of our operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, 'ATC Europe,' and the transactions, the 'ATC Europe Transactions'). We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in\n\n## PART I",

      "question": "How does the difference in amortization strategies for leasing commissions between AMT and SPG reflect their respective regulatory or cost recovery frameworks, and what role do regulatory Commissions play in shaping these approaches?",
      "answer": "AMT includes leasing commissions as part of in-place lease value, which is amortized over up to 20 years, factoring in lease renewal options and residual value. This long-term amortization reflects an expectation of sustained tenant relationships and stable revenue. In contrast, SPG amortizes leasing commissions over the remaining life of the underlying leases without reference to renewal periods, aligning costs more closely with lease terms rather than potential extensions. Regulatory Commissions influence these strategies by setting the framework for cost recovery in rate-regulated environments, as seen in Southern Company Gas filings, where recovery of prudently incurred costs is subject to Commission approval and timing. This regulatory oversight shapes how companies like AMT and SPG recognize and amortize leasing-related costs based on their exposure to regulatory frameworks versus market-driven real estate operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMT \u2192 Commissions: AMT includes leasing commissions as part of in-place lease value, which is amortized over up to 20 years, factoring in lease renewal options and residual value, indicating long-term revenue expectations.",
        "Hop 2: Commissions \u2192 Cost Recovery: Regulatory Commissions determine the recovery of prudently incurred costs in regulated environments, including the timing and amount of asset recovery through rates, which influences how companies structure and amortize leasing-related expenses.",
        "Hop 3: Cost Recovery \u2190 SPG: SPG amortizes leasing commissions over the remaining life of the underlying leases, without considering renewal periods, reflecting a market-driven approach where cost recovery aligns with lease terms rather than regulatory approval."
