In contrast, MMM noted that its gross realized gains and losses were not material, suggesting a more conservative or passive investment approach. UPS reported much smaller gross realized gains of $5 million in 2024, showing a significantly lower level of realization activity compared to GE. These differences highlight varying levels of engagement with marketable securities and distinct thresholds for materiality disclosures.",

However, for our non-U.S. based entities, such as Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (P&amp;WC), a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies. Consequently, there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as U.S. Dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the Canadian Dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations. Additionally, we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against these other currencies, we hedge a certain portion of sales to secure  the  rates  at  which  U.S.  Dollars  will  be  converted.  The  majority  of  this  hedging  activity  occurs  at  P&amp;WC  and  Collins Aerospace,  and  hedging  activity  also  occurs  to  a  lesser  extent  at  the  remainder  of  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney.  At  P&amp;WC  and  Collins Aerospace,  firm  and  forecasted  sales  for  both  original  equipment  and  spare  parts  are  hedged  at  varying  amounts  for  up  to  49 months  on  the  U.S.  Dollar  sales  exposure  as  represented  by  the  excess  of  U.S.  Dollar  sales  over  U.S.  Dollar  denominated purchases.  Hedging  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  movements  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  are  partially  offset  by  the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. While the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results, there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts, changes in the sales profile, volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk. We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations. A 100 basis points unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate $4 billion impact on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we believe our exposure to interest rate risk on our fixed-rate debt is not material. From time to time, we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures, but may consider such strategies in the future.",

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a 5-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized in net income immediately, but are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and, if necessary, amortized as pension expense.\n\nThe components of our net periodic pension cost were as follows for the years ended  December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n\n",

In contrast, General Dynamics had no commercial paper outstanding but maintained a $4 billion committed credit facility to access the commercial paper market if needed, suggesting a more conservative or standby liquidity strategy. 3M, which had $1.8 billion in commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2023, reduced this to zero by the end of 2024, signaling a deliberate reduction in short-term debt reliance.

The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include the results of continuing and discontinued operations and, therefore, also include cash and cash equivalents associated with Solventum through its April 2024 separation from 3M that were presented in current assets of discontinued operations in the 3M Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities:\n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as working capital movements, tax timing differences and other items such as litigation payments can significantly impact cash flows.\n\nIn 2024, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $4.9 billion compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by approximately $4.6 billion in payments associated with PFAS-related other environmental liabilities and the CAE legal settlement (both discussed in Note 19). The 2023 pre-tax charges of $10.5 billion related to the PWS Settlement and of $4.3 billion (inclusive of imputed interest) related to the CAE Settlement largely impacted the net income component within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, with offsets in the other-net and deferred tax elements.\n\n## Cash Flows from Investing Activities:\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E) enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. 3M invested $1.2 billion on PP&amp;E in 2024. The Company expects 2025 capital spending to be approximately $1.1 billion as 3M continues to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability.\n\n3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.\n\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Note 13 for more details about 3M's diversified marketable securities portfolio.\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\n\n## 2024 Debt Activity :\n\nDebt cash flow activity includes proceeds from Solventum's issuance of $8.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt in the first quarter of 2024 partially offset by $2.9 billion in debt maturities, consisting of $1.1 billion of medium-term notes and $1.8 billion repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Gross commercial paper issuances and repayments, in addition to repayments of the fixed-rate notes, are largely reflected in 'Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days)' and \"Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days)\". The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.8 billion commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023. 3M's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 14 for more detail regarding debt.\n\n## 2023 Debt Activity:\n\nDebt cash flow activity included maturities of $1.8 billion of fix ed-rate notes offset by net issuances of commercial paper of $1.8 billion (issuance and subsequent repayments/reissuances). The gross commercial paper issuances and repayments, in addition to repayments of the fixed-rate notes, are largely reflected in 'Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days)' and \"Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days)\".\n\n## Repurchases of Common Stock:\n\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company's stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2024, the Company purchased $1.8 billion of its own stock. For more information, refer to the table titled 'Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities' in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company's stock.\n\n## Dividends Paid to Shareholders:\n\n3M has paid dividends since 1916. Cash dividends declared and paid totaled $1.51 per share for the first quarter of 2024; $0.70 per share for each of the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2024; and $1.50 per share for each quarter in 2023. In February 2025, 3M's Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2025 dividend of $0.73 per share, an increase of 4 percent.",

Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. As a result of these transactions, the equity interest and note receiv able are reported as held-for-sale in the prior year, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, hav e been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented, and cash flows related to U.S. tax distributions hav e been reclassified to operating cash flows from discontinued operations (see Notes 5 and 8).\n\nIn 2024, the Company adopted ASU No. 2022-04 (Subtopic 405-50), Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs, which requires disclosures about the use of supplier finance programs. This standard has no impact on the accounting for supplier finance programs and did not materially impact the Company's disclosures.\n\nIn 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2021-10 (Topic 832), Government Assistance, which requires annual disclosures about certain types of government assistance receiv ed. This standard has no impact on the accounting for gov ernment assistance and did not materially impact the Company's disclosures.\n\nIn 2022, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates, each of which had an immaterial or no impact on the Company's financial statements. These included:\n\n- Updates to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations , which clarify the accounting for contract assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair v alue in accordance with the general requirements of ASC 805.\n- Updates to ASC 740, Income Taxes , which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income based tax. These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim tax calculations.\n- Updates to ASC 321, Equity Securities , ASC 323 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures , and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , which clarify how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when ev aluating observ able transactions.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled affiliates. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Inv estments of 20 percent to 50 percent of the v oting shares of other entities are accounted for by the equity method. Inv estments in publicly traded companies of less than 20 percent are carried at fair v alue, with changes in fair v alue reflected in earnings. Inv estments in nonpublicly traded companies of less than 20 percent are carried at cost, minus impairment, and adjusted for observ able price changes in orderly transactions.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nThe functional currency for most of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in accumulated other comprehensiv e income.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GA A P), which requires us to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements. A lthough our current estimates contemplate current and expected future conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such changes could result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets, contract assets and investment securities, revisions to estimated profitability on long-term product service agreements, incremental credit losses on receivables and debt securities, incremental losses related to our contingencies, a change in the carrying amount of our tax assets and liabilities, or a change in our insurance liabilities and pension obligations as of the time of a relevant measurement event.\n\nIn preparing our Statement of Cash Flows, we make certain adjustments to reflect cash flows that cannot otherwise be calculated by changes in our Statement of Financial Position. These adjustments may include, but are not limited to, the effects of currency exchange, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, businesses classified as held for sale, the timing of settlements to suppliers for property, plant and equipment, non-cash gains/losses and other balance sheet reclassifications.\n\nWe have reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year's presentation. Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for earnings from continuing operations, earnings from discontinued operations and net earnings. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total. Unless otherwise indicated, information in these notes to consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Certain of our operations have been presented as discontinued. We present businesses whose disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results as discontinued operations when the components meet the criteria for held for sale, are sold, or spun-off.\n\nOn April 2, 2024 and January 3, 2023, General Electric Company, now operating as GE A erospace, completed the previously announced separation of GE Vernova and its separation of GE HealthCare, respectively, which resulted in three independent, publicly traded companies - GE A erospace, GE V ernova and GE HealthCare. We are organized into two business segments that are aligned with the industries we serve: Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies. The historical results of GE V ernova and GE HealthCare are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. See Notes 2 and 25 for further information.\n\nCONSOLIDATION. Our financial statements consolidate all of our affiliates, entities where we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest, or where we are required to apply the variable interest entity (V IE) model and we have the power to direct the most economically significant activities of entities. We reev aluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in all entities when our rights and interests change. A ll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nREVENUE FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT. We recognize revenue for equipment including commercial install and spare aircraft engines, defense aircraft engines, and other products we manufacture at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (time between shipment and delivery).\n\nWhere arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment, and that acceptance is likely to occur. We do not provide for anticipated losses on point-in-time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.\n\nOur billing terms for these contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer. We sometimes offer our customers financing discounts for the purchase of certain equipment when sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements. These sales are accounted for as financing arrangements when payments for the equipment are collected through higher usage-based fees from servicing the equipment. In some contracts, we receive progress collections from customers for large equipment purchases. Progress collections are not considered a significant financing component as they are used to meet working capital demands and protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. For certain commercial engine programs, we make payments to airlines when the aircraft with our engines are delivered by the airframers (aircraft allowances). We record aircraft allowances as a reduction in revenue when control of the engine is transferred to our airframer customer.\n\nSome of our contracts require us to make payments to customers related to failure to deliver our equipment on-time or meeting certain performance specifications, which is factored into our estimate of variable consideration using the expected value method taking into consideration performance relative to our contractual obligations, specified liquidated damages rates, if applicable, and history of paying damages to the customer or similar customers.\n\nREVENUE FROM THE SALE OF SERVICES. Spare Parts. We sell certain tangible products, largely spare parts, through our services businesses. We recognize revenue and bill our customers at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is when we deliver the spare part to the customer. In some cases, our contracts give rise to variable consideration in the form of volume or product durability discounts, which we incorporate into our estimate of transaction price using the expected value method. Delivery is measured using either proof of delivery or estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (time between shipment and delivery).",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nThe financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of A merica. The following is a description of Honeywell's significant accounting policies.\n\n## PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. The Company's consolidation policy requires equity investments that the Company exercises significant influence over, but does not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities, to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which the Company does not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## USE OF ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company makes certain estimates and assumptions in determining the amounts reflected in the financial statements and the related notes. A ctual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## RECLASSIFICATIONS\n\nCertain prior year amounts are reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the  Company realigned certain of its business units as reflected in Note 22 Segment Financial Data,  which  impacted  the composition of its reportable segments. The Company recast historical periods to reflect this change in segment presentation.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nThe Company considers the applicability and impact of all A ccounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial A ccounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flows (Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n- In  November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , which requires companies to disclose additional information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The new standard requires tabular disclosure of specified natural expenses in certain expense captions, a qualitative description of amounts that are not separately disaggregated, and disclosure of the Company's definition and total amount of selling expenses. The ASU should be applied prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, with retrospective application and early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of this guidance on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- In  December  2023,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2023-09, Income  T axes  (T opic  740):  Improvements  to  Income  T axes  Disclosures ,  which  requires  greater disaggregation of income tax disclosures. The new standard requires additional information to be disclosed with respect to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. This A SU should be applied prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of this guidance on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- In  November  2023,  the  FA SB  issued  A SU  2023-07, Segment  Reporting  (T opic  280):  Improvements  to  Reportable  Segment  Disclosures ,  which  requires companies to enhance the disclosures about segment expenses. The new standard requires the disclosure of the Company's Chief Operating Decision M aker (CODM), expanded incremental line-item disclosures of significant segment expenses used by the CODM  for decision-making, and the inclusion of previous annual only segment disclosure requirements on a quarterly basis. This ASU should be applied retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance for annual disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2024. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n57 Honeywell International Inc.",

The U.S. gov ernment can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\n\nCommercial  Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations  gov erning  production  and  quality systems, airworthiness and installation approv als, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. For example, as a result of the Alaska Airlines 737-9 accident in January 2024, the FAA inv estigated the 737 quality control system, including Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), and increased its  ov ersight  of  our  production  and  quality  and  safety  management  systems.  In  addition,  the  FAA  communicated  it  will  not  approv e  production  rate increases beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. New aircraft models and  new  deriv ativ e  aircraft  are  required  to  obtain  FAA  certification  prior  to  entry  into  serv ice.  Outside  the  U.S.,  similar  requirements  exist  for airworthiness, installation and operational approv als. T hese requirements are generally administered by the national av iation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Union Av iation Safety Agency.\n\nEnvironmental. We  are  subject  to  v arious  federal,  state,  local  and  non-U.S.  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  env ironmental  protection,  including  the utilization,  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal  and  remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  could  also  be  affected  by  laws  and regulations relating to climate change, including laws limiting or otherwise related to greenhouse gas emissions. These laws and regulations could lead to increased env ironmental compliance expenditures, increased energy and raw materials costs and new and/or additional inv estment in designs and technologies.  We  continually  assess  our  compliance  status  and  management  of  env ironmental  matters  to  monitor  compliance  with  applicable environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Inv estigation,  remediation  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  associated  with  env ironmental  compliance  and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. gov ernment. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued env ironmental compliance could hav e a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discov ered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of inv estigations. For additional information relating to env ironmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNon-U.S. Sales. Our non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. gov ernmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, inv estment, exchange controls, anti-corruption and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to v arying currency, political and economic risks.\n\n## Raw Materials, Parts and Subassemblies\n\nWe are highly dependent on the av ailability and quality of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. T he most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions)  and  composites  (including  carbon  and  boron).  Although  alternativ e  sources  generally  exist  for  these  raw  materials,  qualification  of  the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis. We continue to work with a small number of sole-source suppliers to ensure continuity of supply for certain items.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nWe are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and deliv ery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensiv e qualification and performance surv eillance system to control risk",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Note 14 - Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nWe are a party to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment, and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the company as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings and cash flows in the period in which it is recognized. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.\n\nAlthough we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. We follow a thorough process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.\n\n## Lockheed Martin v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority\n\nOn April 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the New Y ork Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its Capital Construction Company (collectively, the MTA) asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Y ork to find that the MTA is in material breach of our agreement based on the MTA's failure to provide access to sites where work must be performed and the customer-furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract. The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTA's allegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTA's termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $ 95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District Court in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. We continue to await a decision from the District Court. Although this matter relates to our former Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions business (IS&amp;GS), we retained responsibility for the litigation when we divested IS&amp;GS in 2016.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nWe are involved in proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil, sediment, surface water, and groundwater contamination, disposal of hazardous substances, and other environmental matters at several of our current or former facilities, facilities for which we may have contractual responsibility, and at third-party sites where we have been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP). A substantial portion of environmental costs will be included in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S. G overnment regulations. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record assets for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the U.S. G overnment, regardless of the contract form (e.g., costreimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. G overnment regulations, our U.S. G overnment business base and contract mix, and our history of receiving reimbursement of such  costs.  We  include  the  portions  of  those  environmental  costs  ex pected  to  be  allocated  to  our  non-U.S.  G overnment  contracts,  or  determined  not  to  be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established or adjusted.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate amount of liabilities recorded relative to environmental matters was $677 million and $680 million, most of which are recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We have recorded assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery totaling $619 million and",

      "question": "How do General Dynamics, GE, and Honeywell differ in their treatment of state deferred tax liabilities in 2024, and what does this reveal about their respective tax strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2024, General Dynamics reported a state deferred tax liability of $4 million, indicating a relatively minor impact from state-level deferred tax adjustments. GE, in contrast, showed a significantly higher state deferred tax liability of $128 million, suggesting a more pronounced exposure to state tax obligations or strategic decisions affecting deferred liabilities. Honeywell reported a state deferred tax liability of $25 million, placing it between GD and GE in terms of magnitude. These differences suggest varied approaches to managing state-level tax exposures, with GE bearing the highest deferred liability, potentially reflecting more aggressive tax planning or larger operational footprints in high-tax states.",

Non-U.S. losses also limit our ability to claim U.S. foreign tax credits on certain operations, further increasing the rate of tax on non-U.S. operations. In addition, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax on 'base eroding' payments from the U.S. We have taken restructuring actions to mitigate the impact from this provision. The U.S. has also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low tax income). Because we have tangible assets outside the U.S. and pay significant foreign taxes, we generally do not expect a significant increase in tax liability from this new U.S. minimum tax. Overall, these newly enacted provisions increase the rate of tax on our non-U.S. operations.\n\n",

Shares are valued at the market price on the date of award. The terms of our restricted stock provide for continued vesting subsequent to the employee's retirement. Compensation expense associated with these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the requisite service period or the stated vesting period.\n\nASSUMPTIONS . The key assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation method include the expected life of the option, stock price volatility, a risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The following table includes the weighted-average Black-Scholes value per share of our stock option grants, the intrinsic value of options exercised (in millions), and the key weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation calculations for options granted during the years ended May 31, followed by a discussion of our methodology for developing each of the assumptions used in the valuation model:\n\n",

The risk-free interest rate is based on the term structure of interest rates at the time of the option grant. The expected life represents an estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding, and we have relied upon a combination of the observed exercise behavior of our prior grants with similar characteristics, the vesting schedule of the grants and an index of peer companies with similar grant characteristics in estimating this variable. Expected volatilities are based on the historical returns on our stock and the implied volatility of our publicly-traded options.\n\nWe received cash of $16, $28 and $7 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from option holders resulting from the exercise of stock options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $16, $17 and $5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, there was $4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of three years and five months.\n\n## Discounted Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nWe maintain an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Under this plan, shares of UPS class A common stock may be purchased at quarterly intervals at 95% of the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock on the last day of each quarterly period. Employees purchased 0.6, 0.9 and 1.0 million shares at average prices of $172.07, $110.92 and $102.11 per share, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

      "question": "How do Caterpillar (CAT), FedEx (FDX), and 3M (MMM) each disclose their finance lease obligations in 2024, and what does this reveal about their differing capital structures and asset financing strategies?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar reports a net finance lease obligation of $103 million in 2024, indicating a relatively small role of lease financing in its long-term liabilities. FedEx, in contrast, shows a significantly higher finance lease obligation of $431 million in 2024, reflecting a more pronounced reliance on leasing for asset financing. 3M discloses a much smaller finance lease obligation of $47 million in 2024, suggesting a conservative approach to off-balance sheet financing through leases. Together, these figures reveal that while all three companies utilize finance leases, their scale and strategic emphasis vary, with FedEx more heavily leveraging leases than CAT or MMM.",

      "question": "How do GE, MMM, and UNP each reflect or respond to the role of expected return on assets in their pension obligations, and what does this reveal about their respective sensitivities and assumptions in managing long-term liabilities?",
      "answer": "GE discusses the expected return on assets as a key assumption in the actuarial valuation of its defined benefit pension plans, linking it to the broader framework of discount rates and compensation growth assumptions. MMM provides specific quantitative data, showing an expected return on assets of 7.63% for its U.S. pension plans in 2024, up from 7.50% in 2023, indicating a slightly optimistic outlook on asset performance. UNP, while not detailing its expected return assumptions, highlights a sensitivity analysis showing that a 0.25% decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by $12 million. Together, these perspectives reveal that while GE emphasizes the conceptual interplay of assumptions, MMM provides granular forward-looking expectations, and UNP focuses on the financial sensitivity of pension costs to asset return assumptions.",

Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including a discount rate, a compensation assumption, an expected return on assets, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement.\n\nProjected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected benefit payments. We discount those cash payments using a discount rate. We determine the discount rate using the weighted-average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits. Lower discount rates increase present values and generally increase subsequent-year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and generally reduce subsequent-year pension expense.\n\nThe compensation assumption is used to estimate the annual rate at which pay of plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase, as will the amount recorded in A OCI in our Statement of Financial Position and amortized into earnings in subsequent periods.",

      "answer": "Honeywell (HON) explicitly discloses its Consolidated Statement of Shareowners' Equity, indicating a transparent reporting structure. Raytheon (RTX) actively reduced Shareowners' Equity through a significant $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which was partially settled in cash due to stock price increases, impacting equity structure. UPS includes Shareowners' Equity as a detailed note (Note 12) in its financial statements, showing structured reporting but without specific equity-altering actions like share repurchases mentioned in RTX's disclosures. Together, these reveal differing approaches: HON emphasizes reporting clarity, RTX uses equity reduction strategically, and UPS maintains structured but less dynamic equity disclosure.",

As described in 'Note 16: G uarantees,' we extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal warranty and service policies for extended periods on some of our products. We have accrued our estimate of the liability that may result under these guarantees and for service costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nWe also have other commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs, and matters arising out of the normal course of business. We accrue contingencies based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount.\n\nIn  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  are  also  routinely  defendants  in,  parties  to,  or  otherwise  subject  to  many  pending  and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes, and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, regulatory, environmental, health and safety, employment, intellectual property, tax, and other laws. In some instances, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages, or non-monetary relief. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\n\n## NOTE 18: EQUITY\n\nCommon  Stock  -  Share  Repurchases. On  October  24,  2023,  we  entered  into  accelerated  share  repurchase  (ASR)  agreements  with  certain  financial  institution counterparties to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10 billion. The ASR agreements provided for the repurchase of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of such ASR agreements, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR agreements. Pursuant to the ASR agreements, we made aggregate payments of $10 billion on October  26,  2023,  and  received  initial  deliveries  of  approx imately 108.4  million  shares  of  our  common  stock  at  a  price  of  $78.38  per  share,  which,  on  that  date, represented  approximately  85%  of  the  shares  ex pected  to  be  repurchased.  The  aggregate  purchase  price  was  recorded  as  a  reduction  to  Shareowners'  equity, consisting of an $8.5 billion increase in Treasury stock and a $1.5 billion decrease in Common stock. We funded the payments with borrowings under a bridge credit agreement, which was repaid with the proceeds from term loan facilities, proceeds from issuances of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2023, and cash on hand. See 'Note 9: Borrowings and Lines of Credit' for additional information.\n\nThe shares associated with the remaining portion of the aggregate purchase price have been settled over two tranches. In July 2024, the first tranche was settled upon final delivery to us of 0.4 million shares of common stock. In September 2024, with respect to the second tranche, we owed 2.2 million shares of common stock that we elected to cash settle for $261 million. The cash payment required as a result of the second tranche settlement was due to the significant increase in the price of our common stock during the ASR term. The final average price under the ASR was $94.28 per share.\n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.

LMT\u2019s service sales totaled $10.2 billion, with services contributing alongside product sales in its overall cost structure. RTX reported $21.1 billion in service sales, accounting for 26% of its total net sales of $80.7 billion, showing a moderate emphasis on services.

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets that are to be held and used, an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment ex ists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value.\n\nWe operate integrated transportation networks so cash flows for most of our operating assets to be held and used are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level, for our analysis of impairment.\n\nIn 2024, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft and seven related engines to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $157 million ($120 million, net of tax , or $0.48 per diluted share) was recorded in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines for the same reasons stated above. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax , or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in 2023.\n\nIn the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. The criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion activities. At May 31, 2024, we had 19 aircraft temporarily idled. These aircraft have been idled for an average of eight months and are expected to return to revenue service.\n\nGOODWILL. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the ex pected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we proceed to test goodwill for impairment, including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value for our reporting units is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. Fair value determinations may include both internal and third-party valuations. Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter. See Note 4 for additional information.\n\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS . Intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, technology assets, and trademarks acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from 1 to 15 years, either on a straight-line basis or on a basis consistent with the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized. See Note 4 for additional information.\n\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS. Our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management's assumptions for discount rate, investment returns on plan assets, salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation ('PBO') could be effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that are designed to match our expected benefit payments in future years. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets ('EROA') for interim and segment reporting purposes. Our EROA is a judgmental estimate which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised as appropriate.\n\nThe accounting guidance related to employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of these plans. We use 'mark-to-market' (or 'MTM') accounting and immediately recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial gains or losses in our results annually in the fourth quarter each year. The annual MTM adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and does not impact segment results. The remaining",

      "answer": "CAT provides a detailed breakdown of its deferred tax assets, showing that its tax carryforwards amounted to $1,389 million in 2023, with a valuation allowance of $934 million against deferred tax assets, indicating some uncertainty in their realization. HON mentions the existence of tax carryforwards as part of its deferred tax assets but does not quantify them, suggesting a more general or less transparent approach to disclosing these items. RTX discusses the realizability of tax carryforwards in the context of future taxable income projections and notes that valuation allowances are adjusted based on changes in expectations, highlighting a forward-looking and judgment-based approach to managing these assets. Together, these disclosures reveal varying levels of specificity and strategic emphasis on the management and risk assessment of deferred tax assets across the three companies.",

      "answer": "FDX highlights that maintenance costs influence the evaluation of asset useful lives and salvage values, which directly affects depreciation expense and long-term asset valuation. GE notes that maintenance costs are tied to product quality and fleet availability, particularly in newer platforms like offshore wind turbines, where servicing challenges increase cost risks. RTX, while not directly mentioning maintenance costs, reveals that operational compliance with environmental and safety regulations, which often involve maintenance-related expenditures, can lead to significant liabilities and capital outlays. Together, these perspectives show that while FDX focuses on asset lifecycle and depreciation, GE emphasizes product performance and servicing risks, and RTX highlights regulatory-driven maintenance costs and compliance liabilities.",

      "answer": "General Dynamics' Aerospace segment revenue and operating earnings were directly tied to the volume and mix of aircraft deliveries and services performed, with fluctuations in volume significantly affecting both revenue and margins. Union Pacific reported an 11% year-over-year revenue increase to $20.2 billion, driven in part by a 4% rise in freight volume, showing a strong positive link between volume and revenue. In contrast, UPS experienced a decline in volume during the fourth quarter, which contributed to a moderation in expected revenue per piece growth in 2022. These differences highlight that while GD and UNP benefit from volume increases through higher production and freight movement respectively, UPS faces more volatility due to external demand shifts, particularly in e-commerce and global trade dynamics.",

          "chunk_text": "outfitted aircraft. Revenue associated with the segment's custom completions of narrow-body and wide-body aircraft and the segment's services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Fluctuations  in  revenue  from  period  to  period  result  from  the  number  and  mix  of  new  aircraft  deliveries, progress on aircraft completions, and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period.\n\nThe majority of the Aerospace segment's operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots, recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace segment's completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred.\n\nFor new aircraft, operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of ultra-large-cabin, large-cabin and midcabin aircraft deliveries. Aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft models. A new aircraft model typically has lower margins in its initial production lots, and then margins generally increase as  we  realize  efficiencies  in  the  production  process. Additional  factors  affecting  the  segment's  earnings  and margin include the volume, mix and profitability of completions and services work performed, the market for pre-owned  aircraft,  and  the  level  of  general  and  administrative  (G&amp;A)  and  net  research  and  development (R&amp;D) costs incurred by the segment.\n\nIn the defense segments, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized generally over time as the  work  progresses,  either  as  products  are  produced  or  as  services  are  rendered.  Typically,  revenue  is recognized  over  time  using  costs  incurred  to  date  relative  to  total  estimated  costs  at  completion  to  measure progress  toward  satisfying  our  performance  obligations.  Incurred  cost  represents  work  performed,  which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&amp;A expenses. Variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts. Because costs are used as a measure of progress, year-over-year variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volume.\n\nOperating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the  estimated  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  both.  Therefore,  changes  in  costs  incurred  in  the  period compared with  prior  periods  do  not  necessarily  impact  profitability.  It  is  only  when  total  estimated  costs  at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value (or vice versa) that the  profitability  of  that  contract  may  be  impacted.  Contract  mix  refers  to  changes  in  the  volume  of  higherversus lower-margin work. Higher or lower margins can result from a number of factors, including contract type (e.g.,  fixed-price/cost-reimbursable)  and  type  of  work  (e.g.,  development/production).  Contract  mix  can  also refer  to  the  stage  of  program  maturity  for  our  long-term  production  contracts.  New  long-term  production contracts  typically  have  lower  margins  initially,  and  then  margins  generally  increase  as  we  achieve  learning curve improvements or realize other cost reductions.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our three commodity groups. Freight revenues  vary  with  volume  (carloads)  and  ARC.  Changes  in  price,  traffic  mix,  and  fuel  surcharges  drive  ARC. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes,  are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. Customer  incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available  historical,  current,  and  forecasted  volumes,  and  recognized  as  the  related  performance  obligation  is satisfied. We recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue  between  reporting  periods  is  based  on  the  relative  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses recognized as incurred.\n\nOther subsidiary revenues (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses  recognized  as  incurred.  Accessorial  revenues  are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nOur freight revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $20.2 billion driven by a 4% increase in volume, higher fuel surcharge  revenue,  core  pricing  gains,  and  positive  mix  of  traffic  (for  example,  a  relative  increase  in  industrial shipments, which have a higher ARC). Volume increased in every key market segment compared to 2020 due to the recovery  from  the  depressed  economy  brought  on  by  the  COVID  pandemic  in  2020.  While  the  markets  have rebounded from 2020, our 2021 volume levels are 4% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOur  fuel  surcharge  programs  generated  freight  revenues  of  $1.7  billion  and  $1.0  billion  in  2021  and  2020, respectively. Fuel surcharge revenue in 2021 increased $0.7 billion as a result of a 49% increase in fuel price and a 4% increase in  carloadings,  partially  offset  by  the  lag  impact  on  fuel  surcharge  (it  can  generally  take  up  to  two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharges recoveries).\n\nIn 2021, other subsidiary revenues were flat with 2020 as the semiconductor shortage negatively impacting 2021 automotive  production  offset  the  recovery  from  other  COVID  related  declines  in  2020.  Accessorial  revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by increased intermodal accessorial charges tied to global supply chain disruptions. Other revenue was essentially flat year-over-year.",

          "chunk_text": "## UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Volume\n\nAverage daily volume increased for both domestic and export products, with growth primarily in the first half of the year. Volume declined in the fourth quarter, largely due to the year-over-year impacts of COVID-19 on consumer behavior. For the year, we experienced growth from both SMBs and large customers, primarily in the retail, manufacturing and technology sectors. Business-to-business volume increased 10.8% as commercial activity largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. Business-toconsumer volume increased 5.1%, with growth primarily in the first quarter when COVID-19 driven volume was not present in the comparative period. We expect overall volume growth to accelerate in 2022.\n\nExport volume increased for the year, led by Europe and the Americas, while Asia volume was largely unchanged. Volume growth was strongest on intra-Europe trade lanes, as well as from Europe and the Americas to the United States. Trade between Europe and the United Kingdom declined throughout the year as a result of Brexit, which became effective on January 1, 2021. Asia export volume grew significantly in the first quarter, but was then impacted in the second quarter by a reduction in shipments of personal protective equipment relative to 2020. Additionally, COVID-19 impacts within the region reduced the number of flights operated in the second half of the year.\n\nPremium products saw volume growth of 14.9%, driven by Worldwide Express and Transborder Express products. Volume for non-premium products increased 6.9%, driven by growth in our Transborder Standard product. Worldwide Standard volume increased primarily as a result of Brexit, with shipments between the United Kingdom and the European Union that are now subject to duties and taxes shifting from Transborder to Worldwide products.\n\nDomestic volume increased for the year in many markets, with the strongest growth in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, largely due to the impact of COVID-19 on business-to-consumer demand. During the fourth quarter, domestic volume declined, driven by a reduction in e-commerce resulting in fewer residential deliveries, that was slightly offset by growth in commercial volume.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nIn December 2020, we implemented an average 4.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the United States. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. In response to capacity constraints resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we began to apply demand-related surcharges on certain lanes in the second quarter of 2020. These surcharges are expected to remain elevated in 2022.\n\nTotal revenue per piece increased 14.4%, driven by changes in base pricing, fuel and demand-related surcharges and favorable shifts in customer and product mix. Currency movements contributed to the increase in revenue per piece for the year, but had a negative impact in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue per piece increased 12.0% for the year.\n\nExport revenue per piece increased 15.1% as a result of the factors described above. Excluding the impact of currency movements, export revenue per piece increased 13.2%.\n\nDomestic revenue per piece increased 9.9% due to changes in base pricing, fuel surcharges and customer and product mix. Although currency movements negatively impacted revenue per piece in the fourth quarter, they contributed to the increase in revenue per piece for the year. Excluding the impact of currency movements, revenue per piece increased 5.6%.\n\nWe expect revenue per piece growth to moderate in 2022.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nThe fuel surcharge for international air services originating inside or outside the U.S. is largely indexed to the DOE's Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. The fuel surcharges for ground services originating outside the U.S. are indexed to fuel prices in the region or country where the shipment originates.\n\nWhile fluctuations can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our market pricing strategy that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price and extra service charges and any pricing discounts offered. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $866 million, primarily due to increases in fuel surcharge indices, as well as overall volume growth and changes in customer and product mix.",

      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) focuses on long-term pension asset value preservation through diversified investments in equities, bonds, and real assets, with regular rebalancing to target allocations. FedEx (FDX) actively adjusts aircraft asset values based on utilization, retirement decisions, and impairment charges\u2014recording $157 million in noncash impairments in 2024 due to fleet modernization. Union Pacific (UNP) estimates asset value based on usage metrics like gross ton-miles for rail, adjusting depreciation rates annually and capitalizing costs that extend asset life or improve efficiency. Together, these companies show distinct approaches: EMR emphasizes asset allocation discipline, FDX focuses on dynamic asset retirement and impairment, and UNP uses usage-based depreciation and capitalization of improvement costs.",

FedEx reported a 77% increase in fuel expense due to higher prices, though fuel surcharges helped offset some of the impact, resulting in a net benefit to operating income. UPS noted a $1.2 billion increase in international network costs driven by higher fuel prices and volume growth, with fuel contracts indexed to market prices amplifying earnings volatility. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are sensitive to fuel price volatility, FedEx and UPS experienced direct cost increases that were partially mitigated by surcharge mechanisms, whereas Boeing faced more indirect demand-side risks through airline customer behavior.",

In addition, we have experienced claims and  assertions  from  customers  in  connection  with  the  grounding  and  associated  delivery  delays,  and  recorded  an estimate  of  potential  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  customers  for  these  disruptions. As  of  December  31, 2021, the remaining liability associated with these concessions and other considerations totaled $2.9 billion, of which $0.7 billion remains subject to negotiation.\n\nAny further delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX in one or more jurisdictions, further disruptions to suppliers and/or  the  long-term  health  of  the  production  system,  supplier  claims  or  assertions,  or  changes  to  estimated concessions or other considerations we expect to provide to customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. In the event of unanticipated additional training requirements in one or more jurisdictions, delays in regulatory approval and/or delays in our ability to resume deliveries to one or more  customers,  we  may  be  required  to  take  actions  with  longer-term  impact,  such  as  further  changes  to  our production plans, employment reductions and/or the expenditure of significant resources to support our supply chain and/or customers.\n\nWe have made significant estimates with respect to the 737 program regarding the number of units to be produced, the period  during  which  those  units  are  likely  to  be  produced,  and  the  units'  expected  sales  prices,  production  costs, program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs,  and  routine  warranty  costs.  We  have  made  assumptions  regarding outcomes of accident investigations and other government inquiries, timing of future 737 production rate increases, timing  and  sequence  of  future  deliveries,  supply  chain  health  as  we  implement  our  production  plans,  as  well  as outcomes of negotiations with customers. Any changes in these estimates and/or assumptions with respect to the 737 program could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## In  addition  to  the  impact  of  COVID-19  described  above,  our  Commercial  Airplanes  and  Global  Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.\n\nMarket  conditions  have  a  significant  impact  on  demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  and  related  services. The commercial  aircraft  market  is  predominantly  driven  by  long-term  trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  are  sustained  economic  growth  and  political  stability  both  in developed  and  emerging  markets.  Demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  is  further  influenced  by  airline  profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower  revenues,  profitability  and  cash  flows  and  a  reduction  in  our  contractual  backlog.  In  addition,  because  our commercial  aircraft  backlog  consists  of  aircraft  scheduled  for  delivery  over  a  period  of  several  years,  any  of  these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\n\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations  between  the  contract  date  and  delivery  date,  aircraft  pricing  generally  consists  of  a  fixed  amount  as modified by price escalation formulas",

          "chunk_text": "The challenging labor market and inflationary pressures contributed to increases in purchased transportation, salaries and employee benefits, and other operating expenses in 2022. Higher fuel surcharges also contributed to increased purchased transportation costs. Salaries and employee benefits expense also increased in 2022 due to merit increases, partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation expense. Higher self-insurance accruals, increased costs related to information technology expenses, a charge related to pre- and post-judgment interest in connection with a FedEx Ground legal matter, and additional volume-related expenses also contributed to an increase in other operating expense in 2022. Rentals and landing fees increased in 2022 primarily driven by increased vehicle and aircraft leases at FedEx Express, as well as network expansion at FedEx Ground.\n\n## Fuel\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our air and ground services, most of which are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Some FedEx Express international fuel surcharges incorporate a timing lag of approximately six to eight weeks. We routinely review our fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments. The net impact of fuel on operating income described below and for each segment below does not include the impact from these ordinary-course table changes.\n\nWhile fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price, and extra service charges we obtain for these services and level of pricing discounts offered.\n\nIn order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharges on the trend in revenue and yield growth, we have included the comparative weighted-average fuel surcharge percentages in effect for 2022 and 2021 in the accompanying discussions of each of our transportation segments.\n\nFuel expense increased 77% during 2022 due to higher fuel prices. In addition to variability in usage and market prices, the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of fuel on our results. For example, our contracts for jet fuel purchases at FedEx Express are tied to various indices, including the U.S. Gulf Coast index. While many of these indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for jet fuel. Furthermore, under these contractual arrangements, approximately 70% of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week, with the remainder of our purchases tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day, rather than based on daily spot rates. These contractual provisions mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rates on our jet fuel purchases.\n\nBecause of the factors described above, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term. For more information, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\nThe net impact of fuel had a significant benefit to operating income in 2022 as higher fuel surcharges outpaced increased fuel prices. The net impact of fuel on our operating results does not consider the effects that fuel surcharge levels may have on our business, including changes in demand and shifts in the mix of services purchased by our customers. In addition, our purchased transportation expense is impacted by fuel costs.\n\n## Other Income and Expense\n\nInterest expense decreased $104 million in 2022 primarily due to the 2021 debt extinguishment transactions further discussed in the 'Liquidity' section of this MD&amp;A and Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During 2021, we issued $3.25 billion of senior unsecured debt under our shelf registration statement and used the net proceeds to redeem outstanding debt. In connection with our debt restructuring, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $393 million ($297 million, net of tax, or $1.11 per diluted share) in 2021. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\n## Retirement Plans MTM Adjustments\n\nIn 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM loss of $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share), which includes a net loss of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion, net of tax, or $3.76 per diluted share) related to the year-end actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans' assets and liabilities. These actuarial adjustments were due to lower than expected asset returns, demographic experience, and an update to the mortality assumption, partially offset by higher discount rates.\n\nIn addition, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash MTM net loss of $260 million ($195 million, net of tax, or $0.73 per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2022, of which $224 million was related to the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands Pension Plan. Effective October 1, 2021, the responsibility of all pension assets and liabilities of this plan was transferred to a separate, multiemployer pension plan. The remaining $36 million net loss was related to the U.S. FedEx Freight Pension Plan and consisted of a $75 million MTM loss due to a lower discount rate in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by a $39 million curtailment gain.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses, and operating expenses excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, increased. The costs of operating our integrated international air and ground network increased $1.2 billion driven by the impact of higher fuel prices and volume growth. We expect these trends to continue in 2022.\n\nIn addition to variability in usage and market prices, the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of costs on our results. The majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize index-based pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locational/supplier differential. While many of the indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for fuel. Because of this, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term.\n\nPickup and delivery costs increased $718 million, primarily due to volume growth that drove additional third-party transportation expense. Package sorting costs increased $198 million, also as a result of overall volume growth. We anticipate that these operating expenses may continue to increase due to volume growth and external market factors, such as fuel prices and inflation.\n\nThe remaining increase in operating expenses was due to increases in other indirect operating costs.\n\n## Operating Profit and Margin\n\nAs a result of the factors described above, operating profit increased $1.2 billion, with operating margin increasing 230 basis points to 23.8%. Excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, adjusted operating profit also increased $1.2 billion, with operating margin increasing 200 basis points to 24.2%.",

      "question": "How do Boeing (BA), Honeywell (HON), and Union Pacific (UNP) compare in terms of the aggregate intrinsic value of their outstanding stock options, and what does this reveal about the relative market valuation impact of their equity compensation programs?",
      "answer": "Boeing reports an aggregate intrinsic value of $0 for its outstanding options at the end of the year, indicating that its stock price was below the weighted average exercise price of those options. Honeywell reports an aggregate intrinsic value of $576 million for its outstanding options, showing that its stock price was above a significant portion of its exercise prices. Union Pacific reports an aggregate intrinsic value of $74 million for its outstanding options, reflecting a modest positive valuation impact. This comparison reveals that Honeywell\u2019s equity compensation program is currently more valuable on paper, while Boeing\u2019s options are entirely out-of-the-money, and Union Pacific\u2019s are slightly in-the-money, suggesting differing market perceptions of each company\u2019s stock performance and future outlook.",

        "Hop 1: BA \u2192 Options Outstanding: Boeing reports that its outstanding options have an aggregate intrinsic value of $0, indicating that the stock price is below the average exercise price of $245.76.",
        "Hop 2: HON \u2192 Options Outstanding: Honeywell reports an aggregate intrinsic value of $576 million for its outstanding options, showing that its stock price exceeds many of the exercise prices across different ranges.",
        "Hop 3: UNP \u2192 Options Outstanding: Union Pacific reports an aggregate intrinsic value of $74 million for its outstanding options, indicating a modest in-the-money position relative to its weighted average exercise price of $195.81."

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing (BA) highlighted that material costs are a key component in its program cost estimates, which directly affect gross profit margins\u2014specifically noting that a 1% change in gross margin across its commercial airplane programs would impact operating earnings by approximately $330 million. General Dynamics (GD) indicated that material costs are part of the contract cost structure that influences progress-based revenue recognition and profitability adjustments, particularly on long-term defense contracts. Honeywell (HON) reported that material costs increased by approximately $0.8 billion year-over-year, contributing to a rise in cost of products sold, though partially offset by productivity gains of $0.3 billion. Together, these disclosures show that all three companies faced upward pressure on material costs, but each experienced and managed the impact differently\u2014BA through sensitivity in margin estimation, GD through contract cost-performance dynamics, and HON through cost increases offset by internal productivity initiatives.",

Honeywell noted that rising material costs offset some of the gains from higher sales volumes and favorable pricing, constraining segment profit growth. Union Pacific, while not directly mentioning material costs, revealed that it capitalizes significant material and labor costs into its $54.871 billion property, plant, and equipment base, indicating that material cost increases would directly affect its capital expenditures and asset valuation. Together, these perspectives show that material cost increases had a direct negative impact on profitability for Caterpillar and Honeywell, while for Union Pacific, the effect was more structural, influencing long-term asset base and capital spending.",

Caterpillar management utilizes  these  charts  internally  to  visually  communicate  with  the  company's  Board  of  Directors  and  employees.  The  bar  entitled  Other  includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation other operating (income) expenses .\n\nOperating profit was $6.878 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.325 billion, or 51 percent, compared with $4.553 billion in 2020. The increase was due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization, higher profit from Financial Products and lower restructuring expenses (included in other), partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable  manufacturing  costs reflected increased freight and higher material costs. In addition, unfavorable period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, and higher labor costs. Unfavorable period manufacturing costs were mostly offset by favorable cost absorption and lower warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased more during 2021 than during 2020.\n\nHigher  SG&amp;A/R&amp;D  expenses  reflected  higher  short-term  incentive  compensation  expense  and  investments  aligned  with  the company's strategy for profitable growth, including higher labor costs and acquisition-related expenses.\n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to no short-term incentive compensation expense recognized in 2020. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. For 2022, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $1.0 billion.\n\nOperating profit margin was 13.5 percent in 2021, compared with 10.9 percent in 2020.\n\n",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  (PCAOB),  the  Corporation's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2021,  based  on criteria  established  in Internal  Control -Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  and  our  report  dated  February  4,  2022,  expressed  an  unqualified opinion on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud.  Our  audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included  evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe  critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current-period  audit  of  the  financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Capitalization of Properties -Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe  Corporation's  operations  are  highly  capital  intensive  and  their  large  network  of  assets  turns  over  on  a continuous basis. Each year, the Corporation develops a capital program for both the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of new assets. In determining whether costs should be capitalized, the Corporation exercises significant judgment in determining whether expenditures meet the applicable minimum units of property criteria and extend the useful life, improve the safety of operations, or improve the operating efficiency of existing assets. The Corporation capitalizes all costs of capital projects necessary to make assets ready for their intended use and because a portion of the Corporation's assets are self-constructed, management also exercises significant judgment  in  determining  the  amount  of  material,  labor,  work  equipment,  and  indirect  costs  that  qualify  for capitalization. Properties, net were $54,871 million as of December 31, 2021 and, during 2021, the Corporation's capital investments were $2.9 billion.\n\nWe identified the capitalization of property as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment exercised by management in determining whether costs meet the criteria for capitalization. This, in turn, required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the criteria to capitalize costs were met and to evaluate sufficiency of audit evidence to support management's conclusions.",

For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair v alue net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair v alue at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. T he expense is recognized ov er the requisite serv ice period, which is generally the v esting period of the award.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nProvisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Loss before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulativ e effect of any changes in tax rates from those used prev iously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such prov isions differ from the amounts currently receiv able or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax prov isions and evaluating tax positions.\n\nThe accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. T o the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. T ax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax benefit/(expense).\n\nWe also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recov er our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a v aluation allowance if, based on the av ailable ev idence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.  Changes in our estimates and judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets may result in an increase or decrease to our tax expense and/or other comprehensiv e income, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.\n\n## Postretirement Plans\n\nMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. The majority of employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans hav e transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement sav ings plan. We also prov ide postretirement benefit plans other than  pensions,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  cov erage  to  eligible  retirees  and  qualifying  dependents.  Benefits  under  the  pension  and  other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of serv ice and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee's annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return and medical trend (rate of growth  for  medical  costs).  Actuarial  gains  and  losses,  which  occur  when  actual  experience  differs  from  actuarial  assumptions,  are  reflected  in Shareholders' equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, we amortize them over the av erage expected future lifetime of participants.  T he funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the  Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## Postemployment Plans\n\nWe record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as sev erance or job training, when payment is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.",

If the rate of growth assumed increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase, as will the amount recorded in AOCI in our Statement of Financial Position and amortized into earnings in subsequent periods.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the benefit obligations. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider our asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. In developing future long-term return expectations for our principal benefit plans' assets, we formulate views on the future economic environment, both in the U.S. and abroad. We evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields and spreads, using both internal and external sources. We also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given our asset allocation. Based on our analysis, we have assumed a 6.25% long-term expected return on the GE Pension Plan assets for cost recognition in 2021 and 2020, as compared to 6.75% in 2019. For 2022 cost recognition, we have assumed a 6.00% long-term expected return for the GE Pension Plan assets.\n\nThe Society of Actuaries issued new mortality improvement tables in 2021 and 2020. We updated mortality assumptions in the U.S. accordingly. These changes in assumptions increased the December 31, 2021 U.S. pension and retiree benefit plans' obligations by $278 million and decreased the December 31, 2020 obligations by $180 million.\n\nThe healthcare trend assumptions primarily apply to our pre-65 retiree medical plans. Most participants in our post-65 retiree plan have a fixed subsidy and therefore are not subject to healthcare inflation.\n\nWe evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographics factors such as retirement age and turnover, and update them to reflect our actual experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. Differences between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income each period. These differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active participating employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable. For the principal pension plans, gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method with a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. For most other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line or a corridor amortization method.\n\nSENSITIVITIES TO KEY ASSUMPTIONS. Fluctuations in discount rates can significantly impact pension cost and obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would increase principal pension plan cost in the following year by about $205 million and would increase the principal pension plan projected benefit obligation at year-end by about $2,300 million. The deficit sensitivity to the discount rate is lower than the projected benefit obligation sensitivity as a result of the liability hedging program incorporated in the plan's asset allocation. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase principal pension plan cost in the following year by about $260 million.\n\nTHE COMPOSITION OF OUR PLAN ASSETS. The fair value of our pension plans' investments is presented below. The inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of these assets are described in Note 1 and have been applied consistently.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, Emerson (EMR) reported current operating lease liabilities of $144 million, FedEx (FDX) reported $2,463 million, and Raytheon (RTX) reported $348 million. This reveals that FedEx has significantly higher short-term lease exposure compared to Emerson and Raytheon, suggesting a more asset-intensive operational model or greater reliance on leased facilities and equipment. Emerson\u2019s lower liability indicates a relatively lighter lease burden, while Raytheon\u2019s liability sits between the two, reflecting a moderate exposure to near-term lease obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation - Aearo Technologies: On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies ('Aearo'). Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products. Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo's respirator business (American Optical Corporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation ('Cabot')) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $51 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related and coal mine dust claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the 'Payor Group'). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the 'AO Safety' brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo's share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving ex posure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo's potential liability is limited to ex posures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be ex posed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995, period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\n\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor G roup including ex haustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix ) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo's share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for ex isting and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued. Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo's liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\n\nEnvironmental Matters and Litigation: The Company's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic or hazardous substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, which are enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and many for which private parties in the United States and abroad may have rights of action. These laws and regulations can form the basis of, under certain circumstances, claims for the investigation and remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of and/or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damages. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital ex penditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury, natural resource, and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.\n\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\") and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where hazardous substances have been released or disposed of. The Company has identified numerous locations, many of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability for remediation of contamination under applicable environmental laws. Please refer to the section entitled ' Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Recovery ' that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.",

These  primarily  relate  to  environmental  liabilities,  which  are  included  in  our  total  environmental  liabilities  as  further  discussed  in  'Note  17: Commitments and Contingencies.'\n\nWe accrue for costs associated with guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued.\n\nWe also provide service and warranty policies on our products and extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines.  In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance issues. Liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees are based upon future product performance and durability, and are largely estimated based upon historical experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claims data and historical experience warrant.\n\nThe changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties and product performance guarantees for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Boeing reported 84,633 shareholders of record as of January 24, 2024, indicating a relatively broad ownership base. Caterpillar had 21,217 shareholders at the end of 2023, showing a smaller but still institutional-level shareholder base, which slightly declined from 21,935 in 2022. UPS, on the other hand, has a bifurcated share structure with class A and class B shares, with 157,276 and 19,971 shareholders of record respectively as of February 2, 2024, suggesting a unique ownership structure that may influence investor participation and voting rights.

For example, we tested the internal controls over management's review of the defined benefit pension obligation calculations, the significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided to the actuaries. To test the defined benefit pension obligation, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating  the  methodology  used,  the  significant  actuarial  assumptions  described  above  and  the  underlying  data  used  by  the Corporation.  We  compared  the  actuarial  assumptions  used  by  management  to  historical  trends  and  evaluated  the  change  in  the defined benefit pension obligation from prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, benefit payments, settlements, actuarial gains and losses, longevity assumptions and plan amendments. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating  management's  methodology  for  determining  the  discount  rate  that  considers  the  maturity  and  duration  of  the  benefit payments and is used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to the prior year and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. Lastly, we also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to the Corporation's actuarial specialists.\n\n## /s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1994.\n\nTysons, Virginia January 28, 2025",

The annual measurement date is December 31. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fix ed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. Changes in expected benefit payment and service cost cash flows, as well as ongoing changes in market activity and yields, cause these rates to be subject to uncertainty.\n\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n\n",

For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair v alue net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair v alue at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. T he expense is recognized ov er the requisite serv ice period, which is generally the v esting period of the award.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nProvisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Loss before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulativ e effect of any changes in tax rates from those used prev iously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such prov isions differ from the amounts currently receiv able or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax prov isions and evaluating tax positions.\n\nThe accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. T o the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. T ax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax benefit/(expense).\n\nWe also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recov er our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a v aluation allowance if, based on the av ailable ev idence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.  Changes in our estimates and judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets may result in an increase or decrease to our tax expense and/or other comprehensiv e income, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.\n\n## Postretirement Plans\n\nMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. The majority of employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans hav e transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement sav ings plan. We also prov ide postretirement benefit plans other than  pensions,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  cov erage  to  eligible  retirees  and  qualifying  dependents.  Benefits  under  the  pension  and  other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of serv ice and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee's annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return and medical trend (rate of growth  for  medical  costs).  Actuarial  gains  and  losses,  which  occur  when  actual  experience  differs  from  actuarial  assumptions,  are  reflected  in Shareholders' equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, we amortize them over the av erage expected future lifetime of participants.  T he funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the  Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## Postemployment Plans\n\nWe record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as sev erance or job training, when payment is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.",

For example, we tested the internal controls over management's review of the defined benefit pension obligation calculations, the significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided to the actuaries. To test the defined benefit pension obligation, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating  the  methodology  used,  the  significant  actuarial  assumptions  described  above  and  the  underlying  data  used  by  the Corporation.  We  compared  the  actuarial  assumptions  used  by  management  to  historical  trends  and  evaluated  the  change  in  the defined benefit pension obligation from prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, benefit payments, settlements, actuarial gains and losses, longevity assumptions and plan amendments. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating  management's  methodology  for  determining  the  discount  rate  that  considers  the  maturity  and  duration  of  the  benefit payments and is used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to the prior year and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. Lastly, we also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to the Corporation's actuarial specialists.\n\n## /s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1994.\n\nTysons, Virginia January 28, 2025",

          "chunk_text": "## Postretirement Plans\n\nMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement  savings  plan  in  2016.  Additional  union  employees  transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee's annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of the service cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and  reflected  in  inventory  at  the  end  of  a  reporting  period.  Actuarial  gains  and  losses,  which  occur  when  actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders' equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, we amortize them over the average expected future  lifetime  of  participants.  The  funded  status  of  our  pension  and  postretirement  plans  is  reflected  on  the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## Postemployment Plans\n\nWe record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.\n\n## Environmental Remediation\n\nWe are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,  obligations  and  commitments  for  remediation  of  contaminated  sites, including  assessments  of  ranges  and  probabilities  of  recoveries  from  other  responsible  parties  and/or  insurance carriers.  Our  policy  is  to  accrue  and  charge  to  current  expense  identified  exposures  related  to  environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value  as  the  timing  of  payments  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated.  We  may  be  able  to  recover  a  portion  of  the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $47 and $74 at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe",

Capitalized interest was $121 and $118 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWe monitor our property, plant and equipment for any indicators that the carrying value of our asset groups may not be recoverable, at which time we review the asset group for impairment based on undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as appropriate. We test long-lived assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified. We evaluate long-lived assets within our global small package operations at a network level given the cash flows associated with individual assets therein are not independent. Refer to note 4 for a discussion of impairments of property, plant and equipment.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, we entered into an agreement in principle with our largest customer that will provide for a significant reduction in their volume. In connection therewith, we will be reconfiguring our U.S. network and expect this reconfiguration to lead to a reduction in the number of buildings, vehicles and aircraft in our network. We are not yet able to identify the specific assets which will be impacted by these actions; however, it is reasonably possible that revisions to our estimates of the useful life and salvage values of certain of our long-lived assets will accelerate depreciation ex pense and charges related to early retirements may be recognized during future periods.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease obligation for all leases greater than twelve months, including reasonably certain renewal or purchase options. Some of our leases contain both lease and non-lease components, which we have elected to treat as a single lease component. Lease costs for short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nCertain of our leases contain future payments that are dependent on an index or rate, such as the consumer price index. We initially measure the lease obligation and ROU asset using the index or rate at the commencement date. In subsequent periods, lease payments dependent on an index or rate are not remeasured. Rather, changes to payments due to a change in an index or rate are recognized in our statements of consolidated income in the period of the change.\n\nWhen available, we use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments; however, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for substantially all of our leases. For these leases, we use an estimate of our incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The incremental borrowing rate is derived using multiple inputs including our credit rating, the impact of full collateralization, lease term and denominated currency.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nCosts of purchased businesses in excess of net identifiable assets acquired (goodwill) and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, unless changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred between annual tests. We complete our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of July 1 on a reporting unit basis.\n\nIn assessing goodwill for impairment, we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We consider several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, changes in management, strategy or customers and relevant reporting unit-specific events such as a change in the carrying amount of net assets, a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing of all, or a portion of, a reporting unit, and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. If this qualitative assessment results in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit ex ceeds the carrying value, then no further testing is performed for that reporting unit.\n\nIf the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, or if we elect to bypass the qualitative test, we quantitatively assess the fair value of a reporting unit to test goodwill for impairment. We assess the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow modeling and observable valuation multiples for comparable companies. Our estimates are developed using assumptions that we believe are consistent with how a market participant would value our reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit ex ceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we record the ex cess amount as goodwill impairment, not to ex ceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.",

The balance of accrued interest and penalties was $55 million on May 31, 2022 and $61 million on May 31, 2021. Our consolidated statements of income for 2021 include $20 million of interest expense associated with our uncertain tax positions while interest and penalty expense for 2022 and 2020 are immaterial.\n\nIt is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions. Changes may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits, appeals, or litigation in state, local, federal, and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the resolution of various proceedings between U.S. and foreign tax authorities. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months. However, estimates of the amounts or ranges for individual matters where a material change is reasonably possible cannot be made.

For example, we tested the internal controls over management's review of the defined benefit pension  obligation  calculations,  the  significant  actuarial  assumptions  and  the  data  inputs  provided  to  the actuaries.\n\nTo test the defined benefit pension obligation, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used, the significant actuarial assumptions described above and the underlying data used by the Corporation. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends and evaluated the  change  in  the  defined  benefit  pension  obligation  from  prior  year  due  to  the  change  in  service  cost, interest cost, benefit payments, settlements, actuarial gains and losses, new longevity assumptions and plan amendments.  In  addition,  we  involved  our  actuarial  specialists  to  assist  in  evaluating  management's methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to the prior year and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash  flows.  To  evaluate  longevity,  we  evaluated  management's  selection  of  mortality  base  tables  and improvement  scales,  adjusted  for  entity-specific  factors.

The  bar  entitled  Other  includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation other operating (income) expenses .\n\nOperating profit was $6.878 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.325 billion, or 51 percent, compared with $4.553 billion in 2020. The increase was due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization, higher profit from Financial Products and lower restructuring expenses (included in other), partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable  manufacturing  costs reflected increased freight and higher material costs. In addition, unfavorable period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, and higher labor costs. Unfavorable period manufacturing costs were mostly offset by favorable cost absorption and lower warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased more during 2021 than during 2020.\n\nHigher  SG&amp;A/R&amp;D  expenses  reflected  higher  short-term  incentive  compensation  expense  and  investments  aligned  with  the company's strategy for profitable growth, including higher labor costs and acquisition-related expenses.\n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to no short-term incentive compensation expense recognized in 2020. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. For 2022, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $1.0 billion.\n\nOperating profit margin was 13.5 percent in 2021, compared with 10.9 percent in 2020.\n\n",

We  could  incur  significant  costs  to  improve  the  climate  resiliency  of  our infrastructure and supply chain and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate the effects of climate change. In addition, under certain classified fixed price development and production contracts we are unable to insure risk of loss to government property because of the classified nature of the contracts and the inability to disclose classified information necessary for underwriting and claims to commercial insurers. Even if insurance coverage is available, we may not be able to obtain it in an amount, at a price or on terms acceptable to us.

Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products or services, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It also could affect the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.\n\n## Environmental costs and regulation, including in response to climate change, could adversely affect our future earnings as well as the affordability of our products and services.\n\nWe are  subject  to  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  requirements  for  the  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to the complexity and pervasiveness of these requirements, we are a party to or have property subject to various lawsuits, proceedings, and remediation obligations. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We have incurred and will continue to incur liabilities for environmental remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party-owned sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party as a result of our historical activities and those of our predecessor companies. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, and the extent  of  financial  exposure  can  be  difficult  to  estimate.  Among  the  variables  management  must  assess  in  evaluating  costs associated with these cases and remediation sites are the status of site assessment, extent of the contamination, impacts on natural resources,  changing  cost  estimates,  evolution  of  technologies  used  to  remediate  the  site,  continually  evolving  environmental standards, availability of insurance coverage and indemnification under existing agreements and cost allowability issues, including varying  efforts  by  the  U.S.  Government  to  limit  allowability  of  our  costs  in  resolving  liability  at  third-party-owned  sites.  Our environmental  remediation  related  liabilities  could  also  significantly  increase  because  of  acquisitions,  the  regulation  of  new substances, stricter remediation standards for existing regulated substances, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws  and  regulations,  or  the  discovery  of  previously  unknown  or  more  extensive  contamination  or  new  contaminants.  For information  regarding  these  matters,  including  current  estimates  of  the  amounts  that  we  believe  are  required  for  environmental remediation to the extent probable and estimable, see 'Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters' in the MD&amp;A and 'Note 15 - Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe manage and have managed various U.S. Government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. Government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs historically have been the responsibility of the U.S. Government. We have relied, and continue to rely with respect to past practices, on U.S. Government funding to pay such costs, notwithstanding efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit this responsibility. Although the U.S. Government remains responsible for capital and operating  costs  associated  with  environmental  compliance,  responsibility  for  fines  and  penalties  associated  with  environmental noncompliance typically is borne by either the U.S. Government or the contractor, depending on the contract and the relevant facts. Some environmental laws include criminal provisions. A conviction under environmental law could affect our ability to be awarded future or perform under existing U.S. Government contracts.\n\nThe increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change could result in laws, regulations or policies that significantly increase our direct and indirect operational and compliance burdens, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. These laws, regulations or policies could take  many  forms,  including  carbon  taxes,  cap  and  trade  regimes,  increased  efficiency  standards,  GHG  reduction  commitments, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy or changes in procurement laws. Changes in government procurement laws that mandate or take into account climate change considerations, such as the contractor's GHG emissions, lower emission products or other climate risks, in evaluating bids could result in costly changes to our operations or affect our competitiveness on future bids.

In connection with the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - 'Risk Factors,' which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement the Company's financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain 'non-GAAP financial measures,' as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management's control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the Company's financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nUnderlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure: net sales ).\n\nOperating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings",

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\n\nWe have two reportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. Global small package operations represent our most significant business and are broken down into regional operations around the world. Regional operations managers are responsible for both domestic and export products within their geographic area. Supply Chain Solutions comprises the results of non-reportable operating segments that do not meet the quantitative and qualitative criteria of a reportable segment as defined under ASC Topic 280 - Segment Reporting.\n\n## U.S. Domestic Package\n\nU.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents and packages throughout the United States.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide, including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or destination outside the United States. Our International Package reporting segment includes our operations in Europe, Asia, Americas and ISMEA.\n\n## Supply Chain Solutions\n\nSupply Chain Solutions includes our Forwarding, Logistics, Coyote, Marken, UPS Mail Innovations and other businesses. Our Forwarding, Logistics and UPS Mail Innovations units provide services in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide and include international air and ocean freight forwarding, customs brokerage, distribution and post-sales services, mail and consulting services. Coyote offers truckload brokerage services primarily in the United States. Marken is a global provider of supply chain solutions to the healthcare and life sciences industry, specializing in clinical trials logistics. Other businesses within this segment include The UPS Store, UPS Capital and Roadie. This segment also included UPS Freight prior to its divestiture, details of which are set out in note 4.\n\nIn evaluating financial performance, we focus on operating profit as a segment's measure of profit or loss. Operating profit is before investment income (expense) and other, interest expense and income tax expense. Certain expenses are allocated between the segments using activity-based costing methods as described in Part I, \"Item 7. Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. As we operate an integrated, global multimodal network, we evaluate many of our capital expenditure decisions at a network level. Accordingly, expenditures on property, plant and equipment by segment are not presented. Unallocated assets are comprised primarily of cash and marketable securities.",

      "answer": "FDX reported $9,832 million in cash provided by operating activities in 2022, a slight decrease from $10,135 million in 2021, indicating stable cash flow generation despite a drop in net income. UNP generated $9,032 million in 2021 (no 2022 data available), maintaining a high cash flow conversion rate of 93% relative to net income, suggesting efficient operations. UPS, while not providing a direct 2022 figure, highlighted that cash from operating activities is a primary source for financing domestic needs, including capital expenditures and dividends, and held $3.1 billion in foreign cash as of 2021, indicating global liquidity flexibility.

Amounts due to suppliers that participate in the SCF program may be reflected in cash flows from operating activities or cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business. Cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases, pension contributions and dividend payments to shareowners. All cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the U.S. without any U.S. federal income taxes.

Honeywell shows a net amount recognized of $1,184 million for U.S. pension plans and $440 million for non-U.S. plans, suggesting a more favorable funded status. Lockheed Martin discloses a net amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $327 million for retiree medical and life insurance plans, reflecting a smaller burden relative to pension obligations.

      "answer": "EMR notes that supply chain disruptions, including those from geopolitical conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war, could delay shipments and lead to loss of customers and revenue, particularly given their global manufacturing footprint and reliance on international suppliers. GE highlights that customer commitments for its Haliade-X offshore wind turbines span Europe, North America, and Asia, but rising inflationary costs and supply chain challenges are impacting its ability to meet those commitments efficiently. RTX reports that supply chain disruptions, including those from the ongoing effects of the pandemic, could materially affect its ability to meet customer commitments, especially given its reliance on single-source suppliers and defense-specific procurement constraints. Collectively, these perspectives show that while all three companies face exposure to customer commitments, their strategic vulnerabilities differ based on geographic exposure, supplier dependency, and industry-specific regulatory and operational constraints.",

          "chunk_text": "Further, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial or other benefits of the planned sale. Moreover, after the transaction is completed, the Company will be smaller and less diversified, with a narrower business focus, including a focus on software, innovation and disruptive technologies, and may encounter more volatility and be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could adversely affect our business. We also may not be able to redeploy the net proceeds from our divestitures on the timing or with the benefits anticipated.\n\nWe Use a Variety of Raw Materials and Components in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products\n\nOur major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, electronics, rare earth metals, aluminum, brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. The Company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters, a health epidemic or pandemic, or other events. Significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur Operations Depend on Production Facilities Throughout the World, a Majority of Which Are Located Outside the United States and Subject to Increased Risks of Disrupted Production, Causing Delays in Shipments and Loss of Customers and Revenue\n\nWe manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority of which are located outside the United States, and also source certain materials globally. Emerging market sales represent over one-third of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a best-cost position. Our and our suppliers' non-U.S. production facilities and operations could be disrupted by weather and natural disaster (including the potential effects of climate change), labor strife, war (including the Russia-Ukraine conflict), political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns such as an epidemic or pandemic, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences.\n\nOur manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws, policies and regulations in host countries, as well as economic and political upheaval, than our domestic facilities. These facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us.\n\nAccess to Funding Through the Capital Markets is Essential to the Execution of Our Business Plan, and if We Are Unable to Maintain Such Access We Could Experience a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Financial Results\n\nOur ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. Volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments, or affect the Company's ability to access those markets. If we are unable to continue to access the capital markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if our customers, suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the Company, our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur Business Success Depends on the Ability to Attract, Develop and Retain Key Personnel\n\nOur success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. The failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to succeed in our human capital goals and priorities as well as negatively impact our business and operating results.",

While many factors, including government incentives and specific market rules, affect how renewable energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region, renewable energy has become competitive with fossil fuels in terms of levelized cost of electricity. We continue to invest in generating wind turbine product improvements, including larger rotors, taller towers and higher nameplate ratings that continue to drive down the cost of onshore and offshore wind energy, to develop more efficient production processes for key components and to explore ways to further improve the efficiency and flexibility of our hydropower technology with new innovative turbine designs and digital solutions. As industry models continue to evolve, our digital strategy and investments in technical innovation will position us to add value for customers looking for clean, renewable energy.\n\nSignificant Trends &amp; Developments. While we continue to expect long term growth in U.S onshore wind, the expiry of U.S. Production Tax Credits (PTC) in 2021 has created uncertainty resulting in project delays and deferral of customer investments. We are monitoring policy proposals where a strong and diverse interest in tax credits promoting new wind generation continues to exist. The latest Wood Mackenzie equipment and repower forecast expects U.S onshore wind to decline from 15 gigawatts of new installations in 2021 to approximately 10 gigawatts in 2022. Despite the market uncertainty, we have maintained our leading position in the U.S. The offshore wind industry continues to experience strong global market momentum and we have received customer commitments for the Haliade-X spanning across Europe, North America and Asia. Customer preference continues to shift to larger, more efficient units to drive down costs and compete with other power generation options. The Grid and Hydro business units are executing their turnaround plans that include increased project selectivity discipline, cost reduction and investment in more profitable segments. We are monitoring the impact across our industries from rising inflationary costs of transportation and commodities, broader supply chain and permitting process challenges across the onshore and offshore wind industry.\n\nNew product introductions remain important to our onshore and offshore customers who are demonstrating the willingness to adopt the new technology of larger turbines that decrease the levelized cost of energy. We have observed significant market demand for our 5-6 MW Cypress and 3-4 MW Sierra Onshore units and our 12-14 MW Haliade-X Offshore units. Our Haliade-X prototype unit is currently operating at 14MW. Preparing for large scale production, while reducing the cost of these new product platforms and blade technologies remains a key priority. At Grid Solutions, new technology such as flexible transformers and g\u00b3 switchgears are solving for a more resilient and efficient electric grid and lower greenhouse gas emissions, respectively.\n\n",

Generally, a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities, delay earnings, and could result in the award decision being overturned and require a re-bid of the contract. Highly competitive activity within the commercial aerospace industry has included  substantial  discounts  and  other  financial  incentives,  performance  and  operating  cost  guarantees,  and  participation  in financing arrangements, in order to secure both new engine business and the aftermarket revenues associated with these products. Furthermore, our competitors, including our customers, may develop competing technologies which gain industry acceptance in advance  of  or  instead  of  our  products,  or  meet  particular  in-demand  technological  needs  before  us  or  with  technology  that  is superior to our existing or new technologies. For example, the enhanced focus on climate change has increased demand for more environmentally  sustainable  products  and  services,  as  described  below.  Our  competitors  may  develop  sustainable  products  or services that are available to our customers before our products or services, or that are adopted more readily than our products or services.  In  addition,  our  competitors  or  customers  might  develop  new  technologies  or  offerings  that  might  cause  our  existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete or otherwise decrease demand for our offerings. In addition, the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products that attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. We also anticipate companies continuing to enhance their competitive position against our defense businesses as a result of continued domestic and cross-border defense industry consolidation and the expansion  of  competitors'  capabilities  throughout  the  supply  chain  through  vertical  integration.  We  are  also  facing  heightened competition  domestically  and  internationally  from  foreign  and  multinational  firms. Additionally,  some  customers,  including  the DoD, are increasingly turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for information technology and other  support  work.  If  we  are  unable  to  continue  to  compete  successfully  against  our  current  or  future  competitors  in  our  core businesses,  we  may  experience  declines  in  revenues  and  industry  segment  share. Any  of  the  foregoing  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nWe Use a Variety of Raw Materials, Supplier-Provided Parts, Components, Sub-Systems and Contract Manufacturing Services, and  Significant  Shortages,  Capacity  Constraints,  Production  Disruptions  or  Price  Increases  Could  Increase  Our  Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products. Our reliance on U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers, subcontractors and service providers) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility  in  the  prices  and  availability  of  these  materials  and services. In many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, services support or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Our defense businesses are subject to specific  procurement  requirements  that  limit  the  types  of  materials  they  use,  which  may  further  limit  the  suppliers  and subcontractors  they  may  utilize.  They  also  must  require  suppliers  to  comply  with  various  DoD  cybersecurity  requirements. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues (such as issues with defects or fraudulent parts), closing, bankruptcy or financial difficulties of our suppliers, price increases due to inflation  or  otherwise,  or  decreased  availability  of  raw  materials  or  commodities,  including  as  a  result  of  war,  natural  disaster, health pandemic or other business continuity events, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers  or  increase  our  operating  costs.  We  believe  that  our  supply  management  and  production  practices  are  based  on  an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, our supply chain, as described above.\n\nDue to the Nature of Our Products and Services, a Product Safety Failure or Other Failure Affecting Our or Our Customers' or Suppliers'  Products  or  Systems  Could  Seriously  Harm  Our  Business. Our products  and  services  are  highly  sophisticated  and specialized, involve complex advanced technologies, are often integrated with third-party products and services and are utilized for specific purposes that require precision, reliability and durability. Many of our products and services include both hardware and software  that  involve  industrial  machinery  and  intricate  aviation  and  defense  systems,  including  commercial  and  military  jet engines, power and control systems and other aircraft parts, air and missile defense systems, and military sensors and command and control systems. Technical, mechanical and other failures may occur from time to time, whether as a result of manufacturing or design defect, operational process or production issue attributable to us, our customers, suppliers, third party integrators or others. In addition, our products could fail as a result of cyber-attacks, such as those that seize control and result in misuse or unintended use of our products, or other intentional acts. The impact of a catastrophic product or system failure or similar event affecting our or our customers' or suppliers' products or services could be significant, and could result in injuries or death, property damage, loss of strategic capabilities, loss of intellectual property, loss of reputation, and other significant negative effects. A product or system failure  could  lead  to  negative  publicity,  a  diversion  of  management  attention  and  damage  to  our  reputation  that  could  reduce demand for our products and services.

      "answer": "As of December 31, 2023, MMM reported a weighted average exercise price of $170.24 for its 29,754 thousand exercisable stock options. UNP showed a lower weighted average exercise price of $164.48 for its 1,423 thousand exercisable options, while UPS had the lowest at $116.59 across 1,004 thousand exercisable options. The differences in exercise prices could reflect varied equity compensation philosophies, with MMM and UNP setting higher strike prices potentially aligned with stronger stock performance expectations, whereas UPS\u2019s lower exercise price may indicate a different approach to incentivizing executives or a different timing of option grants.",

T o determine discount rates for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the Company uses a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of the Company's benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality , fix ed income debt instruments. The Company uses the single weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The Company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for the Company's significant pension plans. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. For the Company's U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2025 are 5.55% and 5.28%, respectively . The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is higher principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.\n\nThe Company plans to use an expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.25% for 2025, which represents an increase from the 7.00% assumption used for 2024. The Company's asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations with a focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market conditions. The Company reviews the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revises it as appropriate.\n\nFor non-U.S. benefit plans, actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country.\n\nIn  July   2024,  the  UK  Court  of A ppeal  upheld  a  ruling  in  the  matter  of  V irgin  M edia  Limited  v ersus  NTL  Pension  Trustees  II  Limited,  that  certain  historical amendments for contracted out defined benefit schemes were invalid if they were not accompanied by the correct actuarial confirmation, a decision that the Company was not a party to or involved in and could impact the Company's non-U.S. pension plan in the UK. The Company and its UK pension scheme trustee are reviewing this development, along with our actuaries, and considering whether this decision has any implications for its UK pension plan.\n\n104 Honeywell International Inc.",

We sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments. Our ability  to  perform  our  obligations  may  be  materially  adversely  affected  if  one  or  more  of  these  suppliers  is unable to provide the agreed-upon materials, perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or engages in misconduct or other improper activities.\n\nOur  future  success  depends  in  part  on  our  ability  to  develop  new  products  and  technologies  and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. Many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and systemintegration  processes.  Our  customers'  requirements  change  and  evolve  regularly.  Accordingly,  our  future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and  services  and  bring  those  offerings  to  market  quickly  at  cost-effective  prices.  Some  new  products, particularly in our Aerospace segment, must meet extensive and time-consuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control and may result in unanticipated delays. Additionally, due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services  required  by  our  customers.  To  the  extent  that  the  demand  for  skilled  personnel  exceeds  supply,  we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees. If we were unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our International Operations\n\nSales and operations outside the United States are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing  business  in  foreign  countries. In  some  countries  there  is  increased  chance  for  economic,  legal  or political  changes,  and  procurement  procedures  may  be  less  robust  or  mature,  which  may  complicate  the contracting  process.  Our  non-U.S.  operations  may  be  sensitive  to  and  impacted  by  changes  in  a  foreign government's  national  policies  and  priorities,  political  leadership  and  budgets,  which  may  be  influenced  by changes in threat environments, geopolitical uncertainties, volatility in economic conditions and other economic and  political  factors.  Changes  and  developments  in  any  of  these  matters  or  factors  may  occur  suddenly  and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments. Non-U.S. transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal systems.  Our  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  U.S.  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  including  laws  and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). An unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with U.S. or foreign laws could result in administrative,  civil  or  criminal  liabilities,  including  suspension  or  debarment  from  government  contracts  or suspension of our export privileges, and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non-U.S. operations.\n\nIn  addition,  some  non-U.S.  government  customers  require  contractors  to  enter  into  letters  of  credit, performance  or  surety  bonds,  bank  guarantees  and  other  similar  financial  arrangements.  We  may  also  be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known  as  offsets,  that  require  us  to  satisfy  investment  or  other  requirements  or  face  penalties.  Offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements. If we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected.",

Defense bookings were approximately $40 billion, $31 billion and $17 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nBacklog, which is equivalent to  our  remaining  performance  obligations  (RPO)  for  our  sales  contracts,  represents  the  aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations as discussed further below.\n\nWe believe defense bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense operations and are an indicator of potential future changes in these operations' Total Net Sales, because we cannot record revenues under a new contract without first having  a  booking  in  the  current  or  a  preceding  period.  Defense  bookings  generally  represent  the  dollar  value  of  new  external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated.",

Most of our revenue recognized at a point in tim e is for the m anufacture of business jet aircraft in our Aerospace segm ent. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the custom er obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the custom er of the fully outfitted aircraft.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, we had $ 90.6 billion of rem aining perform ance obligations, which we refer to as total backlog. W e expect to recognize approximately 45% of our rem aining perform ance obligations as revenue in 2025, an additional 40% by the end of 2027 and the balance thereafter.\n\nContract Estimates. The majority of our revenue is derived from  long-term  contracts and program s that can span several years. Accounting for l ong-term  contracts and program s involves the use of various techniques to estim ate total contract revenue and costs. W e estim ate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estim ated revenue and expected costs to com plete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.\n\nContract estim ates are based on various assum ptions to project the outcom e of future events that often span several years. These assum ptions i n cl u de  l abor  producti vi ty   an d  av ai l abi l i ty ;  th e  com pl ex i ty   of   th e  work  to  be  perf orm ed;  th e  cost  an d  av ai l abi l i ty   of   m ateri al s;  th e  perf orm an ce  of subcontractors; and the availability and tim ing of funding from  the custom er.\n\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claim s, award fees and incentive fees. W e include in our contract estim ates additional revenue for contract m odifications or claim s against the custom er when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim , the am ount can be estim ated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim , the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim . W e include award fees or incentive fees in the estim ated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estim ate the am ount of the fee. These estim ates are based on historical award experience, anticipated perform ance and our best inform ed judgm ent at the tim e.\n\nAs a significant change in one or m ore of these estim ates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our contract-related estim ates regularly . W e recognize adjustm ents in estim ated profit on contracts under the cum ulative catch-up m ethod. Under this m ethod, the im pact of the adjustm ent on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustm ent is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract perform ance are recognized using the adjusted estim ate. If at any tim e the estim ate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.\n\nThe impact of adjustm ents in contract estim ates on our operating earnings can be reflected in either operating costs and expenses or revenue. The aggregate im pact of adjustm ents in contract estim ates increased our revenue, operating earnings and diluted earnings per share as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 Compared with 2020 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations\n\nCash generated from operating activities in 2021 was $2.8 billion higher than 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher net income  of  $4.1  billion  after  adjustments  for  depreciation  and  amortization,  deferred  income  tax  provision,  stock  compensation costs, net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit, the goodwill impairment charge and debt extinguishment costs, as well as  lower  pension  and  PRB  contributions  to  trusts  of  $1.0  billion  in  2021  compared  to  2020.  This  was  partially  offset  by  an unfavorable change in working capital of $1.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to activity at the RIS and RMD segments in the first quarter of 2021 with no comparable activity in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the Raytheon Merger. This unfavorable change in working capital at RIS and RMD includes a cash outflow for accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of incentive compensation payments. Also included in the total unfavorable change in working capital was an increase in Contract assets principally driven by sales in excess of billings at Pratt &amp; Whitney and contractual billing terms on U.S. government  and  foreign  military  sales  contracts  at  RMD,  and  growth  in  accounts  payable  and  accounts  receivable  at  Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney due to an increase in sales volume as commercial aerospace recovers.\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  various  factoring  agreements  with  third-party  financial  institutions  to  sell  certain  of  its  receivables. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $0.2 billion in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. The year over year favorable impact from factoring activity was primarily due to the significant decline in sales  volume  in  2020  principally  driven  by  the  economic  environment  primarily  due  to  COVID-19.  Factoring  activity  includes amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customers' request for which we are compensated by the customer for the extended collection cycle.\n\n## 2020 Compared with 2019 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations\n\nCash generated from operating activities in 2020 was $1.5 billion lower than 2019. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net  income  after  adjustments  for  depreciation  and  amortization,  the  2020  goodwill  impairment  charge,  the  deferred  income  tax provision, stock compensation costs and net periodic pension and other post retirement income of $2.0 billion primarily driven by a decrease  at  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  and  Collins Aerospace  as  a  result  of  the  economic  environment  primarily  driven  by  COVID-19, partially offset by net income from RIS and RMD following the Raytheon Merger. Included in the decrease in operating cash flows was an increase in pension contributions, as further discussed below, and an unfavorable impact from accounts payable primarily at Collins Aerospace  and  Pratt  &amp; Whitney  due  to  a  decline  in  volume  principally  driven  by  the  economic  environment  primarily driven by COVID-19, which was partially offset by a favorable change in inventory at Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney due to  the  decline  in  volume  and  a  favorable  change  in Accounts  receivable  and  Contract  assets  due  to  the  timing  of  billings  and collections in 2020 across our segments.\n\nFactoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $1.3 billion in cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an increase of approximately $0.3 billion in cash generated from operating activities during the  year  ended  December  31,  2019.  This  decrease  in  factoring  activity  was  driven  by  a  decrease  in  factoring  levels  at  Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney primarily driven by lower sales volume.\n\nWe  made  pension  and  PRB  contributions  to  trusts  of  $59  million,  $1,025  million,  and  $55  million  in  2021,  2020,  and  2019, respectively.  The  contributions  in  2020  include  discretionary  contributions  of  $801  million.  We  make  both  required  and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding rules, which require us to fully fund our U.S qualified pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based on the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) calculated funded status at the beginning of each year. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year's expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities, which are dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and actuarial assumptions. We can contribute cash or RTC shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2021, the total investment by the U.S. qualified pension plans in RTC shares was less than 1% of total plan assets.",

See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' for more information.\n\nEnvironmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating liabilities a matter of judgment because of uncertainties with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination as well as such factors as changing remediation technologies and changing regulatory environmental standards. We are monitoring or investigating a number of former and present operating facilities for potential future remediation. We perform quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites and the related liabilities and receivables. Additionally, in our quarterly reviews, we consider these and other factors in estimating the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, and we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has occurred or will occur for a particular site and the loss can be reasonably estimated.  The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred for remediation for that site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure in all cases as, although a loss may be probable or reasonably possible, in some cases it is not possible at this time to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.\n\nWe also pursue claims for recovery of costs incurred or for contribution to site remediation costs against other PRPs, including the U.S. G overnment, and are conducting remediation activities under various consent decrees, orders, and agreements relating to soil, groundwater, sediment, or surface water contamination at certain sites of former or current operations. Under agreements related to certain sites in California, New Y ork, United States V irgin Islands and Washington, the U.S. Government and/or a private party reimburses us an amount equal to a percentage, specific to each site, of expenditures for certain remediation activities in their capacity as PRPs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).\n\nIn addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, potential new regulations concerning perchlorate and hexavalent chromium at the federal and state level could increase our cleanup costs. If substantially lower cleanup standards are adopted for perchlorate or hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in both our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of costs that are probable of future recovery. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.\n\nWe also are evaluating the potential impact of new, existing, and contemplated requirements addressing a class of chemicals known generally as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS are common and appear in products such as fire-fighting foams and stain- and stick-resistant products (e.g., Teflon, stainresistant fabrics) and have been used in manufacturing processes. Regulations requiring very low PFAS contaminant levels in drinking water could eventually lead to increased cleanup costs at a number of our environmental remediation sites.\n\n## Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Third-Party Guarantees\n\nWe have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. We had total outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds aggregating $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Third-party guarantees do not include guarantees issued on behalf of subsidiaries and other consolidated entities.\n\nAdditionally,  we  may  guarantee  the  contractual  performance  of  third  parties  such  as  joint  venture  partners. At  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  third-party guarantees totaled $351 million and $1.0 billion, of which approximately 30% and 75% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently  are  or  previously  were  a  party.  These  amounts  represent  our  estimate  of  the  max imum  amounts  we  would  ex pect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  nonperformance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. G enerally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts  that  may  be  paid  on  behalf  of  a  joint  venture  partner.  Third-party  guarantees  do  not  include  guarantees  issued  on  behalf  of  subsidiaries  and  other consolidated entities.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation - Aearo Technologies: On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies ('Aearo'). Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products. Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo's respirator business (American Optical Corporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation ('Cabot')) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $51 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related and coal mine dust claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the 'Payor Group'). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the 'AO Safety' brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo's share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving ex posure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo's potential liability is limited to ex posures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be ex posed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995, period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\n\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor G roup including ex haustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix ) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo's share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for ex isting and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued. Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo's liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\n\nEnvironmental Matters and Litigation: The Company's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic or hazardous substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, which are enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and many for which private parties in the United States and abroad may have rights of action. These laws and regulations can form the basis of, under certain circumstances, claims for the investigation and remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of and/or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damages. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital ex penditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury, natural resource, and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.\n\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\") and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where hazardous substances have been released or disposed of. The Company has identified numerous locations, many of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability for remediation of contamination under applicable environmental laws. Please refer to the section entitled ' Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Recovery ' that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.",

      "answer": "HON contributed $35 million to U.S. pension plans and $101 million to Non-U.S. pension plans in 2022, showing a balanced funding approach across geographies. LMT made no direct company contributions to its Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans in 2022 but contributed $45 million to retiree medical and life insurance plans, indicating a strategic shift toward non-pension post-retirement benefits. UNP, while not disclosing a specific dollar amount for pension contributions, highlights a structural shift away from defined benefit pensions for new hires after 2018 toward enhanced 401(k) plans, signaling a long-term de-emphasis on traditional pension funding. Together, these approaches reflect varying philosophies: HON maintains active pension funding, LMT prioritizes retiree healthcare benefits over pensions, and UNP transitions toward defined contribution models.",

This expense is subject to achievement of the performance measures established for the performance stock unit grants.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan - Our ESPP started in July 2021. Employee and Company contributions are used to issue treasury shares the month after employee contributions are withheld based on the settlement date closing price. The Company matches 40% contributed by the employee up to a maximum employee contribution of 5% of monthly salary (limited to $15,000 annually). We expense the Company contributions in the month the employee services were rendered (i.e., the month the employee contributions were withheld).\n\n## 5. Retirement Plans\n\n## Pension Benefits\n\nWe provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements. Non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2018, are no longer eligible for pension benefits, but are eligible for an enhanced 401(k) benefit as described below in other retirement programs.\n\n## Funded Status\n\nWe are required by GAAP to separately recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension plans as an asset or liability. The funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. Our non-qualified (supplemental) pension plan is unfunded by design. The PBO of the pension plans is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future compensation increases. Plan assets are measured at fair value. We use a December 31 measurement date for plan assets and obligations for all our retirement plans.",

      "answer": "Boeing reports a $17,976 million net actuarial loss for pensions in 2024, showing a slight decrease from $18,175 million in 2023, indicating ongoing pressure on its pension obligations. 3M discloses a $2,922 million net actuarial loss for U.S. pension benefits in 2024, a notable decrease from $4,809 million in 2023, suggesting some improvement in actuarial assumptions or market conditions. Union Pacific, in contrast, reports a minimal $11 million net actuarial loss in 2024, a significant decline from $159 million in 2023, indicating a much smaller exposure or more stable assumptions in their pension liability calculations. Together, these figures reveal differing levels of sensitivity to market fluctuations and actuarial assumptions across the companies' pension and postretirement benefit obligations.",

      "answer": "BA references Fair Market Value primarily in the context of stock option grants, where the exercise price is set at a premium (120%) to the fair market value of the company's stock on the grant date, with potential reductions based on performance metrics. HON also uses Fair Market Value as the baseline for setting the exercise price of stock options, ensuring that no option is granted below this value, and it calculates the fair value of these options using the Black-Scholes model for expense recognition. RTX, in contrast, applies Fair Market Value to a broader range of financial assets, including investments, pension-related assets, and trust-held marketable securities, using quoted market prices and discounted cash flow models for valuation. This reveals that while BA and HON focus on Fair Market Value in equity compensation structures, RTX emphasizes it in asset valuation and investment reporting.",

        "Hop 1: BA \u2192 Fair Market Value: BA uses Fair Market Value as the reference point for setting the exercise price of premium-priced stock options, which are granted at 120% of the grant date fair market value, with potential reductions based on performance.",
        "Hop 2: HON \u2192 Fair Market Value: HON sets the exercise price of stock options at no less than the Fair Market Value on the grant date and uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of these options for expense recognition.",

      "answer": "GD primarily focuses on real estate leases, with machinery and equipment representing a smaller portion of their lease obligations, indicating a preference for owned or outsourced equipment. GE reports machinery and equipment at an original cost of $21,036 million in 2021, with a net carrying value of $7,356 million, reflecting significant capital investment and depreciation in this category. MMM shows a much higher gross value of machinery and equipment at $17,305 million in 2021, with accumulated depreciation of $17,784 million, suggesting a long-term asset strategy with high capital intensity. Together, these figures highlight differing approaches: GD leans toward real estate and flexible equipment arrangements, GE maintains a substantial but depreciating machinery base, and MMM operates with a highly capitalized, long-term machinery and equipment portfolio.",

When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we include the impact of the option in the lease term for purposes of determining total future lease payments. As most of our lease agreements do not explicitly state the discount rate implicit in the lease, we use our incremental borrowing rate on the commencement date to calculate the present value of future payments.\n\nOur leases commonly include payments that are based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other similar indices. These variable lease payments are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Other variable lease payments, such as usage-based amounts, are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability, and are expensed as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments, the calculation of the ROU asset also includes any deferred rent, lease pre-payments and initial direct costs of obtaining the lease, such as commissions.\n\nIn addition to the base rent, real estate leases typically contain provisions for common-area maintenance and other similar services, which are considered non-lease components for accounting purposes. For our real estate leases, we apply a practical expedient to include these non-lease components in calculating the ROU asset and lease liability. For all other types of leases, non-lease components are excluded from our ROU assets and lease liabilities and expensed as incurred.\n\nOur  leases  are  for  office  space,  manufacturing  facilities,  and  machinery  and  equipment.  Real  estate represents over 75% of our lease obligations.\n\nThe components of lease costs were as follows:\n\n",

To  preserve  the  tax-free  treatment  of  the  Distributions,  we  may  be  limited  in  our  ability  to  pursue  certain  equity issuances, strategic transactions, repurchases, or other transactions (including certain dispositions of assets) that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business.\n\nIf Either Distribution, Together with Certain Related Transactions, Were to Fail to Qualify as a Transaction that is Generally Tax-Free, Including as a Result of Subsequent Acquisitions of Our Stock (Including Pursuant to the Raytheon Merger) or the Stock of Carrier or Otis, We Could Be Subject to Significant Tax Liabilities. We received (1) a private letter ruling from the Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  regarding  certain  U.S.  federal  income  tax  matters  relating  to  the  Separation  Transactions  and Distributions  and  (2)  an  opinion  of  outside  counsel  regarding  the  qualification  of  certain  elements  of  the  Distributions  under Section 355 of the Code. Although we intend for the Distributions generally to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that they will so qualify. Even if the Distributions were to otherwise qualify as tax-free transactions under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, either Distribution or both Distributions may result in taxable gain to us (but not our stockholders)  under  Section  355(e)  of  the  Code  if  such  Distribution(s)  were  deemed  to  be  part  of  a  plan  (or  series  of  related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable. If the IRS were to determine that any post-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier  stock,  Otis  stock,  or  our  stock,  as  applicable,  pursuant  to  such  a  plan  (when  aggregated  with  any  pre-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan) would represent a 50% or greater interest  in  shares  of  Carrier,  Otis,  or  us,  as  applicable,  such  determination  could  result  in  significant  tax  liabilities  to  us.  For purposes of this test, even if the Raytheon Merger were treated as part of such plan, it did not result in an acquisition of a 50% or greater interest in our shares pursuant to a plan. Any such tax liabilities imposed on us may adversely affect an investment in us. In addition, with respect to certain Separation Transactions, we obtained tax rulings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or opinions of external tax advisors, in each case, regarding the tax treatment of such Separation Transactions. Notwithstanding the receipt of such tax rulings and opinions, there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant Separation Transactions differs from the conclusions reached therein. In the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant Separation Transaction, we would be subject to significant tax liabilities, which may adversely  affect  an  investment  in  us.  Further,  under  a  tax  matters  agreement  that  we  entered  into  with  Carrier  and  Otis  in connection with the Separation Transactions and Distributions, each of Carrier and Otis generally is required to indemnify us for any  taxes  we  incur  resulting  from  the  Separation  Transactions  and/or  the  Distributions  to  the  extent  such  amounts  result  from certain disqualifying actions by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier or Otis, as applicable. Further, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is generally required to indemnify us for a specified portion of any taxes we incur (a) arising as a result of the failure of either of the Distributions and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree or a failure of any Separation Transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to so qualify, in each case, to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier, Otis, or us or (b) arising from certain audit or other adjustments to tax liabilities incurred with respect to Separation Transactions that were not intended to qualify as tax-free. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is responsible for (i) a specified portion of any installment payment we are required to make pursuant to Section 965(h)(2) of the Code and (ii) specified taxes that exclusively relate to the Carrier business or the Otis business, as applicable. The amount of any such taxes for which we would be responsible may be significant, and if we were unable to obtain indemnification payments from Carrier or Otis to which we are entitled under the tax matters agreement and/or other agreements entered into in connection with the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, we would incur significant losses.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

GE adjusts operating profit to exclude items not closely associated with ongoing operations, such as restructuring and gains from dispositions, to improve period-to-period comparability. RTX provides detailed operating profit figures for each of its major business segments (Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon), showing varying profit margins (12.2%, 5.2%, and 9.7% respectively), which reflects differing performance levels across its divisions.

          "chunk_text": "## Safe Harbor Statement\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains v arious forward-looking statements and includes assumptions concerning Emerson's operations, future results and prospects. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later dev elopments. In connection with the 'safe harbor' prov isions of the Priv ate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson prov ides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - 'Risk Factors,' which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or ev ents to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement the Company's financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain 'non-GAAP financial measures,' as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or div estitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management's control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believ es that the following non-GAAP financial measures prov ide inv estors and analysts useful insight into the Company's financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternativ e to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nUnderlying sales, which exclude the impact of significant acquisitions, div estitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are prov ided to facilitate relev ant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact ov erall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure: net sales ).\n\nOperating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrativ e expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit div ided by net sales) are indicativ e of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to ev aluate past performance and actions required to improv e profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense, net, related party interest income, and income taxes) and total segment EBIT, and EBIT margin (defined as EBIT div ided by net sales) and total segment EBIT margin, are financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes. Adjusted EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA (defined as earnings excluding interest expense, net, related party interest income, income taxes, intangibles amortization expense, restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees, and certain gains, losses or impairments) and adjusted EBITA margin and adjusted segment EBITA margin (defined as adjusted EBITA div ided by net sales) are measures used by management to evaluate the Company's operational performance, as they exclude the impact of acquisition-related inv estments and nonoperational items. EBITDA (defined as EBIT excluding depreciation and amortization) and EBITDA margin (defined as EBITDA div ided by net sales) are also used as measures of the Company's current operating performance, as they exclude the impact of capital and acquisition-related inv estments. Adjusted EBITDA (defined as EBITDA excluding restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees, and certain gains, losses or impairments) and adjusted EBITDA margin (defined as Adjusted EBITDA div ided by net sales) are also used to exclude the impact of non-operational items. All of these are commonly used financial measures utilized by management to ev aluate performance (U.S. GAAP measures: pretax earnings or pretax profit margin, segment earnings or segment margin ).\n\nEarnings and earnings per share excluding certain gains and losses, impairments, restructuring costs, impacts of acquisitions or div estitures, amortization of intangibles, discrete taxes, or other items prov ide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items.

      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) reports total lease liabilities of $492 million in 2022, derived from operating leases with payments extending beyond 2027. FedEx (FDX) discloses significantly higher total lease liabilities of $16,930 million, primarily from operating leases, with a weighted-average remaining term of 9.8 years and a discount rate of 2.85%. Union Pacific (UNP) shows total lease liabilities of $2,095 million, with $1,429 million in noncurrent operating lease liabilities and a more balanced mix of operating and finance leases. These figures indicate that FDX relies heavily on leased assets to support its logistics and transportation infrastructure, while UNP uses a combination of lease types, and EMR maintains a more modest leasing footprint, reflecting different capital deployment and financing strategies across the industrials sector.",

LMT discloses a significant pension settlement charge of $1,310 million in 2021, showing a major one-time pension-related cost that directly affected its comprehensive income. UPS quantifies the sensitivity of its pension obligations to changes in assumptions, noting that a 25 basis point shift in discount rate or return on assets would alter pension expense and obligations, signaling a high sensitivity to actuarial assumptions. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies are impacted by pension obligations, the nature and magnitude of the exposure varies significantly, with LMT experiencing the most substantial direct hit, followed by UPS with its assumption-driven sensitivity, and EMR treating it as a less prominent cost component.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar reported an actuarial loss of $394 million for U.S. pension benefits and a gain of $169 million for non-U.S. pension benefits in 2023. General Dynamics recorded an actuarial loss of $377 million for pension benefits. Lockheed Martin experienced an actuarial loss of $731 million for its qualified defined benefit pension plans. These differences highlight varying actuarial assumptions and market-driven volatility impacting each company's pension obligations, with LMT experiencing the most significant actuarial loss, indicating higher sensitivity to market or demographic assumptions.",

      "question": "How do Honeywell (HON), Lockheed Martin (LMT), and Union Pacific (UNP) each quantify or characterize their exposure to environmental liabilities, and what does this reveal about the varying degrees of financial and operational risk each company faces in addressing these obligations?",
      "answer": "Honeywell (HON) quantifies its environmental liabilities as $222 million as of December 31, 2023, with estimated 2024 payments of $227 million, indicating a significant and growing financial exposure. Lockheed Martin (LMT) does not provide a specific dollar amount but acknowledges environmental liabilities as part of its accounting estimates, highlighting the complexity and uncertainty in forecasting such obligations. Union Pacific (UNP) emphasizes the potential for future environmental liabilities due to the nature of its operations, noting that while reserves are adequate, actual costs may vary significantly due to regulatory, technological, and third-party participation factors. This reveals that HON faces a clear and immediate financial burden, LMT manages a less transparent but still material risk, and UNP anticipates uncertain but potentially escalating obligations tied to its extensive rail network and regulatory exposure.",

      "answer": "FDX notes that high employee turnover has led to increased training costs, which are part of broader labor cost pressures affecting its operational efficiency. GD highlights that the demand for skilled personnel has resulted in higher labor, recruiting, or training costs, which could materially affect future earnings. UNP specifically quantifies a 4% increase in compensation and benefits expenses in 2023, driven by wage growth, training costs, and a crew staffing agreement ratification charge. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face rising training costs, FDX is impacted by turnover, GD by talent scarcity, and UNP by structured labor agreements and training investments.",

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) recognizes actuarial gains and losses in shareholders\u2019 equity (net of taxes) and amortizes them over the average expected future lifetime of participants if they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities. General Dynamics (GD) defers actuarial gains and losses in AOCL and amortizes them over future years, with a custom amortization period for U.S. government pension plans and a 10% corridor for others, using average remaining service periods or life expectancy. Lockheed Martin (LMT) reports actuarial gains and losses with specific dollar amounts deferred and recognized annually, such as $698 million in 2023 for qualified pension plans, showing a pattern of volatility in recognition timing. Comparing these approaches, BA emphasizes threshold-based amortization, GD uses structured amortization corridors and custom periods, and LMT provides granular transparency into the deferred and recognized amounts, reflecting differing strategies to manage financial statement volatility.",

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) presents a detailed table showing changes in the PBO and plan assets for its pension plans, indicating a structured approach to pension liability reporting. General Dynamics (GD) reports a PBO of $13,019 million in 2023, up from $12,897 million in 2022, showing a growing liability. Union Pacific (UNP) notes that a decrease in the 2023 discount rate from 5.21% to 5.00% led to actuarial losses that increased the PBO, contrasting with 2022, where a significant rate increase from 2.80% to 5.21% resulted in actuarial gains that reduced the PBO. Together, these perspectives reveal differing sensitivities to interest rate assumptions and varying trends in pension liabilities across the three companies.",

        "Hop 3: UNP \u2192 PBO: UNP explains that the 2023 PBO increased due to a drop in discount rates, while 2022 saw a reduction due to a significant rate hike."

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) includes CAS pension cost in its business segment results and distinguishes it from FAS pension income/expense, with the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment reflecting the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension and total CAS pension cost. Raytheon (RTX) highlights that changes in pension assumptions like discount rates and expected returns on plan assets could significantly affect its earnings, equity, and pension contributions, emphasizing the sensitivity of these assumptions to financial outcomes. Union Pacific (UNP) quantifies the sensitivity of its pension expense to changes in discount rates and expected returns on plan assets, showing a $1 million increase in pension expense for a 0.25% decrease in discount rates and a $12 million increase for a 0.25% decrease in expected returns.

      "answer": "FDX reports a total operating lease liability of $17,516 million and a total finance lease liability of $431 million, indicating a dominant reliance on operating leases. RTX has a significantly smaller total operating lease liability of $1,999 million and does not separately disclose finance lease liabilities, suggesting a more limited leasing footprint. UNP shows a balanced approach with total lease liabilities of $1,380 million, comprising $346 million current operating lease liabilities and $925 million noncurrent operating lease liabilities, with minimal finance lease obligations. These differences highlight distinct capital strategies: FDX leans heavily on operating leases for asset access, RTX maintains a smaller and more conservative leasing profile, and UNP adopts a moderate and structured approach to leasing.",

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) recognizes revenue for long-term contracts and services with complex timing and performance obligations, often resulting in unbilled receivables or contract liabilities, which directly affects income recognition patterns. Emerson (EMR) applies an input-based method using incurred costs to recognize revenue over time for multi-year contracts, impacting income consistency and predictability. Union Pacific (UNP) reports a clear trend in operating income over three years, showing a decline in 2023 to $9.08 billion from $9.92 billion in 2021, indicating income volatility that may be influenced by external economic factors and internal cost structures. Together, these approaches reveal differing strategies to revenue recognition and income management: Boeing with contract complexity, Emerson with cost-based progress tracking, and Union Pacific with a transparent income trend reflecting macroeconomic pressures.",

        "Hop 1: BA \u2192 Income: Boeing discusses revenue recognition for long-term contracts, commercial spare parts, and services, which affects income timing and volatility due to unbilled receivables and contract liabilities.",

        "Hop 3: UNP \u2192 Income: Union Pacific discloses a drop in operating income from $9.34 billion in 2021 to $9.08 billion in 2023, reflecting income volatility influenced by fuel costs, freight revenues, and operating expenses."

      "answer": "GD provides a detailed qualitative explanation of its Right-of-Use (ROU) asset accounting, noting that it recognizes ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of future lease payments, with real estate comprising over 75% of its lease obligations. HON discloses a Right-of-Use asset-related deferred tax liability of $240 million in 2023, up from $212 million in 2022, indicating a growing leasing footprint. MMM, in contrast, shows a decline in its Right-of-Use asset-related deferred tax liability, from $210 million in 2022 to $194 million in 2023, suggesting a reduction or optimization in leased assets. These differences suggest that GD is actively managing a large and complex leasing portfolio, HON is expanding its leased assets, and MMM may be reducing its reliance on leasing.",

The Company recast historical periods to reflect this change in segment presentation. See Note 22 Segment Financial Data of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\nWe globally manage our business operations through four reportable business segments: A erospace T echnologies, Industrial A utomation, Building A utomation, and Energy and Sustainability Solutions.\n\n## AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n\n## Net Sales\n\n",

Additionally, the amendments require the disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources. We adopted this standard for the annual period ending December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis. We updated our segment disclosures to comply with the requirements. See 'Note 20: Segment Financial Data.' The adoption of the standard did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\n\nOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2024 are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\n\n## NOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\n\nAcquisitions. Our investments in businesses, net of cash acquired, in 2022 totaled $66 million and consisted of insignificant acquisitions.\n\nDispositions. In 2024, 2023, and 2022 cash inflows related to dispositions of businesses were $1,795 million, $6 million, and $94 million, respectively. Our dispositions of businesses in 2024 primarily consisted of the dispositions discussed below. Our dispositions of businesses in 2023 and 2022 were insignificant.\n\nOn March 29, 2024, we completed the sale of our Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within our Raytheon segment for proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion in cash, resulting in an aggregate pre-tax  gain, net of transaction and other related costs, of $0.4 billion ($0.2 billion after tax ), primarily recognized in Other income (expense), net within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nOn October 31, 2024, we completed the sale of our G oodrich Hoist &amp; Winch business within our Collins segment for proceeds of approximately $0.5 billion in cash, resulting in a pre-tax  gain, net of transaction and other related costs, of $0.1 billion, primarily recognized in Other income (expense), net within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nOn July 20, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the actuation and flight control business within our Collins segment to Safran S.A. for gross proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of progress towards regulatory approvals, held for sale criteria was met. As such, at December 31, 2024, the related assets of approximately $1.5 billion and liabilities of approx imately $0.6 billion have been accounted for as held for sale at fair value less cost to sell. Held for sale assets primarily include $0.7 billion of goodwill and intangible assets presented in Other assets and $0.3 billion of inventory presented in Other assets, current. Held for sale liabilities primarily include $0.4 billion of contract liabilities and other accrued liabilities presented in Other accrued liabilities. The closing  of  the  transaction  is  subject  to  regulatory  approvals  and  other  customary  closing  conditions.  This  disposition  does  not  qualify  for  presentation  as discontinued operations.\n\n## NOTE 3: GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nGoodwill. Changes in our goodwill balances for the year ended December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "GE reports that its capitalized software had a gross carrying amount of $2,356 million in 2022, with a net value of $717 million after accumulated amortization of $1,639 million. LMT discloses that its capitalized software totaled $1.4 billion in 2023, net of accumulated amortization of $2.8 billion, with amortization expense of $263 million in that year. UPS reports that its capitalized software had a gross carrying amount of $5,839 million in 2023, with a net value of $1,939 million after accumulated amortization of $3,900 million. These figures indicate that UPS has the largest investment in capitalized software, followed by LMT and then GE, suggesting varying levels of emphasis on internal-use software as a strategic asset across the three companies.",

      "question": "How do Caterpillar, Honeywell, and 3M each reflect the financial impact of postretirement benefits in their 2023 financial statements, and what does this reveal about their respective pension-related risks and obligations?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar reports a pension and postretirement benefits adjustment of -$10 million in its 2023 other comprehensive income, indicating a minor negative impact on its financial position. Honeywell shows a significantly larger pension and postretirement benefit adjustment of -$407 million in 2023, signaling a substantial liability or actuarial loss affecting its equity. In contrast, 3M\u2019s postretirement benefit obligation increased from $1,797 million to $1,897 million in 2023, with a funded status of -$917 million, revealing a growing underfunded liability. Collectively, these figures suggest that while Caterpillar's exposure is minimal, Honeywell and 3M face more pronounced pension-related financial pressures, with 3M showing a worsening funded status.",

      "question": "How do Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), and General Dynamics (GD) each reflect actuarial loss (gain) in their pension and postretirement benefit obligations for 2023, and what does this reveal about their respective actuarial assumptions and financial exposure to pension risk?",
      "answer": "Boeing reported an actuarial loss of $1,217 million for 2023, contributing to a net pension liability of $5,434 million. Caterpillar experienced an actuarial gain of $394 million in its U.S. pension benefits and a gain of $169 million in non-U.S. pension benefits, helping reduce its overall pension liability. General Dynamics, in contrast, recorded an actuarial loss of $377 million, which increased its pension liability to $13,736 million. These differences suggest varying actuarial assumptions and sensitivities to market and demographic risk factors across the companies.",

General Dynamics (GD) provides a detailed breakdown of unbilled receivables tied to long-term contracts, noting that these represent revenue recognized minus advances and billings, and expects to collect substantially all of the 2021 balance by 2022.

      "answer": "EMR reports that its machinery and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over 8 to 12 years and are reviewed for impairment based on estimated fair values. GE discloses that its machinery and equipment have depreciable lives ranging from 4 to 20 years, with an original cost of $21,036 million in 2021 and a net carrying value of $7,356 million. MMM reports machinery and equipment at cost, with a gross value of $17,305 million in 2021 and accumulated depreciation of $17,784 million, indicating a more mature asset base. These differences suggest EMR focuses on asset impairment testing, GE maintains a broader range of asset lives with significant remaining value, and MMM has a more depreciated asset base, potentially signaling different capital investment cycles.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Fair Value Measurement\n\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , establishes a formal hierarchy and framework for measuring certain financial statement items at fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements and the reliability of valuation inputs. Under ASC 820, measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Within the hierarchy, Level 1 instruments use observable market prices for an identical item in active markets and have the most reliable valuations. Level 2 instruments are valued through broker/dealer quotation or other approaches using market-observable inputs for similar items in active markets, including forward and spot prices, interest rates and volatilities. Level 3 instruments are valued using inputs not observable in an active market, such as company-developed future cash flow estimates, and are considered the least reliable. Valuations for all of the Company's financial instruments fall within Level 2. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is Level 2, estimated using current interest rates and pricing from financial institutions and other market sources for debt with similar maturities and characteristics.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nThe Company records investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment at cost. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over estimated service lives, which for principal assets are 30 to 40 years for buildings and 8 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Long-lived tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized based on estimated fair values if the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less than the carrying values.\n\nThe components of property, plant and equipment as of September 30 follow:\n\n",

      "question": "How do Caterpillar (CAT), Emerson (EMR), and Honeywell (HON) each characterize the composition and expected fulfillment timelines of their 2023 backlogs, and what does this reveal about their respective exposure to near-term demand strength and operational execution risks?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar reported a firm backlog of $27.5 billion at the end of 2023, with $5.8 billion not expected to be fulfilled in 2024, indicating a significant portion of long-term orders. Emerson disclosed $8.4 billion in backlog related to unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations, with approximately $1.3 billion from AspenTech and $400 million from National Instruments, showing a more diversified backlog structure due to acquisitions. Honeywell highlighted a robust backlog of $31.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, emphasizing its strong foundation for future growth and demand continuity. Comparing these figures, Caterpillar faces a higher proportion of delayed fulfillment, Emerson\u2019s backlog is shaped by recent acquisitions, and Honeywell\u2019s backlog supports sustained capital deployment and growth.",

      "answer": "MMM discloses $11.0 billion in liabilities for 'other environmental liabilities' as of December 31, 2023, with $10.6 billion added during the year due to developments in PFAS-related matters. RTX does not provide specific figures but states that it is subject to environmental liabilities and legal proceedings, though it does not expect them to have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition. UNP notes that it maintains reserves for environmental liabilities and obligations at existing sites, though actual costs may vary due to regulatory changes, third-party participation, and required remedial actions. Together, these disclosures reveal MMM's proactive accrual approach, RTX's qualitative minimization of risk, and UNP's emphasis on reserve adequacy and regulatory uncertainty.",

In contrast, 3M modestly increased its treasury stock at cost from $32,859 million in 2023 to $34,462 million in 2024, pointing to ongoing but tempered buyback efforts.

      "question": "How do Caterpillar (CAT), General Electric (GE), and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) each report participant contributions in their pension and postretirement benefit disclosures, and what does this reveal about the relative role of employee-funded components in their benefit structures?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar reports participant contributions of $4 million in 2021 for Non-U.S. Pension Benefits and $48 million in 2021 for Other Postretirement Benefits. General Electric discloses participant contributions of $15 million in 2021 and $69 million in 2020 for Principal Pension Plans, and $60 million in 2021 and $63 million in 2020 for Principal Retiree Benefits. Raytheon Technologies notes that participant contributions are part of the 'Other' category, primarily reflecting foreign exchange translation impacts and employee-funded inputs. Comparing these, CAT and GE show measurable participant contributions in specific benefit categories, with GE\u2019s amounts being significantly higher, while RTX integrates participant contributions within a broader, more opaque 'Other' line item, suggesting a different reporting granularity and potentially less emphasis on employee-funded components in their benefit structure.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar reported a pre-tax loss of approximately $586 million related to the divestiture of its Longwall business, primarily driven by the release of $494 million in accumulated foreign currency translation. General Electric disclosed a pre-tax loss of $170 million from the sale of its boiler manufacturing business in China in 2021. 3M recorded restructuring pre-tax charges of $437 million in 2023, significantly higher than the $59 million in 2022, and also noted the impact of divestitures such as the sale of its dental local anesthetic business. These figures reveal that CAT and MMM incurred substantial restructuring and divestiture-related losses in 2023, reflecting active portfolio reshaping, while GE's loss was smaller and occurred in a prior year, indicating a less aggressive restructuring timeline.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing reported the funded status of its pension plans by disclosing the PBO and plan assets, showing an unfunded liability. FedEx indicated that its U.S. pension plan had a PBO of $26,284 million with plan assets of $25,797 million, resulting in a net unfunded status of $487 million. General Dynamics had a PBO of $13,019 million and plan assets of $11,029 million, leading to a larger unfunded liability of $1,990 million.

General Dynamics emphasizes that supplier disruptions, regulatory delays, and international political and legal risks could materially affect its ability to meet customer commitments and impact backlog fulfillment. Raytheon Technologies reports a defense backlog of $63 billion as of December 31, 2021, noting that defense bookings are a key driver of future performance and are sensitive to contract cancellations, funding delays, and foreign exchange fluctuations.

The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of ASC 606.\n\nBCA total backlog of $296,882 million at December 31, 2021 increased from $281,588 million at December 31, 2020, reflecting new orders in excess of deliveries, increases in projected price escalation and decreases in the number of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially  offset  by  aircraft  order  cancellations. Aircraft  order  cancellations  during  the  year  ended December 31, 2021 totaled $27,542 million and primarily relate to 737 MAX and 787 aircraft. The net ASC 606 adjustments decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in an increase to backlog of $3,810 million primarily due to 777X aircraft, partially offset by 787 aircraft. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer controlled  contingency  may  exist,  as  well  as  an  assessment  of  whether  the  customer  is  committed  to  perform  or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. If 787 aircraft deliveries continue to be paused, we are unable to ramp up deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft, and/or if entry into service of the 777X, 737  MAX  7  and/or  737  MAX  10  is  further  delayed,  we  may  experience  additional  reductions  to  backlog  and/or significant  order  cancellations.  Additionally,  we  may  continue  to  experience  fewer  new  orders  and  increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand.\n\nAccounting Quantity The  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make  reasonably  dependable  estimates  of  the  revenue  and  cost  of  existing  and  anticipated  contracts.  It  is  a  key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program's life. Estimation of  each  program's  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.\n\nThe accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.",

          "chunk_text": "supplier base carefully to avoid or minimize customer issues. We sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments. Our ability  to  perform  our  obligations  may  be  materially  adversely  affected  if  one  or  more  of  these  suppliers  is unable to provide the agreed-upon materials, perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or engages in misconduct or other improper activities.\n\nOur  future  success  depends  in  part  on  our  ability  to  develop  new  products  and  technologies  and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. Many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and systemintegration  processes.  Our  customers'  requirements  change  and  evolve  regularly.  Accordingly,  our  future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and  services  and  bring  those  offerings  to  market  quickly  at  cost-effective  prices.  Some  new  products, particularly in our Aerospace segment, must meet extensive and time-consuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control and may result in unanticipated delays. Additionally, due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services  required  by  our  customers.  To  the  extent  that  the  demand  for  skilled  personnel  exceeds  supply,  we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees. If we were unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our International Operations\n\nSales and operations outside the United States are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing  business  in  foreign  countries. In  some  countries  there  is  increased  chance  for  economic,  legal  or political  changes,  and  procurement  procedures  may  be  less  robust  or  mature,  which  may  complicate  the contracting  process.  Our  non-U.S.  operations  may  be  sensitive  to  and  impacted  by  changes  in  a  foreign government's  national  policies  and  priorities,  political  leadership  and  budgets,  which  may  be  influenced  by changes in threat environments, geopolitical uncertainties, volatility in economic conditions and other economic and  political  factors.  Changes  and  developments  in  any  of  these  matters  or  factors  may  occur  suddenly  and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments. Non-U.S. transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal systems.  Our  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  U.S.  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  including  laws  and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). An unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with U.S. or foreign laws could result in administrative,  civil  or  criminal  liabilities,  including  suspension  or  debarment  from  government  contracts  or suspension of our export privileges, and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non-U.S. operations.\n\nIn  addition,  some  non-U.S.  government  customers  require  contractors  to  enter  into  letters  of  credit, performance  or  surety  bonds,  bank  guarantees  and  other  similar  financial  arrangements.  We  may  also  be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known  as  offsets,  that  require  us  to  satisfy  investment  or  other  requirements  or  face  penalties.  Offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements. If we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected.",

Our defense operations consist primarily of our RIS and RMD businesses and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $40 billion, $31 billion and $17 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nBacklog, which is equivalent to  our  remaining  performance  obligations  (RPO)  for  our  sales  contracts,  represents  the  aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations as discussed further below.\n\nWe believe defense bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense operations and are an indicator of potential future changes in these operations' Total Net Sales, because we cannot record revenues under a new contract without first having  a  booking  in  the  current  or  a  preceding  period.  Defense  bookings  generally  represent  the  dollar  value  of  new  external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar reported an underfunded status of $668 million for U.S. pension benefits at the end of 2021, with company contributions totaling $45 million during the year. 3M had a significantly larger underfunded status of $1,151 million for its qualified and non-pension benefits at year-end 2021, with $77 million in company contributions. Union Pacific, in contrast, does not provide pension benefits to non-union employees hired after January 1, 2018, and instead offers an enhanced 401(k) plan, signaling a strategic shift away from defined benefit liabilities. This reveals that CAT and MMM continue to manage significant pension obligations with differing contribution strategies, while UNP has restructured its retirement offerings to reduce long-term pension liabilities.",

This expense is subject to achievement of the performance measures established for the performance stock unit grants.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan - Our ESPP started in July 2021. Employee and Company contributions are used to issue treasury shares the month after employee contributions are withheld based on the settlement date closing price. The Company matches 40% contributed by the employee up to a maximum employee contribution of 5% of monthly salary (limited to $15,000 annually). We expense the Company contributions in the month the employee services were rendered (i.e., the month the employee contributions were withheld).\n\n## 5. Retirement Plans\n\n## Pension Benefits\n\nWe provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements. Non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2018, are no longer eligible for pension benefits, but are eligible for an enhanced 401(k) benefit as described below in other retirement programs.\n\n## Funded Status\n\nWe are required by GAAP to separately recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension plans as an asset or liability. The funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. Our non-qualified (supplemental) pension plan is unfunded by design. The PBO of the pension plans is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future compensation increases. Plan assets are measured at fair value. We use a December 31 measurement date for plan assets and obligations for all our retirement plans.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar (CAT) highlights that disruptions in global financial markets could limit its liquidity and that of its customers, dealers, and suppliers, which could adversely affect its business and competitive position. FedEx (FDX) notes that credit availability is a key macroeconomic factor influencing consumer and business spending, which directly affects its transportation volumes and yields. UPS, in contrast, emphasizes its disciplined debt management, including $1.5 billion in senior notes maturing in 2024 that it intends to repay or refinance, and shows a more controlled exposure to credit market volatility through its financing activities and lack of off-balance sheet obligations. Together, these perspectives illustrate CAT's concern with operational liquidity risks, FDX's sensitivity to demand driven by credit conditions, and UPS's proactive financial structuring to mitigate credit-related disruptions.",

      "question": "How do General Dynamics, RTX, and UPS each account for prior service credits in their pension and post-retirement benefit disclosures, and what do these differences suggest about their respective pension liabilities and actuarial adjustments?",
      "answer": "General Dynamics reported a prior service credit of $52 million in 2023 for pension benefits, contributing to a smaller net actuarial loss. RTX disclosed a prior service credit of $1,246 million in 2023, significantly reducing its accumulated other comprehensive loss related to pensions. UPS recognized a prior service credit of $69 million in 2021 as part of an interim remeasurement of its pension plans following the divestiture of UPS Freight. These differences suggest that RTX experienced a much larger pension liability adjustment due to plan amendments or assumptions, whereas General Dynamics had a more modest impact, and UPS's credit was tied to a strategic business decision. The comparative analysis reveals varying degrees of pension exposure and actuarial risk management strategies across the three companies.",

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) uses the sum-of-the-years'-digits method to depreciate machinery and equipment, indicating a front-loaded depreciation approach that aligns with potentially faster obsolescence or usage intensity. General Dynamics (GD) reports machinery and equipment at $7,067 million in 2024, showing a steady increase in asset base, though the depreciation method is not explicitly stated, suggesting a more standard or conventional approach. General Electric (GE) applies a 4- to 20-year depreciation range for machinery and equipment, with a net carrying value of $3,851 million in 2024, reflecting a diversified asset base with varied usage profiles. Together, these approaches highlight differing capital intensity and asset management strategies across the three industrials firms.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nUsed aircraft purchased by our BCA segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable v alue. Spare parts inv entory is stated at lower of av erage unit cost or net realizable v alue. We rev iew our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inv entory, including excess or obsolete inv entory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inv entories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.\n\nIncluded in inv entory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to rev enue when the deliv ery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take deliv ery of the contracted aircraft, we believ e that we would hav e the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds adv ances and is not considered to be otherwise recov erable, it would be written off against rev enue of the current period.\n\n## Precontract Costs\n\nWe may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recov ery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inv entories in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recov ery, the capitalized costs would be written off.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally ov er the following estimated useful liv es: new buildings and land improv ements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal method of depreciation for buildings and land improv ements is 150% declining balance and for machinery and equipment is sum-of-the-years' digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets, net and amortized using the straight line method ov er 5  years. Capitalized costs of software purchased as a serv ice are included in Other assets, net and amortized using the straight line method ov er the term of the hosting arrangement, which is typically no greater than 10 years. We periodically ev aluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable liv es assigned to long-liv ed assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.\n\nLong-liv ed assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair v alue less cost to sell. Long-liv ed assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recov erable. If the carrying v alue is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair v alue of the asset.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease under which we are the lessee at the inception date. Operating lease assets are included in Other assets, net, with the related liabilities included in Accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities. Assets under finance leases, which primarily represent computer equipment, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the related liabilities included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.

      "question": "How do Boeing (BA), FedEx (FDX), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) each disclose their net liabilities or obligations related to employee benefit plans, and what do these differences suggest about their respective approaches to managing long-term postretirement benefit obligations?",
      "answer": "Boeing reports a net amount recognized of ($5,434) million for its pension and other postretirement benefits, indicating a significant net liability. FedEx discloses a net amount recognized of ($487) million for its international pension plans and ($1,162) million for postretirement healthcare plans, showing a more diversified but still substantial liability. Lockheed Martin, in contrast, reports a net amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $8,675 million for its defined benefit pension plans, suggesting a large unfunded liability primarily driven by actuarial losses. These differences suggest varying degrees of pension underfunding and risk exposure, with LMT showing the largest actuarial losses, FDX managing a broader range of international and healthcare liabilities, and BA maintaining a large but relatively lower funded status compared to prior years.",

      "answer": "GE recognized a pre-tax gain of $12,362 million from the 2020 sale of its BioPharma business, reflecting a major divestiture strategy to streamline operations. Honeywell recorded a pre-tax gain of $95 million in 2021 from the sale of its retail footwear business, indicating a selective exit from non-core segments. 3M recognized a $387 million pre-tax gain from the 2020 divestiture of its drug delivery business and a $112 million gain in 2019 from the sale of its gas and flame detection business, showing a multi-year strategy to divest non-core healthcare and safety assets. Collectively, these gains highlight varying degrees of portfolio rationalization across the three industrial conglomerates.",

          "chunk_text": "Investments in private equity, real estate and collective funds held within our pension plans . Most investments are generally valued using the net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient for fair value provided certain criteria are met. The NAVs are determined based on the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds. Investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. Investments classified within Level 3 primarily relate to real estate and private equities which are valued using unobservable inputs, primarily by discounting expected future cash flows, using comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources, or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. See Note 12 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets may include loans and long-lived assets reduced to fair value upon classification as held for sale, impaired loans based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, impaired equity securities without readily determinable fair value, equity method investments and long-lived assets, and remeasured retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in the deconsolidation of that subsidiary and retention of a noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair value and Associated companies. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value and associated companies are valued using market observable data such as transaction prices when available. When market observable data is unavailable, investments are valued using either a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. These investments are generally included in Level 3.\n\nLong-lived Assets . Fair values of long-lived assets are primarily derived internally and are based on observed sales transactions for similar assets. In other instances for which we do not have comparable observed sales transaction data, collateral values are developed internally and corroborated by external appraisal information. Adjustments to third-party valuations may be performed in circumstances where market comparables are not specific to the attributes of the specific collateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market conditions due to the passage of time and the occurrence of market events since receipt of the information.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES. On January 1, 2021, we adopted ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The ASU removes certain exceptions from the guidance in ASC 740 related to intra-period tax allocations, interim calculations and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences and clarifies and simplifies several other aspects of accounting for income taxes. Different transition methods apply to the various income tax simplifications. For the changes requiring a retrospective or modified retrospective transition, the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact to our financial statements.\n\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses . ASU 2016-13 requires us to prospectively record an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses inherent in the asset over its expected life, replacing the incurred loss model that recognized losses only when they became probable and estimable. We recorded a $221 million increase in our allowance for credit losses and a $175 million decrease to retained earnings, net of tax, reflecting the cumulative effect on retained earnings.\n\nNOTE 2. BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. On December 1, 2021, we completed the sale of GE's share of our boiler manufacturing business in China in our Power segment. In connection with the transaction, we recorded a loss on the disposal of this business of $170 million in Other income in our Statement of Earnings (Loss). See Note 18 for further information.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our BioPharma business within our Healthcare segment for total consideration of $21,112 million (after certain working capital adjustments) and incurred $185 million of cash payments directly associated with the transaction. As a result, in 2020, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $12,362 million ($11,213 million after-tax) in our Statement of Earnings (Loss).\n\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS primarily comprise our GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) business, discontinued in 2021, our mortgage portfolio in Poland, and other trailing assets and liabilities associated with prior dispositions. Results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and the notes to the financial statements have been adjusted on a retrospective basis.\n\nGECAS. On November 1, 2021 we completed the combination of our GECAS business with AerCap for total consideration consisting of $22,583 million subject to future closing adjustments, 111.5 million shares of AerCap common stock (approximately 46% ownership interest) valued at approximately $6,583 million based on AerCap's closing share price of $59.04 on October 29, 2021, and a $1,000 million AerCap senior note with an interest rate of 1.899% and a maturity date of November 1, 2025. In connection with the closing of the transaction, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax loss of $3,312 million ($3,882 million after-tax) in discontinued operations. Additionally, we have elected to prospectively measure our investment in AerCap at fair value and expect to fully monetize our stake over time.\n\nWe have continuing involvement with AerCap, primarily through our ownership interest, ongoing sales or leases of products and services, and transition services that we provide to AerCap. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had direct and indirect sales of $29 million and purchases of $22 million with AerCap, primarily related to engine sales through airframers and engine leases, respectively.",

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\n## ACQUISITIONS\n\nOn  November  29,  2021,  Honeywell  Quantum  Solutions,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Honeywell,  and  Cambridge  Quantum Computing, a leading developer of quantum computing and quantum software, combined to form Quantinuum. Prior to closing the transaction, Honeywell held a 4.2% ownership interest in Cambridge Quantum Computing. At closing of the business combination, Honeywell contributed an additional $270 million of cash and is the controlling majority-owner of Quantinuum, with an overall 54% ownership  in  the  business.  Quantinuum  is  well  positioned  to  lead  the  quantum  computing  industry  by  offering  advanced,  fully integrated hardware and software solutions at an unprecedented pace, scale and level of performance to large high-growth markets worldwide. Quantinuum supports customer needs for improved computation in cyber security, drug discovery and delivery, material science, finance, and optimization across all major industrial markets. The business is included within Corporate and All Other, which is not considered a reportable business segment. The combination was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting; as such, assets and liabilities of Quantinuum are consolidated by Honeywell and included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Upon close of the transaction, Honeywell recorded a non-cash adjustment of $460 million in Additional paid-in-capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the contribution of ownership interest in Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum Computing for the formation of Quantinuum. In addition, Honeywell recognized a gain of $22 million related to the fair value remeasurement of Honeywell's existing 4.2% ownership interest in Cambridge Quantum Computing, which was recorded in Other (income) expense on in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Operations.  At  close  of  the  transaction,  the  fair  value  of  Cambridge  Quantum  Computing's noncontrolling interest in Quantinuum was $419 million. In December 2021, Cambridge Quantum Computing contributed cash of $12  million  to  Quantinuum,  increasing  their  noncontrolling  interest  and  decreasing  Honeywell's  additional-paid-in-capital.  As  of December 31, 2021, the assets and liabilities in Honeywell's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $90 million of intangible assets and  $943  million  allocated  to  goodwill,  which  is  non-deductible  for  tax  purposes.  The  purchase  accounting  is  subject  to  final adjustments, primarily for the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the shares outstanding of Sparta Systems, a leading provider of enterprise quality management software for the life sciences industry, for $1,303 million. Sparta Systems is expected to further strengthen the Company's leadership in industrial automation, digital transformation solutions, and enterprise performance management software. The  business  is  included  within  the  Performance  Materials  and  Technologies  segment.  The  assets  and  liabilities  acquired  with Sparta  Systems  are  included  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  as  of  December  31,  2021,  including  $383  million  of  intangible assets and $1,011 million allocated to goodwill, which is nondeductible for tax purposes. The purchase accounting is subject to final adjustment,  primarily  for  the  valuation  of  intangible  assets,  amounts  allocated  to  goodwill,  tax  balances,  and  certain  preacquisition contingencies.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Company  acquired  businesses  for  an  aggregate  cost  (net  of  cash  and  debt  assumed)  of  $261  million,  which included the October 2020 acquisition of Rocky Research and the December 2020 acquisition of Sine Group. Rocky Research is a technology leader specializing in thermal, energy and power management solutions and is included within the Aerospace segment. Sine Group offers a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that handles visitor management, workplace and supply chain solutions and is included  in  the  Honeywell  Building  Technologies  segment.  The  acquisition  of  Rocky  Research  and  Sine  Group  included approximately $167 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes.\n\nDuring 2019, there were no significant acquisitions that closed individually or in the aggregate.\n\n## DIVESTITURES\n\nOn March 15, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its retail footwear business in exchange for gross cash consideration of $230 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $95 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, which was recorded in Other (income) expense. The retail footwear business was previously included in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment.\n\nDuring 2020 and 2019, there were no significant divestitures that closed individually or in the aggregate.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.\n\n63",

Under the terms of the agreements, which involve a taxfree Reverse Morris Trust, the Food Safety business will be spun-off or split-off to 3M shareholders and simultaneously merged with NEOGEN. Existing NEOGEN shareholders will continue to own approximately 49.9% of the combined company and 3M shareholders will receive approximately 50.1% of the combined company. In connection with the transaction, the Food Safety business will incur new debt and fund to 3M consideration valued at approximately $1 billion, subject to closing and other adjustments. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2022, subject to approval by NEOGEN shareholders, receipt of required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Net sales information relative to the Food Safety Division is included in Note 2. Due to factors such as the potential nature of the transaction and underlying approvals, the Food Safety business is not considered held for sale as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2020 divestitures:\n\nIn January 2020, 3M completed the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business, formerly part of the Transportation and Electronics business, to Avon Rubber p.l.c for $86 million in cash and recognized certain contingent consideration from the outcome of pending tenders. Further contingent consideration of less than $25 million may be recognized depending on outcomes in the future. The business, with annual sales of approximately $85 million, consists of ballistic helmets, body armor, flat armor and related helmet-attachment products serving government and law enforcement. 3M reflected immaterial impacts in the third quarter of 2019 as a result of measuring this disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and in the first quarter 2020 related to completion of the divestiture and recognition of contingent consideration.\n\nIn May 2020, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its drug delivery business, formerly part of the Health Care business, to an affiliate of Altaris Capital Partners, LLC for $617 million in consideration including $487 million of cash, approximately $70 million in the form of an interest-bearing security, and approximately $60 million in the form of a 17 percent noncontrolling interest in the new company, Kindeva Drug Delivery (Kindeva). Non-cash consideration was valued at time of initial recognition on an income-based approach using relevant estimated future cash flows and applicable market interest rates while considering impacts of restrictions related to transferability. The divested business had annual sales of approximately $380 million. 3M retained its transdermal drug delivery components business. 3M reflected a pre-tax gain of $387 million as a result of the divestiture. The Company reflects its ownership interest in Kindeva using the equity method of accounting incorporating the recording of 3M's share of earnings/losses on a lag-basis based on availability of Kindeva financial statements. As a result, income/loss from this unconsolidated subsidiary began to be reflected in 3M's financial statements in the third quarter of 2020. Kindeva and 3M entered into certain limited-term agreements related to post-divestiture transition and supply services.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, 3M completed the sale of a small dermatology products business, formerly part of the Health Care business, for immaterial proceeds that approximated the business's book value.\n\n## 2019 divestitures:\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the Company sold certain oral care technology comprising a business and reflected an earnout on a previous divestiture resulting in an aggregate immaterial gain.\n\nIn August 2019, 3M closed on the sale of its gas and flame detection business, a leader in fixed and portable gas and flame detection, to Teledyne Technologies Incorporated. 3M's gas and flame business was part of the overall October 2017 acquisition of underlying legal entities and associated assets of Scott Safety. This business has annual sales of approximately $120 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $112 million.\n\n## Operating income and held for sale amounts\n\nThe aggregate operating income of these businesses, including the announced divestitures, was approximately $120 million, $160 million and $160 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts of major assets and liabilities associated with disposal groups classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2021 were not material.\n\n## NOTE 4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThere was no goodwill recorded from acquisitions during 2021 and 2020.

Advances  and  progress  billings  (contract  liabilities)  arise  when  the  Company  receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract.\n\nFinancial  Services  Revenue We  record  financial  services  revenue  associated  with  sales-type/finance  leases, operating leases and loans in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type leases, we recognize revenue if collection of the lease payments is probable. For sales-type and finance leases, we record customer  financing  receivables  at  lease  inception. A  customer  financing  receivable  is  recorded  at  the  aggregate  of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and any deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. For notes receivable, notes are recorded as customer financing receivables net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.\n\nIncome recognition is generally suspended for customer financing receivables that are uncollectible. We determine that a customer financing receivable is uncollectible when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we  will  be  unable  to  collect  amounts  due  according  to  the  original  contractual  terms.  We  determine  a  customer financing receivable is past due when cash has not been received upon the due date specified in the contract.\n\nWe  evaluate  the  collectability  of  customer  financing  receivables  at  commencement  and  on  a  recurring  basis.  If  a customer financing  receivable  is  determined  to  be  uncollectible,  the  customer  is  categorized  as  non-accrual  status. When a customer is in non-accrual status at commencement, sales-type lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is removed from non-accrual status. If we have a direct finance lease and/or a note receivable with a customer that is in non-accrual status, or a sales-type lease with a customer that changes to non-accrual status after commencement, we recognize contractual interest income as payments are received to the extent there is sufficient collateral and payments exceed past due principal payments.\n\nResidual  values,  which  are  reviewed  periodically,  represent  the  estimated  amount  we  expect  to  receive  at  lease termination  from  the  disposition  of  the  leased  equipment.  Actual  residual  values  realized  could  differ  from  these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur.\n\nFor operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  Operating  lease  assets,  included  in  Customer  financing,  net,  are  recorded  at  cost  and  depreciated  to  an estimated  residual  value  using  the  straight-line  method  over  the  period  that  we  project  we  will  hold  the  asset.  We periodically  review  our  estimates  of  residual  value  and  recognize  forecasted  changes  by  prospectively  adjusting depreciation expense.\n\nReinsurance  Revenue Our  wholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary,  Astro  Ltd.,  participates  in  a  reinsurance  pool  for workers'  compensation.  The  member  agreements  and  practices  of  the  reinsurance  pool  minimize  any  participating members' individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $126, $129 and $151 during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $129, $136 and $150 during 2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.

      "question": "How do Emerson (EMR), Honeywell (HON), and Union Pacific (UNP) each quantify the sensitivity of their pension expenses to a 0.25% decrease in discount rates or expected return on plan assets, and what do these differences suggest about their pension risk exposure?",
      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) states that a 0.25 percentage point decrease in U.S. and non-U.S. discount rates would increase the total projected benefit obligation by $100 and increase 2025 pension expense by $15. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would also increase 2025 pension expense by $15. Honeywell (HON) notes that changes in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets impact future pension expense, though it does not quantify the exact sensitivity, but it increased its expected rate of return on plan assets to 7.00% for 2024 from the prior year. Union Pacific (UNP) quantifies that a 0.25% decrease in discount rates would increase pension expense by $1 million, and a 0.25% decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by $12 million. These differences suggest that UNP is more sensitive to changes in asset returns, while EMR shows equal sensitivity to both rate changes, and HON, while acknowledging sensitivity, is more optimistic about asset returns going forward.",

      "answer": "Boeing highlights that its pension and postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on earnings, equity, and cash flows, with future contributions heavily dependent on market factors like discount rates and asset returns. Caterpillar discloses its use of detailed actuarial assumptions\u2014such as discount rates based on high-quality bond yield curves, expected returns on plan assets, and healthcare trend rates\u2014and notes that changes in these assumptions can materially affect financial statements. Honeywell's 2024 disclosures show a funded status deficit of $98 million for other postretirement benefits, with actuarial losses of $7 million contributing to a decline from a $116 million deficit in 2023. Together, these disclosures illustrate significant variability in funded status (Honeywell's deficit vs. Boeing's uncertain future contributions), differing actuarial approaches (Caterpillar's mark-to-market method vs. Boeing's CAS-driven allocations), and distinct liability exposures (Honeywell\u2019s healthcare liabilities vs. Boeing\u2019s broader pension and retiree health coverage).",

Potential  pension  contributions  include  both  mandatory  amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improv e the plans' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heav ily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these  plans  using  assumptions  with  respect  to  these  and  other  items.  Changes  to  those  assumptions  could  hav e  a  significant  effect  on  future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. For U.S. gov ernment contracts, we allocate pension costs to indiv idual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which can also affect contract profitability. We also prov ide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  cov erage  for  eligible  retirees  and  qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the lev el of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Pension Plans' on page 51 of this Form 10-K. Although under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) the timing of periodic pension and other postretirement benefit expense and plan contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.\n\n## Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  serv ices  we  prov ide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. gov ernment. The amount of our insurance cov erage may not cov er all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, space systems, spacecraft, satellites, missile systems, weapons, cybersecurity, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is av ailable outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. T he amount of insurance cov erage we maintain may be inadequate to cov er these or other claims or liabilities.\n\n## A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.\n\nA significant  portion  of  our  customer  financing  portfolio,  which  is  comprised  of  financing  receiv ables  and  operating  lease  equipment,  is  concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by v arying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 aircraft, and among customers that we believ e hav e less than inv estment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are  unable  to  redeploy  the  aircraft  on  reasonable  terms,  our  financial  position,  results  of  operations  and/or  cash  flows  could  be  materially  adv ersely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nProduct warranty liability - At the time we recognize a sale, we record estimated future warranty costs.  We determine the product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate ex perience to the current field population and dealer inventory.  G enerally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty ex perience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America).  We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.\n\nProduct liability and insurance loss reserve - We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates, and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. The amount of these reserves totaled $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the balance in both 2024 and 2023 consisted of unearned insurance premiums.\n\nPostretirement benefits -  We  sponsor  defined  benefit  pension  plans  and/or  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  (retirement  healthcare  and  life  insurance)  to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. There are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. The  actuarial  assumptions  we  use  may  change  or  differ  significantly  from  actual  results,  which  may  result  in  a  material  impact  to  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We utilize a mark-tomarket approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.\n\nPrimary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:\n\n- We use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today's dollars.  The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flowmatching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar's projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. We use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant  non-U.S.  plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n- The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted  by  short-term  market  swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. The expected return on plan assets is based on the fair value of plan asset allocations as of our measurement date, December 31.\n- We use the expected rate of compensation increase to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies.\n- The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate.\n- We use the mortality assumption to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants.",

      "question": "How do Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and 3M each approach the financial management of their postretirement benefit plans, and what does this reveal about their respective risk mitigation strategies and funding priorities?",
      "answer": "Boeing emphasizes the actuarial assumptions used in determining the net periodic cost of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the discount rate, long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend. These assumptions are key drivers in how Boeing manages its liabilities and reflects the funded status on its Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Lockheed Martin notes the significance of estimates in accounting for postretirement benefit plans as part of its broader financial reporting, indicating that these estimates are critical to understanding its consolidated financial statements and the potential variability in future obligations. 3M actively manages its pension and postretirement benefit funds with a focus on long-duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities, while maintaining a strategic asset allocation with defined tolerance ranges to ensure funding stability and reduce contribution risk.",

Emerson notes that the adoption of climate change-related technologies and initiatives may depend on the availability of financing for certain types of projects, which introduces uncertainty into market growth and competitiveness. FedEx emphasizes its capital-intensive operations and the importance of satisfactory financing availability in making major investments in aircraft, vehicles, and technology, especially in light of its recent debt issuances and share repurchase programs.

For example, since 2018, the U.S. and China have imposed tariffs on each other's imports. China is a very significant market for commercial airplanes and represents a significant component of our commercial airplanes backlog. Impacts from these or future potential tariffs, or deterioration in trade relations between the U.S. and one  or  more  other  countries,  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  financial  position,  results  of  operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.\n\nContract  and  program  accounting  require  judgment  relative  to  assessing  risks,  estimating  revenues  and  costs  and making  assumptions  for  schedule  and  technical  issues.  Due  to  the  size  and  nature  of  many  of  our  contracts  and programs,  the  estimation  of  total  revenues  and  cost  at  completion  is  complicated  and  subject  to  many  variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties  related  to  performance  on  contracts  are  considered  in  estimating  sales  and  profit  rates  and  are  recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Supplier claims and assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of future award fees are also included in sales and profit rates.\n\nWith respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs  and  routine  warranty  costs  are  accumulated  and  charged  as  cost  of  sales  by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity)  of  a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-term  production  effort  for  delivery  under  existing  and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units' expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program.  Several  factors  determine  accounting  quantity,  including  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix,",

Our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market.\n\nWe must anticipate and respond to market and technological changes driven by broader trends such as decarbonization and electrification efforts in response to climate change. Market growth from the use of cleaner energy sources, as well as emissions management, energy efficiency, lower greenhouse gas refrigerant usage, and decarbonization efforts are likely to depend in part on technologies not yet deployed or widely adopted today. We may not adequately innovate or position our businesses for the adoption of technologies such as battery storage solutions, hydrogen use cases in industry, mobility, and power generation, enhanced electrical grid demand management, carbon capture and sequestration or advanced nuclear power.\n\nThese trends and the relative competitiveness of our product and service offerings will continue to be impacted by uncertain factors such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies such as carbon taxes, greenhouse gas emission reductions, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy, or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects.\n\nIf We Are Unable to Defend or Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights, the Company's Competitive Position Could Be Adversely Affected\n\nThe Company's intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other confidential information. This intellectual property may be subject to challenge, infringement, invalidation or circumvention by third parties. Despite extensive security measures, our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems, employee theft, or other acts of industrial espionage. Should the Company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property, it may suffer competitive harm.\n\nWe Engage in Acquisitions and Divestitures, Which Are Subject to Domestic and Foreign Regulatory Requirements, and May Encounter Difficulties in Integrating and Separating These Businesses and Therefore We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits\n\nWe regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures. These activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions, and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In 2022 and in past years, we have made various acquisitions, including our majority stake in Aspen Technology, Inc., and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business, and may continue to do so in the future. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nOur Planned Sale of a Majority Stake in the Climate Technologies Business May Not Be Completed Within the Currently Contemplated Time Frame, With the Expected Terms or Costs, and May Not Achieve the Intended Benefits\n\nWe make no assurance regarding the terms, timing, costs or benefits anticipated from the planned sale of a majority stake in the Climate Technologies Business. Unforeseen developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax, regulatory and other approvals, could delay the proposed transaction, or cause it to occur on terms and conditions that are less favorable, or at a higher cost, than expected.",

Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.\n\nWe periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. A key element of our strategy is to de-risk the plan as the funded status of the plan increases. During 2021, as the funded status of the plans increased, certain assets were reallocated to fixed income. The  changes  in  the  asset  allocation  are  reflected  in  the  asset  allocation  table  below.  We  identify  investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy  changes,  market  value  fluctuations,  the  length  of  time  it  takes  to  fully  implement  investment  allocation positions,  and  the  timing  of  benefit  payments  and  contributions.  Short-term  investments  and  exchange-traded derivatives  are  used  to  rebalance  the  actual  asset  allocation  to  the  target  asset  allocation.  The  asset  allocation  is monitored  and  rebalanced  frequently.  The  actual  and  target  allocations  by  asset  class  for  the  pension  assets  at December 31 were as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## LONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist. If the Company determines that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk. Estimates of future sales, operating results, cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including such factors as the general level of market interest rates, expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served, particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time.\n\n## RETIREMENT PLANS\n\nThe Company maintains a prudent long-term investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations. The determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions, including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the Company's assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods. The Company's principal U.S. defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $513 in total (approximately 16 percent in excess of the projected benefit obligation), including unfunded plans totaling $162. The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $57, including unfunded plans totaling $236. The Company contributed a total of $43 to defined benefit plans in 2022 and expects to contribute approximately $40 in 2023. At year-end 2022, the discount rate for U.S. plans was 5.64 percent, and was 2.92 percent in 2021. The assumed investment return on plan assets was 6.00 percent in 2022, 6.50 percent in 2021 and 6.75 percent in 2020, and will be 6.00 percent for 2023. While management believes its assumptions used are appropriate, actual experience may differ. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the U.S. and non-U.S. discount rates would have increased the total projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2022 by $100 and increased fiscal 2023 pension expense by $15. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase fiscal 2023 pension expense by $15. See Note 12.\n\n## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nThe Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos) and other matters, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivables. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. See Note 13.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid (received) on items included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Company provides eligible retirees in the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings account benefits-based plan. The contributions provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5 percent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.\n\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 2.89% for the U.S. pension plans and 2.88% for the postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2021, which is an increase of 0.34 percentage points and 0.38 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2020. An increase in the discount rate decreases the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), the increase in the discount rate as of December 31, 2021 resulted in an approximately $0.9 billion lower benefit obligation for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans.\n\nThe Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company's assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 6.50% in 2021. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's 2022 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 6.00%. The expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The 2021 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 22% global equities, 12% private equities, 50% fixed-income securities, and 16% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment management. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2021 was 6.7%. In 2020 the plan earned a rate of return of 13.6% and in 2019 earned a return of 16.3%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 8.6% and 8.7%, respectively. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company converted to the 'Pri-2012 Aggregate Mortality Table'. In 2021 the Company updated the mortality improvement scales to the Society of Actuaries Scale MP- 2021. The December 31, 2021 update resulted in an immaterial increase to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.\n\nDuring 2021, the Company contributed $177 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. During 2020, the Company contributed $153 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. In 2022, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $200 million of cash to its U.S. and international retirement plans. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2022. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors.",

General Dynamics defers actuarial gains and losses in AOCL and amortizes them on a straight-line basis over future years for qualified pension and other post-retirement plans, with a similar approach for prior service costs or credits.

          "chunk_text": "## Postretirement Plans\n\nMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement  savings  plan  in  2016.  Additional  union  employees  transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee's annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of the service cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and  reflected  in  inventory  at  the  end  of  a  reporting  period.  Actuarial  gains  and  losses,  which  occur  when  actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders' equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, we amortize them over the average expected future  lifetime  of  participants.  The  funded  status  of  our  pension  and  postretirement  plans  is  reflected  on  the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## Postemployment Plans\n\nWe record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.\n\n## Environmental Remediation\n\nWe are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,  obligations  and  commitments  for  remediation  of  contaminated  sites, including  assessments  of  ranges  and  probabilities  of  recoveries  from  other  responsible  parties  and/or  insurance carriers.  Our  policy  is  to  accrue  and  charge  to  current  expense  identified  exposures  related  to  environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value  as  the  timing  of  payments  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated.  We  may  be  able  to  recover  a  portion  of  the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $47 and $74 at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe",

We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense and, if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The balance of accrued interest and penalties was $55 million on May 31, 2022 and $61 million on May 31, 2021. Our consolidated statements of income for 2021 include $20 million of interest expense associated with our uncertain tax positions while interest and penalty expense for 2022 and 2020 are immaterial.\n\nIt is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions. Changes may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits, appeals, or litigation in state, local, federal, and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the resolution of various proceedings between U.S. and foreign tax authorities. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months. However, estimates of the amounts or ranges for individual matters where a material change is reasonably possible cannot be made. We believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax reserves, including interest and penalties, for any adjustments that may occur.\n\n## NOTE 14: RETIREMENT PLANS\n\nWe sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and postretirement healthcare plans.\n\nThe accounting guidance related to postretirement benefits requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in either expense or AOCI of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. We use MTM accounting for the recognition of our actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans as described in Note 1. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan's assets and the PBO of the plan.\n\nA summary of our retirement plan costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) reported $2,922 million in cash provided by operating activities in 2022, a decline from $3,575 million in 2021, largely due to a $515 million decrease in operating working capital and one-time gains on the sale of businesses and subordinated interest totaling $939 million. Raytheon (RTX) experienced a $2.8 billion increase in operating cash flow in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by higher net income and lower pension contributions, though this was partially offset by an unfavorable $1.1 billion change in working capital, particularly in the RIS and RMD segments. Union Pacific (UNP) consistently generated strong operating cash flow, with $9,032 million in 2021 and $8,540 million in 2020, translating to a 93% and 105% cash flow conversion rate relative to net income, respectively. This reveals that while EMR faced a notable drop in operating cash flow with significant one-time items, RTX showed recovery and UNP maintained stable and efficient cash generation from operations.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 Compared with 2020 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations\n\nCash generated from operating activities in 2021 was $2.8 billion higher than 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher net income  of  $4.1  billion  after  adjustments  for  depreciation  and  amortization,  deferred  income  tax  provision,  stock  compensation costs, net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit, the goodwill impairment charge and debt extinguishment costs, as well as  lower  pension  and  PRB  contributions  to  trusts  of  $1.0  billion  in  2021  compared  to  2020.  This  was  partially  offset  by  an unfavorable change in working capital of $1.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to activity at the RIS and RMD segments in the first quarter of 2021 with no comparable activity in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the Raytheon Merger. This unfavorable change in working capital at RIS and RMD includes a cash outflow for accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of incentive compensation payments. Also included in the total unfavorable change in working capital was an increase in Contract assets principally driven by sales in excess of billings at Pratt &amp; Whitney and contractual billing terms on U.S. government  and  foreign  military  sales  contracts  at  RMD,  and  growth  in  accounts  payable  and  accounts  receivable  at  Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney due to an increase in sales volume as commercial aerospace recovers.\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  various  factoring  agreements  with  third-party  financial  institutions  to  sell  certain  of  its  receivables. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $0.2 billion in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. The year over year favorable impact from factoring activity was primarily due to the significant decline in sales  volume  in  2020  principally  driven  by  the  economic  environment  primarily  due  to  COVID-19.  Factoring  activity  includes amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customers' request for which we are compensated by the customer for the extended collection cycle.\n\n## 2020 Compared with 2019 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations\n\nCash generated from operating activities in 2020 was $1.5 billion lower than 2019. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net  income  after  adjustments  for  depreciation  and  amortization,  the  2020  goodwill  impairment  charge,  the  deferred  income  tax provision, stock compensation costs and net periodic pension and other post retirement income of $2.0 billion primarily driven by a decrease  at  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  and  Collins Aerospace  as  a  result  of  the  economic  environment  primarily  driven  by  COVID-19, partially offset by net income from RIS and RMD following the Raytheon Merger. Included in the decrease in operating cash flows was an increase in pension contributions, as further discussed below, and an unfavorable impact from accounts payable primarily at Collins Aerospace  and  Pratt  &amp; Whitney  due  to  a  decline  in  volume  principally  driven  by  the  economic  environment  primarily driven by COVID-19, which was partially offset by a favorable change in inventory at Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney due to  the  decline  in  volume  and  a  favorable  change  in Accounts  receivable  and  Contract  assets  due  to  the  timing  of  billings  and collections in 2020 across our segments.\n\nFactoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $1.3 billion in cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an increase of approximately $0.3 billion in cash generated from operating activities during the  year  ended  December  31,  2019.  This  decrease  in  factoring  activity  was  driven  by  a  decrease  in  factoring  levels  at  Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney primarily driven by lower sales volume.\n\nWe  made  pension  and  PRB  contributions  to  trusts  of  $59  million,  $1,025  million,  and  $55  million  in  2021,  2020,  and  2019, respectively.  The  contributions  in  2020  include  discretionary  contributions  of  $801  million.  We  make  both  required  and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding rules, which require us to fully fund our U.S qualified pension plans over a rolling sevenyear period as determined annually based on the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) calculated funded status at the beginning of each year. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year's expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities, which are dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and actuarial assumptions. We can contribute cash or RTC shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2021, the total investment by the U.S. qualified pension plans in RTC shares was less than 1% of total plan assets.",

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) highlights that the pending acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems introduces uncertainty and potential financial risks, including the assumption of Spirit\u2019s net debt, which could adversely affect Boeing\u2019s financial position and net profit. General Dynamics (GD) notes that approximately 70% of its consolidated revenue comes from the U.S. government, making its net profit highly sensitive to changes in defense spending and budget allocations. Raytheon (RTX) explains that U.S. government contracts\u2014especially fixed-price development contracts\u2014carry significant financial risk due to potential cost overruns, performance delays, and contract termination, all of which could negatively impact net profit. When synthesized, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies are exposed to U.S. government contract dynamics, Boeing faces integration and acquisition-related profit risk, General Dynamics is most directly exposed to shifts in federal defense spending, and Raytheon faces operational and cost-control risks tied to contract structure and performance.",

(Spirit) subjects us to various risks and uncertainties, including risks that we may not complete the acquisition or realize the anticipated benefits in the expected timeframe or at all.\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) to acquire Spirit in an all-stock transaction that will include the assumption of Spirit's net debt at closing. Completion of our acquisition of Spirit is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. On January 31, 2025, Spirit's stockholders approv ed the Merger Agreement and the related transactions. Some of the remaining conditions, such as certain regulatory approv als and the ability of Spirit to enter into definitiv e agreements relating to the disposition of Spirit operations related to certain Airbus commercial work packages and consummate the related transactions, are beyond our control, which make the completion of our acquisition of Spirit  (and  the  timing  thereof)  uncertain.  In  addition,  if  Spirit  or  Boeing  exercise  certain  termination  rights  included  in  the  Merger  Agreement,  the acquisition will not be consummated. Furthermore, the gov ernmental authorities from which regulatory approv als related to the acquisition are required may impose burdensome or unacceptable conditions on the completion of the acquisition, require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement, or prev ent or delay the consummation of the acquisition. If the acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business may be adv ersely affected and we will be subject to a number of risks, including expenditure of time and resources, negativ e reactions from stakeholders, and potential stock price fluctuations. If we are successful in completing the acquisition, we will be subject to other risks, including those related to the assumption of Spirit's net debt and other obligations at closing, which could adv ersely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Difficulties in integrating Spirit may result in the failure to realize anticipated benefits of the acquisition (including anticipated synergies and quality improv ements) in the expected timeframe or at all, as well as operational challenges, the div ersion of management's attention from other ongoing business concerns, and unforeseen expenses, which may  have  an  adv erse  impact  on  our  operations  and  our  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows.  For  additional  information  on  the acquisition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint v entures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions, including our acquisition of Spirit, and related activ ities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and serv ice portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adv ersely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, cybersecurity issues or v ulnerabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint v entures could also impact our reported results of operations  or  financial  position.  We  also  may  make  strategic  div estitures  from  time  to  time.  T hese  transactions  may  result  in  continued  financial inv olv ement in the div ested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those div ested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.",

RISK FACTORS\n\nAn investment in our com m on stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. Investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other inform ation contained in this annual report on Form  10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our securities.\n\nInvestment risks can be m arket-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or com pany . The m arket risks faced by an investor in our securities are sim il ar to the uncertai nti es f aced by i nvestors i n a broad range of i ndustri es. There are som e risks that apply m ore specifically to our business.\n\nOur revenue is concentrated with the U.S. governm ent. This custom er relationship involves som e specific risks. In addition, our sales to non-U.S. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. Despite the varying nature of our governm ent and com m ercial operations and the m arkets they serve, each segm ent shares som e com m on risks, such as the ongoing developm ent of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of com m odities and subsystem s.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry\n\nThe U.S. government provides a significant portion of our revenue. Approximately 70% of our consolidated revenue was from the  U.S. government. Levels of U.S. defense spending m ay be im pacted by num erous factors, such as the dom estic political environm ent, changes in national and international priorities, and threats to national security . Com peting dem ands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending. Decreases i n   U.S. governm ent defense and other spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or m ore of our program s being reduced, delayed or term inated, which could im pact our financial perform ance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe face risks relating to our U.S. government contracts and programs, including the mix of our U.S. government contracts and programs, our performance, and our ability to control costs. The termination of one or more of our U.S. government contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns (due to inflation  or  otherwise),  product  failures,  shortages  in  materials,  components,  or  labor,  contract  definitization  delays,  or  other  failures  to  perform  to  customer expectations and contract requirements, could negatively impact our reputation and competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. U.S. government  contracts  with  prime  contractors  generally  permit  the  government  to  terminate  the  contract,  in  whole  or  in  part,  without  prior  notice,  at  the  U.S. government's convenience or for default based on performance. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs, and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some programs, and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We may not be able to offset lost revenues resulting from contract termination. Moreover, because the funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables, and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. The timing of contract definitization can be affected by factors specific to the U.S. government, including staffing limitations. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced, or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve the development, application, and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result of untested or unproven technologies, or modified requirements or specifications, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties (including delays, setbacks, cost overruns, or product failures), our attention or resources may be diverted from other projects, and our future sales opportunities may be impacted. Additionally, as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions, we may be required to invest in development prior to contract award with no guarantee of award.\n\nOur profitability could be negatively affected based on the mix of our U.S. government contracts and programs and the costs incurred of performing the work, especially if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, particularly under fix ed-price development contracts. Our U.S. government contracts are typically either fix ed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fix ed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fix ed-price (FFP) contracts or fix ed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fix ed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur, and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts, which may result in a cumulative adjustment in the period our estimates change. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and are typically paid a fix ed or performance-based fee, but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized costs exceeding a cost ceiling amount or costs not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations. Excess costs on cost reimbursable contracts could also result in lower profit rates. We may incur unexpected costs for various reasons, including technical and manufacturing challenges, schedule delays, the timeliness and availability of materials, components, or labor, the inaccuracy of initial contract cost estimates, internal and subcontractor performance or product quality issues, inability to achieve the benefits of our expected cost reduction, digital transformation, manufacturing, operating, and other strategic initiatives, inflation, inability to pass on tariff costs, and changing laws or regulations, natural disasters, and public health crises. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are often cost reimbursable, they can be FFP or FPI, which can significantly increase our risk of a potential negative profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth.  In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements, under which it awards  certain  prototypes,  research,  and  production  contracts  without  all  of  the  procurement  requirements  that  typically  apply  to  DoD  contracts,  including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracting during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract cost sharing. They may also require non-traditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to bid for OTA work and/or perform on our OTA agreements, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. In addition, in order to support U.S. government priorities, we may begin performance on an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price before completing contract",

      "answer": "Boeing provides detailed historical data showing a reduction in unbilled receivables from ($23) billion in 2022 to ($19) billion in 2023, indicating improved billing efficiency or contract completion. General Dynamics highlights unbilled receivables as part of long-term contracts, specifically referencing a net advance payment of $271 million from the Spanish Ministry of Industry in 2023, which affects the timing of revenue recognition. Honeywell explains that unbilled receivables arise due to timing differences between revenue recognition and billing, particularly when milestones must be met before billing can occur. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies manage unbilled receivables through contract-based revenue recognition, they differ in how they disclose and operationalize the timing and triggers for billing.",

      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) saw a significant increase in diluted EPS from $3.24 in 2020 to $5.41 in 2022, reflecting strong earnings growth and a declining weighted average diluted share count. In contrast, 3M (MMM) reported a more moderate rise in diluted EPS from $7.72 in 2019 to $10.12 in 2021, with relatively stable share dilution over the period. Union Pacific (UNP) experienced diluted EPS growth from $8.38 in 2019 to $9.95 in 2021, with minimal dilution effects from stock options and retention shares. The comparison shows that EMR had the most aggressive EPS growth, likely due to both operational improvements and share count reduction, while MMM and UNP showed more stable but less dynamic EPS trajectories.",

        "Hop 2: MMM \u2192 Earnings Per Share Diluted: MMM's diluted EPS rose from $7.72 (2019) to $10.12 (2021), with a relatively stable diluted share count (585.3M in 2021 vs. 582.2M in 2020), suggesting consistent stock-based compensation but no major buybacks.",

      "question": "How do Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), and General Dynamics (GD) each reflect the impact of actuarial losses or gains on their pension obligations in 2024, and what do their respective disclosures suggest about the sensitivity of their pension liabilities to changes in discount rates?",
      "answer": "Boeing (BA) reported an actuarial loss of $225 million (net of tax of $1) in 2024 related to pension and postretirement benefit plans, indicating a negative impact from changes in assumptions or market conditions. Caterpillar (CAT) showed no actuarial loss in 2024 for U.S. pension benefits but recognized a $59 million actuarial loss in non-U.S. pension benefits, reflecting regional differences in liability sensitivity. General Dynamics (GD) experienced an actuarial gain in 2024 due to an increase in the weighted-average discount rate from 4.83% to 5.40%, which reduced its pension benefit obligation. These differences suggest that while GD benefited from rising discount rates, BA and CAT faced increased liabilities, with CAT's non-U.S. plans being more vulnerable.",

      "answer": "General Dynamics discusses progress payments in the context of reducing unbilled receivables on a wheeled vehicle contract, noting that $3.3 billion in net unbilled receivables as of December 31, 2021, were reduced to $2 billion by progress payments received in 2020 and 2021, with the remainder expected to be liquidated by 2023. Lockheed Martin notes that the U.S. Government prefers progress payments over performance-based payments on fixed-price contracts and highlights that a 2020 DoD increase in progress payment rates from 80% to 90% positively affected cash flows. Raytheon Technologies explains that progress payments under U.S. government fixed-price contracts are typically made at 80\u201390% of incurred costs, resulting in revenue recognized in excess of billings, which is recorded as Contract Assets on the balance sheet. Together, these perspectives reveal differing strategic and operational approaches: GD emphasizes progress payments as a resolution mechanism for aging receivables, LMT focuses on policy shifts affecting cash flow predictability, and RTX details the accounting treatment and structural implications of progress payments on financial reporting.",

We  had experienced payment delays in 2018 and 2019 on a wheeled vehicle contract that was negotiated in 2012 before finalizing a contract amendment in 2020 with the customer that included a revised payment schedule. Under the amended  contract,  we  have  received  progress  payments  in  2020  and  2021  that  have  reduced  the  program's unbilled  balance  to  $2  billion.  The  remaining  scheduled  progress  payments  will  liquidate  the  net  unbilled receivables  balance  by  the  end  of  2023.  A  separate  tracked  vehicle  contract  that  was  signed  in  2010  has experienced an unbilled receivable build-up over the past year while we work to resolve concerns that were raised by the customer on certain aspects of the program. As a result, the balance on this program has grown to $1.3  billion.  Other  than  the  balance  related  to  the  two  large  international  contracts,  we  expect  to  bill substantially all of the remaining year-end 2021 net unbilled receivables balance during 2022. The amount not expected to be billed in 2022 results primarily from the agreed-upon contractual billing terms.\n\nG&amp;A costs in unbilled revenue on December 31, 2021 and 2020, were $501 and $427, respectively.\n\n## G. INVENTORIES\n\nThe majority of our inventories are for business jet aircraft. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Work in process represents largely labor, material and overhead costs associated with aircraft in the manufacturing process and is based primarily on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. Raw materials  are  valued  primarily  on  the  first-in,  first-out  method.  We  record  pre-owned  aircraft  acquired  in connection with the sale of new aircraft at the lower of the trade-in value or the estimated net realizable value.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect Space's 2022 net sales to decrease in the mid-single digit levels from 2021 primarily driven by the renationalization of  the  AWE  and  lower  volume  on  OPIR/SBIRS  due  to  program  lifecycles,  partially  offset  by  growth  on  the  NGI  program. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the high single-digit level from 2021. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be lower than 2021 levels.\n\n## Liquidity and Cash Flows\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operations. However, we also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other  trade  finance  purposes  such  as  guaranteeing  our  performance  on  particular  contracts.  We  believe  our  cash  and  cash equivalents, our expected cash flow generated from operations and our access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements and cash deployment plans over the next twelve months and beyond based on our current business plans.\n\nCash  received  from  customers,  either  from  the  payment  of  invoices  for  work  performed  or  for  advances  from  non-U.S. Government customers in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.\n\nBilling  timetables  and  payment  terms  on  our  contracts  vary  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  the  contract  type. We generally bill  and  collect  cash  more  frequently  under  cost-reimbursable  contracts,  which  represented  approximately  38%  of  the sales we recorded in 2021, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for  performance-based  payments,  which  allow  us  to  bill  and  collect  cash  as  we  perform  on  the  contract.  The  amount  of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.\n\nThe U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price  contracts,  rather  than  performance-based  payments.  In  contrast  to  negotiated  performance-based  payment  terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly as costs are incurred. In March 2020, the DoD increased the percentage rate for certain progress payments from 80% to 90%. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government changes its payment policies or decides to withhold payments  on  our  billings.  While  the  impact  of  policy  changes  or  withholding  payments  may  delay  the  receipt  of  cash,  the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary.\n\nWe have a balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and technologies through capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments. We have returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also continue to actively manage our debt levels, including maturities and interest rates, and our pension obligations. We expect to continue to opportunistically manage our pension liabilities through the purchase of group annuity contracts for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust.\n\nIn September 2021, our Board of Directors increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by $0.20 to $2.80 per share and approved a $5.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n\nAs  disclosed  in  the  'Business  Overview'  section  above,  on  December  20,  2020,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne for approximately $4.4 billion after the assumption of Aerojet Rocketdyne's then-projected net cash and are awaiting a final FTC decision. If the transaction is completed, we expect to finance the acquisition primarily through new debt issuances. Please see the 'Business Overview' above for the status of the transaction.\n\nOn August 3, 2021, we purchased group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance  company  for  approximately  18,000  U.S.  retirees  and  beneficiaries.  The  group  annuity contracts were purchased using assets from Lockheed Martin's master retirement trust and no additional funding",

The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.  Such  advances  are  not  considered  a  significant  financing  component  because  they  are  used  to  meet  working  capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  when  the  OEM  product  is  sold  for  a  loss,  but  the  combined  OEM  and  aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when  a  change  in  circumstances  warrant  a  modification  to  a  previous  estimate.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks  and  opportunities  relate  to  management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or  aircraft  landings,  and  related  variable  consideration.  Management's  judgment  related  to  these  considerations  has  become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be  performed,  the  availability  and  cost  of  materials,  the  length  of  time  to  complete  the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives  of  components,  among  others.  Cost  estimates  may  also  include  the  estimated  cost  of  satisfying  our  industrial  cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD",

The company emphasized the integrated nature of its businesses, which complicates standalone valuations. RTX also completed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2024, and concluded no adjustments were necessary, using a qualitative 'step 0' assessment to determine that it was not more likely than not that any reporting unit's fair value was below its carrying value. UPS performed its goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2024, following a managerial realignment that merged MNX Global Logistics and Marken into a single reporting unit. UPS used both qualitative and quantitative methods, including a discounted cash flow model, and found no impairment.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2024 completed as of October 1, 2024, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2024, 3M had 16 primary reporting units, with five reporting units accounting for approximately 85 percent of the goodwill. These five reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Commercial Branding and Transportation, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, and Personal Safety.\n\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M's businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M's focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M's value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\n\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2025 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\nUncertainty in Income Tax Positions: The extent of 3M's operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final tax es paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with tax ing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax  audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax  liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the ex tent to which, additional tax es will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income tax es, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 11 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company's current estimate of the tax  liabilities. If the Company's estimate of tax  liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to ex pense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax  benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Financial Condition and Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of 3M's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provide financial flexibility to deploy capital in accordance with the Company's stated priorities and meet needs associated with contractual commitments and other obligations. Investing in 3M's business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 11 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, 3M owned 19.9% of Solventum Corporation common stock which ownership interest's fair value was $2.3 billion. As previously disclosed, 3M intends to divest its ownership in Solventum within five years from its April 2024 spin-off.\n\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M's commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.8 billion commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\nTotal debt: The strength of 3M's credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company's debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio , including scheduled maturities in the next 12 months as referenced in Note 14. As of the date of this report, 3M has a credit rating of A3, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, a credit rating of BBB+, negative outlook from S&amp;P Global Ratings, and a credit rating of A-, stable outlook from Fitch.\n\nThe Company's total debt associated with continuing operations at December 31, 2024 decreased when compared to December 31, 2023 as a result of $2.9 billion in debt maturities, consisting of $1.1 billion of medium-term notes and $1.8 billion repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Amounts borrowed by Solventum during the first quarter of 2024 were a liability associated with discontinued operations and, as transferred obligations, became the sole responsibility of Solventum after the April 1, 2024 Separation, as discussed in Note 14. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following Cash Flows from Financing Activities section.",

          "chunk_text": "## UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with GAAP, including fair value measurements. We develop our estimates and judgments based on prior experience, current trends, and various other assumptions. For estimates that involve fair value measurements, we consider the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820. We also engage outside specialists as necessary to assist us in development our estimates. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following areas involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and represent critical accounting estimates.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business that result in exposure to various contingent liabilities. The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation. We apply judgment when establishing a range of reasonably possible losses arising from contingencies. Our judgment is influenced by our understanding of currently available information and potential outcomes of these actions, including the advice from our internal counsel, external counsel and other senior management.\n\nWe accrue amounts associated with judicial proceedings and other contingencies when and to the extent a loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses; however, when there appears to be a range of equally possible losses, our accrual is at the low end of this range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a reasonable estimate of the loss or a range of potential losses may not be practicable based on the information available. Additionally, events may arise that were not anticipated and, as a result, the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss that differs materially from our previously estimated liability. Ex cept as disclosed in note 10 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, contingent losses that were probable and estimable were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of, or for the year ended, December 31, 2024. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of, or for the year ended, December 31, 2024, because a loss was not reasonably estimable. Contingent obligations relating to income taxes and self-insurance are discussed below.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments\n\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of July 1, or more frequently if circumstances require. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The determination of reporting units requires judgment, and if we changed the definition of our reporting units, it is possible that we would have reached different conclusions when performing our impairment tests. Changes in our management structure or business acquisitions may result in changes to our reporting units. Based on our review of managerial realignments, which occurred as of October 1, 2024, we determined that our MNX Global Logistics and Marken businesses are now within a single operating segment and based on criteria in ASC Topic 350 also represent a single reporting unit. We performed impairment analyses as of October 1, 2024, reflective of our reporting unit structures before and after the reporting unit change, and did not identify impairment of goodwill in connection therewith.\n\nWe initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, or at our election, we quantitatively assess the fair value of a reporting unit to test goodwill for impairment. This assessment uses a combination of income and market approaches to develop an estimate of reporting unit fair value. The income and market approaches consider both entityspecific and observable market information under the fair value hierarchy in ASC Topic 820 and changes in, or additions to, available information may affect the assumptions we use in estimating fair value.\n\n- The income approach uses a discounted cash flow ('DCF') model, which requires us to make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs, capital expenditures, working capital, long-term growth rates and the cost of capital. During periods of time in which macroeconomic conditions are uncertain or volatile, these assumptions are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty. We are also required to make assumptions relating to our overall business and operating strategy, and the regulatory and market environment. Changes in any of our assumptions could significantly impact the fair value of one",

          "chunk_text": "## Safe Harbor Statement\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains v arious forward-looking statements and includes assumptions concerning Emerson's operations, future results and prospects. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later dev elopments. In connection with the 'safe harbor' prov isions of the Priv ate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson prov ides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - 'Risk Factors,' which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or ev ents to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement the Company's financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain 'non-GAAP financial measures,' as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or div estitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management's control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believ es that the following non-GAAP financial measures prov ide inv estors and analysts useful insight into the Company's financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternativ e to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nUnderlying sales, which exclude the impact of significant acquisitions, div estitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are prov ided to facilitate relev ant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact ov erall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure: net sales ).\n\nOperating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrativ e expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit div ided by net sales) are indicativ e of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to ev aluate past performance and actions required to improv e profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense, net, related party interest income, and income taxes) and total segment EBIT, and EBIT margin (defined as EBIT div ided by net sales) and total segment EBIT margin, are financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes. Adjusted EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA (defined as earnings excluding interest expense, net, related party interest income, income taxes, intangibles amortization expense, restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees, and certain gains, losses or impairments) and adjusted EBITA margin and adjusted segment EBITA margin (defined as adjusted EBITA div ided by net sales) are measures used by management to evaluate the Company's operational performance, as they exclude the impact of acquisition-related inv estments and nonoperational items. EBITDA (defined as EBIT excluding depreciation and amortization) and EBITDA margin (defined as EBITDA div ided by net sales) are also used as measures of the Company's current operating performance, as they exclude the impact of capital and acquisition-related inv estments. Adjusted EBITDA (defined as EBITDA excluding restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees, and certain gains, losses or impairments) and adjusted EBITDA margin (defined as Adjusted EBITDA div ided by net sales) are also used to exclude the impact of non-operational items. All of these are commonly used financial measures utilized by management to ev aluate performance (U.S. GAAP measures: pretax earnings or pretax profit margin, segment earnings or segment margin ).\n\nEarnings and earnings per share excluding certain gains and losses, impairments, restructuring costs, impacts of acquisitions or div estitures, amortization of intangibles, discrete taxes, or other items prov ide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items.

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) reported accounts receivable, net at $2,649 million as of December 31, 2023, showing a slight increase from $2,517 million in 2022, indicating relatively stable liquidity in collecting receivables. 3M (MMM) disclosed accounts receivable, net at $4,750 million for 2023, down from $4,532 million in 2022, suggesting a potential tightening in credit or improved collection efficiency. Union Pacific (UNP), however, showed a negative change in accounts receivable, net of $177 million in 2023, indicating a decrease in outstanding receivables during the year, which could signal improved cash collection or reduced sales on credit. Collectively, these figures suggest varying liquidity strategies and operational efficiencies across the industrials sector, with UNP showing the most pronounced cash flow improvement and MMM reflecting tighter receivables management.",

      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) maintains a conservative financial structure and has consistently met its funding requirements through strong operating cash flow ($2.9 billion annually over three years), a $3.5 billion credit facility, and efficient capital deployment, indicating confidence in sustaining liquidity for pension and other obligations. Honeywell (HON) actively manages its pension assets with a targeted asset allocation strategy across global plans, including U.S. pension plans with $17.3 billion in accumulated benefit obligation as of 2021, and adapts its non-U.S. pension investments to local regulations and funding requirements. Lockheed Martin (LMT) leverages pension risk transfer strategies, such as purchasing group annuity contracts, and benefits from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which reduced its pension funding requirements starting in 2021 and lowered CAS pension costs on government contracts beginning in 2022. These approaches highlight EMR\u2019s emphasis on liquidity and flexibility, HON\u2019s structured global asset allocation, and LMT\u2019s regulatory-driven cost mitigation and liability management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: EMR \u2192 Funding Requirements: EMR generated over $2.9 billion in annual operating cash flow for three years and maintained a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet pension and other funding obligations.",
        "Hop 2: HON \u2192 Funding Requirements: HON managed $17.3 billion in U.S. defined benefit pension obligations with a diversified asset allocation strategy and adapted non-U.S. pension investments to local funding requirements and regulations.",
        "Hop 3: LMT \u2192 Funding Requirements: LMT reduced pension funding requirements through ARPA provisions and used pension risk transfer strategies such as annuity purchases, while accelerating supplier payments using cash and progress payments."

Climate Technologies sales were $5.2 billion in 2022, an increase of $452, or 10 percent. Air conditioning, heating and refrigeration sales were strong, reflecting global demand across all end markets. Tools &amp; Home Products sales were $2.0 billion in 2022, up $128 or 7 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of professional tools and food waste disposers were strong, while wet/dry vacuums decreased moderately due to difficult comparisons. Overall, underlying sales increased 15 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 14 percent) and 11 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa increased 5 percent (China down 7 percent). Earnings were $1,440, an increase of $76, and margin was down 0.6 percentage points, as price less net material inflation was favorable but had a slightly dilutive impact on margins and higher freight and other inflation also negatively impacted margins, partially offset by leverage on higher sales and savings from cost reduction actions.\n\n2021 vs. 2020 - Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions sales were $6.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1,010, or 18 percent. Underlying sales increased 16 percent on strong global demand, as nearly all businesses achieved doubledigit growth each quarter, while foreign currency translation added 2 percent. Climate Technologies sales were $4.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $768, or 19 percent. Air conditioning and heating sales were up mid-teens, reflecting strong demand for residential-oriented products and solutions in North America and robust growth in Europe and China. Cold chain sales were up over 20 percent, driven by favorable global market conditions and strength in food retail and aftermarket. Tools &amp; Home Products sales were $1.9 billion in 2021, up $242 or 15 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of wet/dry vacuums were robust in part due to competitor outages, while sales were strong for global professional tools and solid for food waste disposers. Overall, underlying sales increased 16 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 15 percent) and 17 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa increased 17 percent (China up 17 percent). Earnings were $1,364, an increase of $246, and margin was up 0.7 percentage points, reflecting leverage on higher volume and savings from cost reduction actions, partially offset by unfavorable price-cost primarily due to steel price increases which negatively impacted the second half of the fiscal year.\n\n## Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nEmerson maintains a conservative financial structure to provide the strength and flexibility necessary to achieve our strategic objectives and has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth.\n\nEmerson is in a strong financial position, with total assets of $36 billion and stockholders' equity of $10 billion, and has the resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis.\n\nThe Company continues to generate substantial operating cash flow with over $2.9 billion in each of the last three years. Cash flows have been and are expected to be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet the Company's operating requirements, including those related to salaries and wages, working capital, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with operations. The Company also has certain contractual obligations, primarily longterm debt and operating leases (see Notes 7, 10 and 11). The Company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet its needs for the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, short- and long-term debt capacity, or its $3.5 billion revolving backup credit facility under which it has not incurred any borrowings.",

The Company's long-term target  allocations  are  as  follows:  55%-70%  fixed  income  securities  and  cash,  25%-40%  equity  securities,  5%-10%  real  estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located inside the  United  States.  Fixed  income  securities  include  corporate  bonds  of  companies  from  diversified  industries,  mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity that follow several different strategies. The Company reviews its assets on a regular basis to ensure that the Company is within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations.\n\nThe Company's non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. The Company's non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country  as  local  regulations,  funding  requirements,  and  financial  and  tax  considerations  are  part  of  the  funding  and  investment allocation process in each country.\n\nIn accordance with ASU 2015-07, 'Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)', certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

See 'Note 12 - Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  for  additional  information.  We  expect  to  continue  to  opportunistically  manage  our  pension  liabilities  through  the purchase  of  group  annuity  contracts  for  portions  of  our  outstanding  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  using  assets  from  the pension trust. Future pension risk transfer transactions could also be significant and result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust and/or require us to recognize noncash pension settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period.\n\nTo date, the effects of COVID-19 have resulted in some negative impacts on our cash flows, partially due to supplier delays. The U.S. Government has taken certain actions and enacted legislation to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on public health, the economy,  state  and  local  governments,  individuals,  and  businesses.  Since  the  pandemic  began,  Lockheed  Martin  has  remained committed to flowing down the benefits received from the DoD's modification of the progress payment rate to our supply chain partners. As of December 31, 2021, we have received approximately $1.5 billion of net accelerated progress payments, the majority of which were in 2020. We continue to use accelerated progress payments and cash on hand to accelerate payments to our suppliers. As of December 31, 2021, we have accelerated $2.2 billion of payments to our suppliers that are due by their terms in future periods.  We  will  continue  to  monitor  risk  driven  by  the  pandemic  and,  based  on  our  current  assessment,  we  will  continue  to accelerate payments to our suppliers based on risk assessed need through the end of 2022. Consistent with our current acceleration approach, we will prioritize small and COVID-19 impacted businesses.\n\nOn March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) into law. ARPA eased funding rules for single-employer defined benefit pension plans by extending the amortization of funding shortfalls and enhancing interest rate stabilization,  which  has  the  effect  of  reducing  the  funding  requirements  for  our  single-employer  defined  benefit  pension  plans beginning in 2021 and reducing the amount of CAS pension costs allocated to our U.S. Government contracts beginning in 2022. The lower pension contributions will be partially offset by lower tax deductions.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How do Caterpillar (CAT), Honeywell (HON), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) each compare in their 2023 net cash used for financing activities, and what do their respective financing strategies reveal about their capital allocation priorities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Caterpillar used $7.65 billion for financing activities, primarily driven by higher share repurchases and dividends. Honeywell used $5.76 billion, reflecting significant stock repurchases and dividend payments. Lockheed Martin used the most at $7.33 billion, largely due to $6.0 billion in share repurchases and $3.06 billion in dividends paid. These figures indicate that all three companies prioritized returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, but with differing magnitudes and emphasis. CAT and LMT focused more heavily on shareholder returns, while HON maintained a relatively lower level of financing outflows, suggesting a more conservative capital deployment approach.",

      "question": "How do Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), and Emerson (EMR) each characterize their 2023/2024 backlog levels, and what do these portrayals reveal about their respective exposure to and confidence in fulfilling long-term customer commitments in the industrials sector?",
      "answer": "Boeing reported a significant increase in backlog to $440.5 billion at year-end 2023, driven by new orders exceeding deliveries, though it faced risks from potential cancellations and delivery delays, particularly for the 737 and 777X aircraft. Caterpillar, in contrast, experienced a decline in backlog from $30.4 billion in 2022 to $27.5 billion in 2023, with a portion of $5.8 billion not expected to be fulfilled in 2024, indicating a more cautious outlook or reduced demand across its industrial segments. Emerson disclosed a backlog of $8.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, with $1.3 billion attributed to AspenTech and $400 million to National Instruments, suggesting a more diversified and software-driven backlog composition. Collectively, these figures reflect differing market dynamics: Boeing's backlog is heavily influenced by aerospace delivery risks, Caterpillar shows signs of moderating industrial demand, and Emerson highlights growth through acquisitions and software-based performance obligations.",

      "question": "How have FedEx (FDX), General Dynamics (GD), and Union Pacific (UNP) each evolved their cash dividend policies over the past three years, and what does this reveal about their differing capital allocation priorities?",
      "answer": "Over the past three years, FedEx increased its cash dividends from $3.00 per share in 2022 to $5.86 per share in 2023 before reducing it to $3.78 per share in 2024, indicating a volatile approach possibly influenced by earnings fluctuations and share repurchases. General Dynamics steadily increased its cash dividends, from $1.335 billion in 2021 to $1.448 billion in 2023, showing a consistent commitment to shareholder returns despite active share repurchases. Union Pacific also increased its dividend per share from $4.29 in 2021 to $5.08 in 2022 and further to $5.20 in 2023, reflecting a stable and growing dividend policy aligned with its strong retained earnings growth. These patterns suggest that while GD and UNP maintain disciplined, growth-oriented dividend strategies, FDX has taken a more reactive approach.",

      "question": "How do FDX, MMM, and UNP each compare in terms of their total operating lease liabilities and weighted-average discount rates for operating leases, and what might these differences suggest about their leasing strategies and cost of capital in 2022?",
      "answer": "FDX reported total operating lease liabilities of $16,930 million with a weighted-average discount rate of 2.85%, MMM had $854 million in total operating lease liabilities at a discount rate of 1.8%, and UNP disclosed $1,759 million in total operating lease liabilities (sum of current and noncurrent: $330 + $1,429) with no explicit discount rate provided. These differences suggest that FDX operates with significantly larger lease exposure than MMM or UNP, and the variation in discount rates may reflect differences in creditworthiness or lease portfolio risk profiles.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: FDX \u2192 Total Lease Liabilities: FDX disclosed $16,930 million in total operating lease liabilities and a 2.85% weighted-average discount rate, indicating a large-scale leasing strategy with moderate capital cost.",
        "Hop 2: MMM \u2192 Total Lease Liabilities: MMM reported $854 million in total operating lease liabilities with a lower 1.8% weighted-average discount rate, suggesting a smaller lease footprint but potentially better financing terms.",
        "Hop 3: UNP \u2192 Total Lease Liabilities: UNP disclosed $1,759 million in total operating lease liabilities (sum of $330M current + $1,429M noncurrent), but without a disclosed discount rate, implying a mid-sized leasing exposure without clarity on financing cost."

UNP showed a weighted average exercise price of $126.38 for exercisable options at the end of 2021. Comparing these figures, MMM had the highest average exercise price, suggesting potentially higher stock performance expectations or more recent option grants at higher strike prices.

UNP applies a 5-year smoothing mechanism to plan asset values to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, reflecting a structural approach to managing pension cost fluctuations. UPS conducts sensitivity analyses showing how small changes in assumptions like discount rates or return on assets can materially affect pension obligations and expenses, signaling a focus on proactive risk modeling. Together, these approaches show that while LMT experiences direct pension settlement costs, UNP smooths volatility through accounting methods, and UPS emphasizes predictive modeling of pension risk exposure.",

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a 5-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized in net income immediately, but are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and, if necessary, amortized as pension expense.\n\nThe components of our net periodic pension cost were as follows for the years ended  December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n\n",

      "answer": "General Dynamics recognizes actuarial losses in its annual pension and post-retirement benefit cost, which are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss. Honeywell reported $516 million in actuarial losses recognized in 2022, significantly impacting its other (income) expense line. Lockheed Martin disclosed that actuarial losses in 2023 for its pension plans were primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate, which increased benefit obligations by approximately $765 million. These differences reveal varying sensitivities to actuarial assumptions and differing levels of financial exposure tied to pension liabilities.",

(a)\n\nActuarial g ains for our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024 primarily reflect an increase in the discount rate from 5.00% at December 31, 2023 to 5.625% at December 31,  2024,  which  decreased  benefit  oblig ations  by  approx imately  $1.8  billion  offset  by  net  losses  of  approx imately  $250  million  due  to  chang es  in  demog raphic  data  and assumptions. Actuarial g ains for our retiree medical and life insurance plans in 2024 primarily reflect an increase in the discount rate from 5.00% at December 31, 2023 to 5.50% at December 31, 2024 and gains due to chang es in demog raphic data and assumptions. Actuarial losses for our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2023 primarily reflect a decrease in the discount rate from 5.25% at December 31, 2022 to 5.00% at December 31, 2023, which increased benefit oblig ations by approx imately $765 million. Actuarial losses for our retiree medical and life insurance plans in 2023 reflect a decrease in the discount rate from 5.25% at December 31, 2022 to 5.00% at December 31, 2023. (b)\n\nQualified defined benefit pension plans settlements in 2023 include $414 million in the form of lump-sum settlement payments to former employees who had not commenced receiving  their vested benefit payments. The settlement payments had no impact on year 2023 FAS pension income. (c)\n\nActual return on plan assets for our qualified defined benefit pension plans was approx imately 1% in 2024 and 7% in 2023 versus the 6.50% long -term rate of return assumption. (d)\n\nWe are required to recognize the net funded status of each postretirement benefit plan on a standalone basis as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation. Each year we measure the fair value of each plan's assets and benefit obligation on December 31, consistent with our fiscal year end. The fair value of each plan's benefit obligation reflects assumptions in effect as of the measurement date as described below. For certain of our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans the plan assets may exceed the benefit obligation, for which we recognize the net amount as an asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Conversely, for most of our qualified defined benefit pension plans the benefit obligation exceeds plan assets, for which we recognize the net amount as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet.",

      "answer": "FDX reported an actual return on plan assets of $192 million for assets held during the current year, while GD reported a much higher actual return of $1,692 million for its pension plans. HON, on the other hand, disclosed an actual return of $11 million for assets still held at year-end under U.S. plans. These differences suggest that GD's pension fund was significantly larger or performed better in 2022 compared to FDX and HON, despite the broader market volatility that likely affected HON\u2019s returns more acutely.",

      "question": "How do Caterpillar's revenue recognition criteria for machinery sales, RTX's integration risks from mergers, and UPS's historical revenue disclosures collectively shape their respective financial risk profiles related to product revenue?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's revenue recognition policy for machinery sales hinges on transfer of control, which occurs either at shipment or destination country border, depending on whether the product is exported. This approach introduces revenue timing risks tied to logistics and customer creditworthiness. RTX, on the other hand, highlights that integration challenges from the Raytheon merger\u2014such as delays, increased costs, and unforeseen expenses\u2014could materially impact its ability to achieve expected revenue synergies and cost savings, thus introducing strategic execution risk. UPS provides historical revenue by product type, though specific figures are not listed in the excerpt, the existence of such segmented revenue data allows for trend analysis and risk assessment across its logistics segments. Together, these disclosures reveal distinct risk profiles: Caterpillar faces operational and credit risk in revenue recognition, RTX faces integration and execution risk from strategic mergers, and UPS faces market and volume risk reflected in its product-specific revenue trends.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## B. Accounting standards issued but not yet adopted\n\nWe consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs. We assessed ASUs not listed above and determined that they either were not applicable or were not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n## 2.     Sales and revenue recognition\n\n## A. Sales of Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation\n\nWe recognize sales of ME&amp;T when all the following criteria are satisfied: (i) a contract with an independently owned and operated dealer or an end user exists which has commercial substance; (ii) it is probable we will collect the amount charged to the dealer or end user; and (iii) we have completed our performance obligation whereby the dealer or end user has obtained control of the product. A contract with commercial substance exists once we receive and accept a purchase order under a dealer sales agreement, or once we enter into a contract with an end user. If collectibility is not probable, the sale is deferred and not recognized until collection is probable or payment is received. Control of our products typically transfers when title and risk of ownership of the product has transferred to the dealer or end user. Typically, where product is produced and sold in the same country,  title  and  risk  of  ownership  transfer  when  we  ship  the  product.  Products  that  are  exported  from  a  country  for  sale typically transfer title and risk of ownership at the border of the destination country.\n\nOur remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the remanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related products.  In this business, we inspect, clean and remanufacture used engines and related components (core).  In connection with the sale of our remanufactured product to dealers, we collect a deposit that is repaid if the dealer returns an acceptable core within a specified time period.  Caterpillar owns and has title to the cores when they are returned from dealers.  The rebuilt engine or component (the core plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product to dealers and end users. We recognize revenue pursuant to the same transfer of control criteria as ME&amp;T sales noted above.  At the time of sale, we recognize the deposit in Other current liabilities in Statement 3, and we recognize the core to be returned as an asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 at the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience with usable cores).  Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay the deposit and relieve the liability.  We then transfer the returned core asset into inventory. In the event that the deposit is forfeited (i.e., upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the specified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost of the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively.\n\nWe provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products.  The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end  user.    Generally,  we  estimate  the  cost  of  these  discounts  for  each  product  by  model  by  geographic  region  based  on historical experience and known changes in merchandising programs. We report the cost of these discounts as a reduction to the transaction price when we recognize the product sale. We accrue a corresponding post-sale discount reserve in Statement 3, which  represents  discounts  we  expect  to  pay  on  units  sold.  If  discounts  paid  differ  from  those  estimated,  we  report  the difference as a change in the transaction price.\n\nExcept for replacement parts, no right of return exists on the sale of our products.  We estimate replacement part returns based on historical experience and recognize a parts return asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3, which represents  our  right  to  recover  replacement  parts  we  expect  will  be  returned. We  also  recognize  a  refund  liability  in  Other current liabilities in Statement 3 for the refund we expect to pay for returned parts. If actual replacement part returns differ from those estimated, we recognize the difference in the estimated replacement part return asset and refund liability in Cost of goods sold and Sales, respectively.",

We  also  implement  from  time  to  time  restructuring  plans,  which include or may result in workforce reductions, global facility reductions, procurement cost reduction activities, legal entity and operational reorganizations and other cost reduction initiatives. These strategic activities are complex and require the investment of resources including in personnel and systems. If we do not successfully manage our current or future strategic initiatives, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. In addition, certain U.S. government contracts and programs have begun to require digital engineering and other digital capabilities, and our inability to achieve these capabilities with respect to these programs timely may result in loss of revenues. Risks associated with workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages. Any of the above factors may impair our ability to achieve anticipated benefits, or otherwise  harm  our  business,  or  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  competitive  position,  results  of  operations,  financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWe May Be Unable to Successfully Integrate the Legacy Businesses of United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and Raytheon and Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Raytheon Merger. The success of the Raytheon Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate UTC and Raytheon Company's legacy businesses, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities (including technology-driven revenue synergies) and operational efficiencies  from  the  Raytheon  Merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers.\n\nWe may face material challenges to the continued integration of the two companies, including, without limitation:\n\n- maintaining employee morale, retaining key management and other employees, and managing corporate culture;\n- retaining  existing  business  and  operational  relationships,  including  customers,  suppliers  and  employees  and  other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n- identifying and achieving revenue synergy opportunities among the legacy businesses; and\n- consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems.\n\nThe impact and extent of these challenges is uncertain and many of them have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Any one  of  them  could  result  in  delays,  increased  costs,  decreases  in  the  amount  of  expected  revenues,  reduced  expected  cash generation,  and  diversion  of  management's  time  and  energy,  which  could  materially  affect  our  financial  condition,  results  of operations  and  liquidity.  In  addition,  we  must  continue  to  manage  the  integration  of  other  companies,  assets  and  businesses, including  the  integration  of  Rockwell  Collins,  which  UTC  acquired  on  November  26,  2018.  These  ongoing  (and  future) integrations  may  increase  the  complexity  of,  and  challenges  associated  with,  the  integration  of  UTC  and  Raytheon  Company's legacy businesses, which may make it more difficult for us to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Raytheon Merger fully, or within  the  anticipated  time  frame. The  actual  integration  may  result  in  additional  and  unforeseen  expenses,  and  the  anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, many of the expenses that may be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately, and changes to the estimates could affect the total amount or timing of integration expenses. These expenses could exceed benefits expected to be realized in connection with the Raytheon Merger.\n\nIf  We  Fail  to  Manage  Potential  Future  Acquisitions,  Investments,  Divestitures,  Joint  Ventures  and  Other  Transactions Successfully,  These Activities  Could  Adversely  Affect  Our  Future  Financial  Results. In  pursuing  our  business  strategies,  we continually  review,  evaluate  and  consider  potential  investments,  acquisitions,  divestitures,  joint  ventures  and  other  teaming  and collaborative  arrangements.

(Spirit) subjects us to various risks and uncertainties, including risks that we may not complete the acquisition or realize the anticipated benefits in the expected timeframe or at all.\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) to acquire Spirit in an all-stock transaction that will include the assumption of Spirit's net debt at closing. Completion of our acquisition of Spirit is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. On January 31, 2025, Spirit's stockholders approv ed the Merger Agreement and the related transactions. Some of the remaining conditions, such as certain regulatory approv als and the ability of Spirit to enter into definitiv e agreements relating to the disposition of Spirit operations related to certain Airbus commercial work packages and consummate the related transactions, are beyond our control, which make the completion of our acquisition of Spirit  (and  the  timing  thereof)  uncertain.  In  addition,  if  Spirit  or  Boeing  exercise  certain  termination  rights  included  in  the  Merger  Agreement,  the acquisition will not be consummated. Furthermore, the gov ernmental authorities from which regulatory approv als related to the acquisition are required may impose burdensome or unacceptable conditions on the completion of the acquisition, require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement, or prev ent or delay the consummation of the acquisition. If the acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business may be adv ersely affected and we will be subject to a number of risks, including expenditure of time and resources, negativ e reactions from stakeholders, and potential stock price fluctuations. If we are successful in completing the acquisition, we will be subject to other risks, including those related to the assumption of Spirit's net debt and other obligations at closing, which could adv ersely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Difficulties in integrating Spirit may result in the failure to realize anticipated benefits of the acquisition (including anticipated synergies and quality improv ements) in the expected timeframe or at all, as well as operational challenges, the div ersion of management's attention from other ongoing business concerns, and unforeseen expenses, which may  have  an  adv erse  impact  on  our  operations  and  our  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows.  For  additional  information  on  the acquisition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint v entures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions, including our acquisition of Spirit, and related activ ities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and serv ice portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adv ersely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, cybersecurity issues or v ulnerabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint v entures could also impact our reported results of operations  or  financial  position.  We  also  may  make  strategic  div estitures  from  time  to  time.  T hese  transactions  may  result  in  continued  financial inv olv ement in the div ested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Our estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our assets may be at risk of future impairment.\n\nThe accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables. For example, accounting for sales using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires that we assess risks and make assumptions regarding future schedule, cost, technical and performance issues for thousands of contracts, many of which are long-term in nature. This process can be especially difficult when estimating costs for  development programs because of the inherent uncertainty in developing a new product or technology.  Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for our contracts, materially different amounts of revenue and operating profit could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we initially allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses based on a preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For acquisitions we may use a one-year measurement period to analyze and assess several factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition date which could result in adjustments to asset and liability balances.\n\nWe have $11.1 billion of goodwill assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 from previous acquisitions, which represents approximately 20% of our total assets. These goodwill assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill may be impaired. If we experience changes or factors arise that negatively affect the expected cash flows of a reporting unit, we may be required to write off all or a portion of the reporting unit's related goodwill assets.\n\nActual financial results could differ from our judgments and estimates. See 'Critical Accounting Policies' in the MD&amp;A and Results of Operations and 'Note 1 Organization  and  Significant  Accounting  Policies'  included  in  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a  complete  discussion  of  our  significant accounting policies and use of estimates.\n\n## Changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax  laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, could result in increases in our tax  ex pense and affect profitability and cash flows. For ex ample, beginning in 2022, the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes (research and development capitalization). While the most significant impact of this provision was to cash tax liability for 2022, the tax year in which the provision took effect, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but decline to an immaterial amount in year six .\n\nThe  amount  of  net  deferred  tax   assets  will  change  periodically  based  on  several  factors,  including  the  measurement  of  our  postretirement  benefit  plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions, and future changes in tax laws. In addition, we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities. The final resolution of tax audits and any related administrative reviews or litigation could result in unanticipated increases in our tax  ex pense and changes to the timing of required tax  payments, which could affect profitability  and  cash  flows  for  any  particular  reporting  period.  These  increases  or  changes  could  have  a  material  impact  on  financial  condition  and  results  of operations in such period.\n\n## Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance.\n\nA significant  portion  of  our  business  relates  to  designing,  developing  and  manufacturing  advanced  defense  and  technology  products  and  systems.  New technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive loss of life or property damage. Accordingly, we may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some but not all circumstances, we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers, either through U.S. G overnment indemnifications under Public Law 85-804, 10 U.S.C. 3861, the Commercial Space Launch Act or the PriceAnderson Act, qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY  Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, contractual provisions or otherwise.\n\nWe seek to obtain insurance coverage from established and reputable insurance carriers to the extent available in order to cover these risks and liabilities. However, the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain or that is available to purchase in the market may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities and we may self-insure certain types of risk. Insurance coverage is subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance contract and is further subject to any sublimits, exclusions, restrictions, or defenses, including standard exclusions for acts of war. Ex isting coverage is renewed annually and may be canceled pursuant to the terms of the policies while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks, natural hazards and liabilities.

          "chunk_text": "Operational execution - Operational challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company's financial results depend on the successful execution of our businesses' operating plans across all steps of the product and service lifecycle. We continue working to improve the operations and execution of our businesses and our ability to make the desired improvements will be a significant factor in our overall financial performance. We also face operational risks in connection with launching or ramping new product platforms, such as the Haliade-X offshore wind turbine or the Cypress onshore wind turbine at Renewable Energy, or the LEAP engine at Aviation. With significant new product platforms and technologies, our businesses seek to reduce the costs of these products over time with experience, and risks related to our supply chain, product quality, timely delivery or other aspects of operational execution can adversely affect our profit margins or free cash flow. Operational failures at any of our businesses that result in quality problems or potential product, environmental, health or safety risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. In addition, a portion of our business, particularly within our Power and Renewable Energy businesses, involves large projects where we take on, or are members of a consortium responsible for, the full scope of engineering, procurement, construction or other services. These types of projects often pose unique risks related to their location, scale, complexity, duration and pricing or payment structure. Performance issues or schedule delays can arise due to inadequate technical expertise, unanticipated project modifications, developments at project sites, environmental, health and safety issues, execution by or coordination with suppliers, subcontractors or consortium partners, financial difficulties of our customers or significant partners or compliance with government regulations, and these can lead to cost overruns, contractual penalties, liquidated damages and other adverse consequences. Where GE is a member of a consortium, we are typically subject to claims based on joint and several liability, and claims can extend to aspects of the project or costs that are not directly related or limited to GE's scope of work or over which GE does not have control. Operational, quality or other issues at large projects, or across our projects portfolio more broadly, can adversely affect GE's business, reputation or results of operations.\n\nProduct safety - Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, and a major failure or similar event affecting our products or third-party products with which our products are integrated can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services for both our own and third-party products that incorporate or use complex or leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Many of our products and services involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure projects, such as commercial jet engines, gas turbines, onshore and offshore wind turbines or nuclear power generation, and accordingly the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant. In particular, actual or perceived design or production issues related to new product introductions or relatively new product lines can result in significant reputational harm to our businesses, in addition to direct warranty, maintenance and other costs that may arise. A significant product issue resulting in injuries or death, widespread outages, a fleet grounding or similar systemic consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. In some circumstances, we have and in the future we may continue to incur increased costs, delayed payments or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party's product with which our products are integrated, or if parts or other components that we incorporate in our products have defects or other quality issues. There can be no assurance that the operational processes around product design, manufacture, performance and servicing that we or our customers or other third parties have designed to meet rigorous quality standards will be sufficient to prevent us or our customers or other third parties from experiencing operational process or product failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cyber-attacks or other intentional acts, software vulnerabilities or malicious software, that could result in potential product, safety, quality, regulatory or environmental risks.\n\nCybersecurity - Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks such as ransomware, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to the security of GE's and its customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' infrastructure, products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of GE's and its customers' data. As the perpetrators of such attacks become more capable (including sophisticated state or state-affiliated actors), and as critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. A significant cyber-related attack in one of our industries, even if such an attack does not involve GE products, services or systems, could pose broader disruptions and adversely affect our business. We have also observed an increase in thirdparty breaches and ransomware attacks at suppliers, service providers and software providers, and our efforts to mitigate adverse effects on GE if this trend continues may be less successful in the future. The increasing degree of interconnectedness between GE and its partners, suppliers and customers also poses a risk to the security of GE's network as well as the larger ecosystem in which GE operates. There can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, performing security reviews and requiring business partners with connections to the GE network to appropriately secure their information technology systems, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, will be sufficient to prevent, detect and limit the impact of cyber-related attacks, and we remain vulnerable to known or unknown threats. In addition to existing risks, the adoption of new technologies in the future may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breaches and failures. While we have developed secure development lifecycle design practices to secure our software designs and connected products, an unknown vulnerability or compromise could potentially impact the security of GE's software or connected products and lead to the loss of GE intellectual property, misappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal data, safety risks or unavailability of equipment. We also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we have vulnerability to security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to material compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems,",

The  increase  was  primarily attributable to higher product costs of approximately $560 million at RMS due to higher production volume on various Sikorsky helicopter programs and for TLS programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system; $435 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume on classified contracts and F-16 production contracts, partially offset by lower volume on F-35 development contracts; $345 million at MFC due to higher volume on PAC-3, LRASM and JASSM programs; partially offset by lower product costs of approximately $65 million at Space due to the renationalization of AWE, partially offset by higher volume on hypersonic development, Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) programs.\n\n## Service Costs\n\nService  costs  increased  approximately  $92  million,  or  1%,  in  2021  compared  to  2020.  The  increase  in  service  costs  was primarily  due  to  higher  service  costs  of  approximately  $85  million  at Aeronautics  due  to  higher  sustainment  volume  on  F-35, partially offset by lower sustainment volume on F-22.\n\n## Severance and Restructuring Charges\n\nDuring  2021,  we  recorded  severance  and  restructuring  charges  of  $36  million  ($28  million,  or  $0.10  per  share,  after-tax) associated  with  plans  to  close  and  consolidate  certain  facilities  and  reduce  total  workforce  within  our  RMS  business  segment. During 2020, we recorded severance charges totaling $27 million ($21 million, or $0.08 per share, after-tax) related to the planned elimination of certain positions primarily at our corporate functions.\n\n## Other Unallocated, Net\n\nOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment (which represents the difference between CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments' results of operations and the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income), stock-based compensation expense and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.8 billion in 2021,  compared  to  $1.7  billion  in  2020.  Other  unallocated,  net  during  2021  was  higher  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  our FAS/CAS operating adjustment and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant.  See  'Business  Segment  Results  of  Operations'  and  'Critical  Accounting  Policies  -  Postretirement  Benefit  Plans' discussion below for more information on our pension cost.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net generally includes earnings generated by equity method investees. Other income, net in 2021 was $62 million, compared to other expense, net of $10 million in 2020. Other income, net in 2021 included lower earnings generated by  equity  method  investments;  however,  other  expense,  net  in  2020  included  a  noncash  impairment  charge  of  $128  million ($96  million ,  or $0.34  per  share,  after-tax)  related  to  our  previous  investment  in Advanced  Military  Maintenance,  Repair  and Overhaul Center (AMMROC), which was sold in 2020. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest  expense  in  2021  was  $569  million,  compared  to  $591  million  in  2020.  The  decrease  in  interest  expense  in  2021 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of debt in October 2020 and September 2021 of $500 million each. See 'Capital Structure, Resources and Other' included within 'Liquidity and Cash Flows' discussion below and 'Note 11 - Debt' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.\n\n## Non-Service FAS Pension (Expense) Income\n\nNon-service FAS pension expense was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to income of $219 million in 2020. Non-service FAS pension expense in 2021 includes a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax), related  to  the  transfer  of  $4.9  billion  of  our  gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance company. See 'Note 12 - Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is 3M's incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\n\nAs a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3M's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nCertain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend the lease term up to five years. 3M includes options to renew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, 3M is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.\n\nFor the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3M groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used beyond their noncancellable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, additional payments related to a subsequent adjustment in an inflation index, and payments for non-components such as sales tax. Certain 3M leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle for Determining Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Plan Cost\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, 3M changed the method it uses to calculate the market-related value of fixed income securities included in its pension and other postretirement plan assets. The market-related value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of net unamortized actuarial gains or losses expense components of net periodic benefit cost. The Company previously used the calculated value approach for all plan assets, deferring over three years the impact on these amounts of asset gains or losses that differed from expected returns. 3M changed to the fair value approach for calculating market-related value for the fixed income class of plan assets, which does not involve deferring the impact of excess plan asset gains or losses in the determination of these two components of net periodic benefit cost. 3M considers the use of the fair value approach preferable to the calculated value approach as it results in a more current reflection of impacts of changes in value of these plan assets in the determination of net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, given the plans' liability-driven investment strategy whereby the changes in value of the fixed income plan assets should offset changes in the value of the plans' liabilities, this approach more closely aligns the expected return on plan assets expense component with the value reflected in the plans' funded status. This change was applied retrospectively to all periods presented within 3M's financial statements. The change did not impact consolidated operating income or net cash provided by operating activities but did impact the previously reported portion of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit) that was included within non-operating other expense (income) along with related consolidated income items such as net income and earnings per share. Other impacts included related changes to previously reported consolidated other comprehensive income, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and associated line items within the determination of net cash provided by operating activities. For classes of plan assets other than fixed income investments, the Company continues to use the calculated value approach to determine their market-related value.",

      "answer": "MMM quantifies its pension expense directly, reporting $206 million in 2021, and also shows pension contributions of $180 million in the same year, indicating active cash outflows to support pension obligations. UNP explains that its pension expense is calculated using service cost, interest cost, and expected returns on plan assets, with a smoothing mechanism that applies the expected return over a 5-year period to reduce volatility. UPS, instead of reporting specific pension expense figures, provides a sensitivity analysis showing how small changes in assumptions (e.g., a 25 basis point shift in discount rate or return on assets) could materially affect pension obligations and expenses. Together, these approaches show that MMM focuses on direct disclosure of expense and contributions, UNP emphasizes methodological consistency and smoothing, and UPS prioritizes risk sensitivity and assumption-based planning in pension liability management.",

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a 5-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized in net income immediately, but are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and, if necessary, amortized as pension expense.\n\nThe components of our net periodic pension cost were as follows for the years ended  December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n\n",

      "answer": "Boeing reports a significant drop in its expected cash outflows by 2026, with only $799 million in obligations compared to $2,105 million in 2025, suggesting a de-leveraging or reduced capital expenditure trajectory. FedEx discloses $1,919 million in facility and equipment obligations for 2026 under operating leases, indicating continued investment in logistics infrastructure. Honeywell shows a steady decline in its postretirement benefit obligations, with $13 million due in 2026 net of Medicare subsidies, reflecting mature benefit programs and stable long-term liabilities. Together, these figures highlight Boeing's focus on reducing near-term financial commitments, FedEx's ongoing reliance on leased assets to support operations, and Honeywell's stable legacy cost structure.",

In contrast, MMM discloses $837 million in 'Other operating expenses' for 2024, a significant reduction from $3,016 million in 2023, indicating a major cost-cutting shift, likely tied to its discontinued operations. UPS separately reports 'Total other expenses' at $109 million in 2024, a modest increase from $98 million in 2023, but highlights transformation strategy costs at $322 million after-tax, pointing to ongoing restructuring efforts.

      "answer": "Boeing emphasizes a strategic asset allocation approach aimed at reducing volatility relative to pension liabilities, with a focus on diversification and de-risking through reallocation to fixed income as funded status improves. Emerson Electric reports pension assets as part of its noncurrent assets, listing them alongside other long-term items like operating lease ROU assets and deferred taxes, without detailing specific allocation or strategy. UPS provides granular detail on pension asset valuation, including the use of NAV as a practical expedient for investments in hedge funds, private equity, and real estate, valued at $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, and highlights sensitivity to assumptions in estimating these values. Together, these disclosures reveal differing levels of transparency and strategic emphasis: Boeing focuses on dynamic asset allocation, Emerson provides minimal disclosure, and UPS emphasizes valuation complexity and sensitivity.",

Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.\n\nWe periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. A key element of our strategy is to de-risk the plan as the funded status of the plan increases. During 2021, as the funded status of the plans increased, certain assets were reallocated to fixed income. The  changes  in  the  asset  allocation  are  reflected  in  the  asset  allocation  table  below.  We  identify  investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy  changes,  market  value  fluctuations,  the  length  of  time  it  takes  to  fully  implement  investment  allocation positions,  and  the  timing  of  benefit  payments  and  contributions.  Short-term  investments  and  exchange-traded derivatives  are  used  to  rebalance  the  actual  asset  allocation  to  the  target  asset  allocation.  The  asset  allocation  is monitored  and  rebalanced  frequently.  The  actual  and  target  allocations  by  asset  class  for  the  pension  assets  at December 31 were as follows:\n\n",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nAsset groups represent the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified. Determining the asset group requires judgment and changes in the way asset groups are defined could have material impact to the results of impairment testing. We perform recoverability testing by comparing the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as appropriate. Details of long-lived asset impairments are included in note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nIn the normal course of business, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk, including derivatives, marketable securities, finance receivables, pension assets, other investments and debt. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, principally derivatives, marketable securities, pension assets and certain other investments. These financial instruments are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis based upon a fair value hierarchy (Levels 1, 2 and 3). Fair values are based on listed market prices (Level 1), when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations (Level 2). If listed market prices or other relevant factors are not available, inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability (Level 3). Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, foreign currency exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Further information on our accounting polices relating to fair value measurements can be found in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the majority of our financial instruments were categorized as either Level 1 or Level 2. Refer to notes 3, 10 and 18 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on these instruments. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk section of this report.\n\nWithin our pension assets, we hold investments in hedge, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate funds which are primarily measured using net asset value (\"NAV\") as a practical expedient for fair value, as appropriate. These investments were valued at $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. In order to estimate NAV, we evaluate audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers and make adjustments for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these assumptions. If our estimates of activity changed, this could have a material impact on the reported value of these investments and on the return on assets that we report. Refer to note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension assets.\n\nCertain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property, plant, and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. These assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of an impairment or when an asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale.\n\nIn accounting for business acquisitions, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment, especially with respect to identified intangible assets as there may be limited or no observable transactions within the market, requiring us to develop internal models to estimate fair value. For example, estimating the fair value of identified intangible assets may require us to develop valuation assumptions, including but not limited to, future expected cash flows from identified intangible assets, synergies and the cost of capital. Certain inputs require us to determine assumptions that are reflective of a market participant view of fair value. Changes in any of these assumptions may materially impact the amount we recognize for identifiable assets and liabilities, in addition to the residual amount allocated to goodwill.",

      "question": "How have Boeing, FedEx, and Union Pacific each quantified or disclosed the financial impact of fuel price fluctuations in their 2023 filings, and what does this reveal about their exposure management strategies?",
      "answer": "Boeing indirectly highlights its sensitivity to fuel prices by noting the airline industry's vulnerability to fuel price spikes, which directly affects its commercial aircraft demand outlook. FedEx does not provide specific financial disclosures about fuel price exposure in the provided evidence, suggesting limited transparency or a less direct impact on its operations. Union Pacific explicitly quantifies the impact, reporting that fuel surcharge revenues decreased by $0.7 billion in 2023 due to a 15% drop in fuel prices and lower volume. This comparative analysis reveals that Boeing's exposure is demand-driven through its airline customers, FedEx appears to manage exposure internally without explicit disclosure, and Union Pacific directly ties a significant portion of its freight revenues to fuel price movements through surcharge mechanisms.",

RTX shows a much larger noncurrent liability of $1,737 million tied to its pension obligations, signaling a more substantial long-term burden.

      "answer": "In 2024, Boeing reported a total deferred tax expense of ($302), driven primarily by a U.S. state deferred tax expense of ($234). General Dynamics, in contrast, reported a much lower total deferred tax expense of ($86), with a significant reduction in U.S. federal deferred tax expenses compared to previous years. UPS showed a minimal total deferred tax expense of ($15), with a notable decline in U.S. federal deferred tax contributions from prior years. These differences suggest that Boeing is facing more significant state-level tax pressures, General Dynamics is benefiting from a declining federal tax burden, and UPS is experiencing a near-neutral deferred tax position, possibly reflecting strategic tax planning or changes in its asset base.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin faces cost structure risks due to its heavy reliance on fixed-price contracts, which expose the company to cost overruns and potential reach-forward losses, especially in complex development programs. Raytheon Technologies actively manages its cost structure through restructuring actions, including workforce reductions and facility exits, while also adjusting for pension-related FAS/CAS differences to maintain competitiveness. Union Pacific aims to lower its overall cost structure by improving network fluidity, optimizing resource utilization, and investing in safety and predictive technologies to reduce service interruptions and operating variability. When combined, these approaches show that Lockheed Martin prioritizes contract risk mitigation, Raytheon focuses on operational restructuring and accounting alignment, and Union Pacific emphasizes efficiency and safety-driven cost optimization \u2014 each tailored to their industry-specific challenges in defense and rail logistics.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, suppliers sold them $545 and $639 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations. Amounts due to suppliers that participate in the SCF program may be reflected in cash flows from operating activities or cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The amounts settled through the SCF program were approximately $1.7 and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $3.1 billion of our total worldwide holdings of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business. Cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases, pension contributions and dividend payments to shareowners. All cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the U.S. without any U.S. federal income taxes. Any such distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and U.S. state taxes. When amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested, no accrual for taxes is provided.",

      "answer": "FedEx emphasizes its ability to manage its cost structure to match shifting volume levels, which is a key indicator for understanding its operating results. Lockheed Martin faces significant risks from cost overruns under fixed-price contracts, which can reduce margins or lead to reach-forward losses if actual costs exceed estimates. UPS adjusts elements of its cost structure in response to economic and regulatory conditions, particularly highlighting the impact of employee health, retiree benefits, and insurance costs on its financial performance. Together, these companies reveal differing exposures and strategies around cost structure: FedEx focuses on operational flexibility, Lockheed Martin on contract risk mitigation, and UPS on regulatory and labor cost adjustments.",

GD highlights that its corporate operating costs consist primarily of equity-based compensation expense, suggesting a strategic emphasis on aligning executive incentives with performance while managing other overhead costs. LMT excludes a portion of corporate costs from its business segment operating profit, noting that these costs are not considered allowable or allocable under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which reflects a structuring of costs to align with contract compliance and segment performance evaluation. Together, these perspectives reveal differing strategies: CAT focuses on reducing absolute corporate costs, GD emphasizes compensation structuring, and LMT aligns costs with regulatory and contract requirements.",

In addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans and the change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. In 2024, research and development capitalization resulted in a cash tax liability of approximately $370 million and our net deferred tax assets increased by a similar amount. While the largest impact of this provision was to the 2022 cash tax liability, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but will decrease over the period and be immaterial by 2027.\n\nWe are regularly  under  audit  or  ex amination  by  tax   authorities,  including  foreign  tax   authorities  (Australia,  Canada,  India,  Italy,  Japan,  Poland,  the  United Kingdom, and other countries). The final resolution of tax audits and any related administrative reviews or litigation could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and changes to the timing of required tax payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These increases or changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15% applied on a country-by-country basis for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar 2), with certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects effective January 1, 2025. While the United States has not enacted legislation to adopt Pillar 2 and it is uncertain if it will do so in the future, certain countries in which we operate have enacted such legislation, and other countries are in the process of doing so. We do not expect Pillar 2 to have a material impact on our effective tax  rate or our financial condition and results of operation.\n\n## Net Earnings\n\nWe reported net earnings of $5.3 billion ($22.31 per share) in 2024 and $6.9 billion ($27.55 per share) in 2023. Net earnings and earnings per share in 2024 were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 12.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2024 compared to 2023. The reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.\n\n## Business Segment Results of Operations\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.\n\nNet sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and thus are not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.\n\nBusiness segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. G overnment under the applicable U.S. G overnment Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) or portions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and other items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.",

      "question": "How did GD's reliance on leased machinery and equipment in 2021 compare to HON's owned machinery and equipment and RTX's mix of owned and leased productive assets, and what might this reveal about their respective capital structure strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2021, GD disclosed that machinery and equipment comprised a portion of its lease obligations, with real estate representing over 75% of its lease obligations, indicating a preference for leasing non-real estate assets. In contrast, HON reported $10,143 million in owned machinery and equipment, showing a significant investment in fixed assets. RTX, on the other hand, reported that approximately 30% of its 75 million square feet of productive space, which includes machinery and equipment, was leased, while 70% was owned. This reveals differing capital strategies: GD appears to rely more on leasing for flexibility, HON maintains a high level of ownership in machinery, and RTX balances ownership and leasing. These differences may affect their capital flexibility and financial ratios, with HON carrying more long-term asset value while GD and RTX may have more variable cost structures through leasing.",

When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we include the impact of the option in the lease term for purposes of determining total future lease payments. As most of our lease agreements do not explicitly state the discount rate implicit in the lease, we use our incremental borrowing rate on the commencement date to calculate the present value of future payments.\n\nOur leases commonly include payments that are based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other similar indices. These variable lease payments are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Other variable lease payments, such as usage-based amounts, are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability, and are expensed as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments, the calculation of the ROU asset also includes any deferred rent, lease pre-payments and initial direct costs of obtaining the lease, such as commissions.\n\nIn addition to the base rent, real estate leases typically contain provisions for common-area maintenance and other similar services, which are considered non-lease components for accounting purposes. For our real estate leases, we apply a practical expedient to include these non-lease components in calculating the ROU asset and lease liability. For all other types of leases, non-lease components are excluded from our ROU assets and lease liabilities and expensed as incurred.\n\nOur  leases  are  for  office  space,  manufacturing  facilities,  and  machinery  and  equipment.  Real  estate represents over 75% of our lease obligations.\n\nThe components of lease costs were as follows:\n\n",

To  preserve  the  tax-free  treatment  of  the  Distributions,  we  may  be  limited  in  our  ability  to  pursue  certain  equity issuances, strategic transactions, repurchases, or other transactions (including certain dispositions of assets) that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business.\n\nIf Either Distribution, Together with Certain Related Transactions, Were to Fail to Qualify as a Transaction that is Generally Tax-Free, Including as a Result of Subsequent Acquisitions of Our Stock (Including Pursuant to the Raytheon Merger) or the Stock of Carrier or Otis, We Could Be Subject to Significant Tax Liabilities. We received (1) a private letter ruling from the Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  regarding  certain  U.S.  federal  income  tax  matters  relating  to  the  Separation  Transactions  and Distributions  and  (2)  an  opinion  of  outside  counsel  regarding  the  qualification  of  certain  elements  of  the  Distributions  under Section 355 of the Code. Although we intend for the Distributions generally to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that they will so qualify. Even if the Distributions were to otherwise qualify as tax-free transactions under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, either Distribution or both Distributions may result in taxable gain to us (but not our stockholders)  under  Section  355(e)  of  the  Code  if  such  Distribution(s)  were  deemed  to  be  part  of  a  plan  (or  series  of  related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable. If the IRS were to determine that any post-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier  stock,  Otis  stock,  or  our  stock,  as  applicable,  pursuant  to  such  a  plan  (when  aggregated  with  any  pre-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan) would represent a 50% or greater interest  in  shares  of  Carrier,  Otis,  or  us,  as  applicable,  such  determination  could  result  in  significant  tax  liabilities  to  us.  For purposes of this test, even if the Raytheon Merger were treated as part of such plan, it did not result in an acquisition of a 50% or greater interest in our shares pursuant to a plan. Any such tax liabilities imposed on us may adversely affect an investment in us. In addition, with respect to certain Separation Transactions, we obtained tax rulings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or opinions of external tax advisors, in each case, regarding the tax treatment of such Separation Transactions. Notwithstanding the receipt of such tax rulings and opinions, there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant Separation Transactions differs from the conclusions reached therein. In the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant Separation Transaction, we would be subject to significant tax liabilities, which may adversely  affect  an  investment  in  us.  Further,  under  a  tax  matters  agreement  that  we  entered  into  with  Carrier  and  Otis  in connection with the Separation Transactions and Distributions, each of Carrier and Otis generally is required to indemnify us for any  taxes  we  incur  resulting  from  the  Separation  Transactions  and/or  the  Distributions  to  the  extent  such  amounts  result  from certain disqualifying actions by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier or Otis, as applicable. Further, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is generally required to indemnify us for a specified portion of any taxes we incur (a) arising as a result of the failure of either of the Distributions and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree or a failure of any Separation Transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to so qualify, in each case, to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier, Otis, or us or (b) arising from certain audit or other adjustments to tax liabilities incurred with respect to Separation Transactions that were not intended to qualify as tax-free. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is responsible for (i) a specified portion of any installment payment we are required to make pursuant to Section 965(h)(2) of the Code and (ii) specified taxes that exclusively relate to the Carrier business or the Otis business, as applicable. The amount of any such taxes for which we would be responsible may be significant, and if we were unable to obtain indemnification payments from Carrier or Otis to which we are entitled under the tax matters agreement and/or other agreements entered into in connection with the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, we would incur significant losses.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) faced significant margin pressure due to production quality issues on the 787 Program, which introduced uncertainty in revenue forecasts and potential reach-forward losses. Emerson (EMR) experienced a margin turnaround from (2.3)% in 2021 to 1.9% in 2022, indicating early-stage recovery in profitability despite ongoing challenges. General Dynamics (GD) explained that margins in both its Aerospace and defense segments are influenced by production efficiencies, program maturity, and contract performance, with new programs typically showing lower initial margins. Together, these insights reveal differing operational risk profiles: BA's margin volatility is tied to regulatory and delivery delays, EMR shows early margin recovery amid restructuring, and GD emphasizes cost control and contract lifecycle dynamics.",

The  Company  uses program  accounting  in  order  to  compute  cost  of  sales  and  margin  for  each  commercial  airplane  sold.  The  use  of program accounting requires estimating the revenue expected to be earned upon delivery of the aircraft included in the program's  accounting  quantity.  The  timing  of  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration's  ('FAA')  approval  to  resume deliveries, the impact to the delivery schedule from delayed deliveries, and the value of the consideration expected to be  provided  to  customers  for  delivery  delays  are  key  factors  that  affect  estimated  revenue.  There  is  increased estimation  uncertainty  related  to  the  revenue  forecasts  of  aircraft  which  have  reached  or  are  expected  to  reach  a delivery delay period that provides the customer with a contractual termination right. Due to continued uncertainty in the expected FAA approval date to resume 787 aircraft deliveries, there is significant judgment in determining which aircraft will  reach  these  contractual  termination  rights.  Changes  to  the  expected  delivery  resumption  date  could  have  a flowthrough impact and result in additional consideration to customers. This could result in lower margins or further material reach-forward losses. Auditing the estimated revenues for the 787 program involved extensive audit effort and required professionals with specialized industry experience given the high degree of complexity and subjectivity related to management's estimates.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures over the estimated revenues for the 787 program included the following, among others:\n\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including individuals responsible for engineering and production operations, to assess  whether the estimated FAA  approval and  delivery resumption date represent management's best estimates based on the status of the rework activity.\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including the individuals communicating with the FAA, to assess if there is contradictory information to that assumed by management related to the estimated timeline for rework completion or getting FAA approval to resume deliveries.\n- We evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  method  for  developing  the  deliveries schedule assumptions.\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate the status of current contracts with customers and expected consideration to be provided to customers.\n- We evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  and  significant  assumptions used in developing its estimates related to forecasted revenue for aircraft which have or are expected to have delivery delays.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the key data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical  extrapolation  of  such  data,  and  management's  judgment  regarding  the  range  of  reasonable outcomes relating to the specific estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "outfitted aircraft. Revenue associated with the segment's custom completions of narrow-body and wide-body aircraft and the segment's services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Fluctuations  in  revenue  from  period  to  period  result  from  the  number  and  mix  of  new  aircraft  deliveries, progress on aircraft completions, and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period.\n\nThe majority of the Aerospace segment's operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots, recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace segment's completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred.\n\nFor new aircraft, operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of ultra-large-cabin, large-cabin and midcabin aircraft deliveries. Aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft models. A new aircraft model typically has lower margins in its initial production lots, and then margins generally increase as  we  realize  efficiencies  in  the  production  process. Additional  factors  affecting  the  segment's  earnings  and margin include the volume, mix and profitability of completions and services work performed, the market for pre-owned  aircraft,  and  the  level  of  general  and  administrative  (G&amp;A)  and  net  research  and  development (R&amp;D) costs incurred by the segment.\n\nIn the defense segments, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized generally over time as the  work  progresses,  either  as  products  are  produced  or  as  services  are  rendered.  Typically,  revenue  is recognized  over  time  using  costs  incurred  to  date  relative  to  total  estimated  costs  at  completion  to  measure progress  toward  satisfying  our  performance  obligations.  Incurred  cost  represents  work  performed,  which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&amp;A expenses. Variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts. Because costs are used as a measure of progress, year-over-year variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volume.\n\nOperating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the  estimated  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  both.  Therefore,  changes  in  costs  incurred  in  the  period compared with  prior  periods  do  not  necessarily  impact  profitability.  It  is  only  when  total  estimated  costs  at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value (or vice versa) that the  profitability  of  that  contract  may  be  impacted.  Contract  mix  refers  to  changes  in  the  volume  of  higherversus lower-margin work. Higher or lower margins can result from a number of factors, including contract type (e.g.,  fixed-price/cost-reimbursable)  and  type  of  work  (e.g.,  development/production).  Contract  mix  can  also refer  to  the  stage  of  program  maturity  for  our  long-term  production  contracts.  New  long-term  production contracts  typically  have  lower  margins  initially,  and  then  margins  generally  increase  as  we  achieve  learning curve improvements or realize other cost reductions.",

Caterpillar highlights a shift from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans, freezing all U.S. defined benefit pensions as of 2019 and increasing employer contributions to 401(k) plans. Emerson reports pension assets as part of its noncurrent assets, with a value of $881 million in 2022, indicating continued involvement in defined benefit structures but without disclosing specific investment strategies.

Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.\n\nWe periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. A key element of our strategy is to de-risk the plan as the funded status of the plan increases. During 2021, as the funded status of the plans increased, certain assets were reallocated to fixed income. The  changes  in  the  asset  allocation  are  reflected  in  the  asset  allocation  table  below.  We  identify  investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy  changes,  market  value  fluctuations,  the  length  of  time  it  takes  to  fully  implement  investment  allocation positions,  and  the  timing  of  benefit  payments  and  contributions.  Short-term  investments  and  exchange-traded derivatives  are  used  to  rebalance  the  actual  asset  allocation  to  the  target  asset  allocation.  The  asset  allocation  is monitored  and  rebalanced  frequently.  The  actual  and  target  allocations  by  asset  class  for  the  pension  assets  at December 31 were as follows:\n\n",

Defined contribution plans\n\nWe have both U.S. and non-U.S. employee defined contribution plans to help employees save for retirement. Our primary U.S. 401(k) plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. Employees  with  frozen  defined  benefit  pension  accruals  are  eligible  for  matching  contributions  equal  to  100  percent  of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age). Employees that were still accruing benefits under a  defined  benefit  pension  plan  up  to  December  31,  2019  were  eligible  for  matching  contributions  equal  to  50  percent  of employee  contributions  up  to  6  percent  of  cash  compensation. All  our  U.S.  defined  benefit  pension  plans  were  frozen  on December  31,  2019  for  remaining  employees  still  accruing  a  benefit.  Starting  in  2020,  these  employees  receive  matching contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age).\n\nThese 401(k) plans include various investment funds, including a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the ESOP held 12.4 million and 13.2 million shares, respectively. We allocate all of the shares held  by  the  ESOP  to  participant  accounts.  Dividends  paid  to  participants  are  automatically  reinvested  into  company  shares unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant. Various other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans generally allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plans, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution to the funds.",

      "answer": "Boeing reported a significantly low effective income tax rate of (11.8)% in 2023, largely due to net operating losses and tax credits, indicating a distressed financial position. RTX achieved a lower effective tax rate of 11.9% in 2023, driven by U.S. R&D credits, FDII benefits, and international tax planning, suggesting a proactive tax optimization strategy. UPS maintained a much higher effective tax rate of 21.8% in 2023, with relatively minor adjustments from state and international tax items, reflecting a more stable and less tax-incentivized operational profile. This comparison reveals that Boeing\u2019s tax rate is shaped by financial losses, RTX\u2019s by strategic tax incentives, and UPS\u2019s by consistent operational profitability.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar notes that distributions of profits from non-U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to non-U.S. withholding taxes if profits are distributed from certain jurisdictions, with approximately $15 billion of undistributed profits considered indefinitely reinvested. Honeywell reports a decrease in expense related to unremitted withholding taxes on non-U.S. earnings in 2023, contributing to a lower effective tax rate. UPS states that $493 million of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries is considered indefinitely reinvested, and upon distribution, the company would be subject to U.S. state and local taxes and withholding taxes in various jurisdictions. Together, these perspectives show differing levels of exposure and strategic approaches to managing withholding tax implications of international earnings.",

GD relies heavily on leasing for machinery and equipment, with real estate and equipment leases forming a significant portion of its lease obligations, suggesting a preference for operational flexibility over ownership. MMM reports a substantial net investment in machinery and equipment, valued at $17,305 million in 2022, reflecting a capital-intensive, asset-heavy strategy.

Under ASC 820, measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Within the hierarchy, Level 1 instruments use observable market prices for an identical item in active markets and have the most reliable valuations. Level 2 instruments are valued through broker/dealer quotation or other approaches using market-observable inputs for similar items in active markets, including forward and spot prices, interest rates and volatilities. Level 3 instruments are valued using inputs not observable in an active market, such as company-developed future cash flow estimates, and are considered the least reliable. Valuations for all of the Company's financial instruments fall within Level 2. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is Level 2, estimated using current interest rates and pricing from financial institutions and other market sources for debt with similar maturities and characteristics.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nThe Company records investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment at cost. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over estimated service lives, which for principal assets are 30 to 40 years for buildings and 8 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Long-lived tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized based on estimated fair values if the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less than the carrying values.\n\nThe components of property, plant and equipment as of September 30 follow:\n\n",

When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we include the impact of the option in the lease term for purposes of determining total future lease payments. As most of our lease agreements do not explicitly state the discount rate implicit in the lease, we use our incremental borrowing rate on the commencement date to calculate the present value of future payments.\n\nOur leases commonly include payments that are based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other similar indices. These variable lease payments are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Other variable lease payments, such as usage-based amounts, are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability, and are expensed as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments, the calculation of the ROU asset also includes any deferred rent, lease pre-payments and initial direct costs of obtaining the lease, such as commissions.\n\nIn addition to the base rent, real estate leases typically contain provisions for common-area maintenance and other similar services, which are considered non-lease components for accounting purposes. For our real estate leases, we apply a practical expedient to include these non-lease components in calculating the ROU asset and lease liability. For all other types of leases, non-lease components are excluded from our ROU assets and lease liabilities and expensed as incurred.\n\nOur  leases  are  for  office  space,  manufacturing  facilities,  and  machinery  and  equipment.  Real  estate represents over 75% of our lease obligations.\n\nThe components of lease costs were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Boeing reported $11,736 million in commercial revenue and $7,832 million in government revenue for 2024, indicating a clear commercial focus. FedEx organizes its business into service-line segments including FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services, with estimates of future costs and revenue assumptions tied to these segments. Raytheon actively restructured its segments in 2024 by selling its Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services business for $1.3 billion and the Goodrich Hoist & Winch business for $0.5 billion, while also adopting new segment reporting standards retroactively. These approaches show Boeing emphasizing revenue composition transparency, FedEx focusing on service-line performance, and Raytheon transforming its segment portfolio through divestitures.",

During the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of progress towards regulatory approvals, held for sale criteria was met. As such, at December 31, 2024, the related assets of approximately $1.5 billion and liabilities of approx imately $0.6 billion have been accounted for as held for sale at fair value less cost to sell. Held for sale assets primarily include $0.7 billion of goodwill and intangible assets presented in Other assets and $0.3 billion of inventory presented in Other assets, current. Held for sale liabilities primarily include $0.4 billion of contract liabilities and other accrued liabilities presented in Other accrued liabilities. The closing  of  the  transaction  is  subject  to  regulatory  approvals  and  other  customary  closing  conditions.

However, there are a number of factors that could affect the estimate in the future, including: future judicial decisions or binding resolutions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or the Polish Supreme Court that could increase the cost to banks of loans invalidated by Polish courts and encourage more borrower lawsuits; the impact of any such decisions or resolutions on how Polish courts will interpret and apply the law in particular cases; the receptivity of borrowers over time to Bank BPH's settlement program; the number of active and inactive borrowers who sue Bank BPH; the ability of Bank BPH to recover from borrowers the original principal amount of loans invalidated by Polish courts; and the impact of potential future legislation in Poland to expedite the court process for borrowers or otherwise relating to foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans. While we are unable at this time to develop a meaningful estimate of reasonably possible losses beyond the amount currently recorded, future changes related to any of the foregoing or in Bank BPH's settlement approach, or other adverse developments such as actions by regulators, legislators or other governmental authorities (including consumer protection regulators), could increase our estimate of total losses and potentially require future cash contributions to Bank BPH. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS . Our operations involve or have involved the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws, including activities for a variety of matters related to GE businesses that have been discontinued or exited. We record reserves for obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup, and for additional liabilities we expect to incur in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged exposure by workers and others to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to indiv idual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Total reserves related to environmental remediation and worker exposure claims were $2,003 million and $1,819 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nExpenditures for site remediation and worker exposure claims amounted to approximately $175 million, $246 million and $195 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately $225 million and $225 million in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 25. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION &amp; REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION\n\nSEGMENT INFORMATION. On April 2, 2024, and in conjunction with the GE V ernova separation, we implemented an organizational change to align our reportable segments more closely with our business structure. In connection with our segment reporting change, we have recast previously reported amounts across all reportable segments to conform to current segment presentation.\n\nWe have two reportable segments and three operating segments. Operating segments are aggregated into a reportable segment if the operating segments have similar quantitative economic characteristics and if the operating segments are similar in the following qualitative characteristics: (i) nature of products and services; (ii) nature of production processes; (iii) ty pe or class of customer for their products and services; (iv) methods used to distribute the products or provide services; and (v) if applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment. We have aggregated Defense &amp; Systems and Propulsion &amp; A dditive Technology into one reportable segment (Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies) based on similarity in economic characteristics, other qualitative factors and the objectives and principals of A SC 280, Segment Reporting. This is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker (CODM ), who is our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), allocates resources and makes decisions. Segment accounting policies are the same as described and referenced in Note 1. See About GE Aerospace for a description of our reporting segments as of December 31, 2024.\n\nSegment revenue includes sales of equipment and services by our segments. Segment profit is determined based on performance measures used by our CODM. Our CODM uses segment profit or loss to assess performance and allocate resources to each segment, primarily through periodic budgeting and segment performance reviews. In connection with that assessment, our CODM  may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, costs associated with separation activities, manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions and certain litigation settlements. Segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries. Certain corporate costs, including those related to shared services, employee benefits and information technology, are allocated to our segments based on usage or their relative net cost of operations. See the Corporate &amp; Other section within M D&amp;A  for further information about costs excluded from segment profit.\n\nThe Company does not report total assets by segment for internal or external reporting purposes as the Company's CODM  does not assess performance, make strategic decisions, or allocate resources based on assets.\n\n74 2024 FORM  10-K",

Additionally, the amendments require the disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources. We adopted this standard for the annual period ending December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis. We updated our segment disclosures to comply with the requirements. See 'Note 20: Segment Financial Data.' The adoption of the standard did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\n\nOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2024 are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\n\n## NOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\n\nAcquisitions. Our investments in businesses, net of cash acquired, in 2022 totaled $66 million and consisted of insignificant acquisitions.\n\nDispositions. In 2024, 2023, and 2022 cash inflows related to dispositions of businesses were $1,795 million, $6 million, and $94 million, respectively. Our dispositions of businesses in 2024 primarily consisted of the dispositions discussed below. Our dispositions of businesses in 2023 and 2022 were insignificant.\n\nOn March 29, 2024, we completed the sale of our Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within our Raytheon segment for proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion in cash, resulting in an aggregate pre-tax  gain, net of transaction and other related costs, of $0.4 billion ($0.2 billion after tax ), primarily recognized in Other income (expense), net within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nOn October 31, 2024, we completed the sale of our G oodrich Hoist &amp; Winch business within our Collins segment for proceeds of approximately $0.5 billion in cash, resulting in a pre-tax  gain, net of transaction and other related costs, of $0.1 billion, primarily recognized in Other income (expense), net within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nOn July 20, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the actuation and flight control business within our Collins segment to Safran S.A. for gross proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of progress towards regulatory approvals, held for sale criteria was met. As such, at December 31, 2024, the related assets of approximately $1.5 billion and liabilities of approx imately $0.6 billion have been accounted for as held for sale at fair value less cost to sell. Held for sale assets primarily include $0.7 billion of goodwill and intangible assets presented in Other assets and $0.3 billion of inventory presented in Other assets, current. Held for sale liabilities primarily include $0.4 billion of contract liabilities and other accrued liabilities presented in Other accrued liabilities. The closing  of  the  transaction  is  subject  to  regulatory  approvals  and  other  customary  closing  conditions.  This  disposition  does  not  qualify  for  presentation  as discontinued operations.\n\n## NOTE 3: GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nGoodwill. Changes in our goodwill balances for the year ended December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "General Dynamics reports noncurrent liabilities of $1,797 million against noncurrent assets of $130 million, indicating a heavily liability-driven balance sheet structure. Honeywell shows minimal noncurrent liabilities of $6 million relative to other noncurrent assets of $20 million, suggesting a more asset-backed capital structure. Union Pacific has noncurrent liabilities of $363 million compared to noncurrent assets of $950 million, reflecting a balanced approach with greater asset coverage. These differences highlight varied capital strategies: GD appears to rely more on long-term debt, HON maintains a conservative liability profile, and UNP leverages its strong asset base to support moderate long-term obligations.",

Air conditioning, heating and refrigeration sales were strong, reflecting global demand across all end markets. Tools &amp; Home Products sales were $2.0 billion in 2022, up $128 or 7 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of professional tools and food waste disposers were strong, while wet/dry vacuums decreased moderately due to difficult comparisons. Overall, underlying sales increased 15 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 14 percent) and 11 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa increased 5 percent (China down 7 percent). Earnings were $1,440, an increase of $76, and margin was down 0.6 percentage points, as price less net material inflation was favorable but had a slightly dilutive impact on margins and higher freight and other inflation also negatively impacted margins, partially offset by leverage on higher sales and savings from cost reduction actions.\n\n2021 vs. 2020 - Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions sales were $6.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1,010, or 18 percent. Underlying sales increased 16 percent on strong global demand, as nearly all businesses achieved doubledigit growth each quarter, while foreign currency translation added 2 percent. Climate Technologies sales were $4.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $768, or 19 percent. Air conditioning and heating sales were up mid-teens, reflecting strong demand for residential-oriented products and solutions in North America and robust growth in Europe and China. Cold chain sales were up over 20 percent, driven by favorable global market conditions and strength in food retail and aftermarket. Tools &amp; Home Products sales were $1.9 billion in 2021, up $242 or 15 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of wet/dry vacuums were robust in part due to competitor outages, while sales were strong for global professional tools and solid for food waste disposers. Overall, underlying sales increased 16 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 15 percent) and 17 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa increased 17 percent (China up 17 percent). Earnings were $1,364, an increase of $246, and margin was up 0.7 percentage points, reflecting leverage on higher volume and savings from cost reduction actions, partially offset by unfavorable price-cost primarily due to steel price increases which negatively impacted the second half of the fiscal year.\n\n## Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nEmerson maintains a conservative financial structure to provide the strength and flexibility necessary to achieve our strategic objectives and has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth.\n\nEmerson is in a strong financial position, with total assets of $36 billion and stockholders' equity of $10 billion, and has the resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis.\n\nThe Company continues to generate substantial operating cash flow with over $2.9 billion in each of the last three years. Cash flows have been and are expected to be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet the Company's operating requirements, including those related to salaries and wages, working capital, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with operations. The Company also has certain contractual obligations, primarily longterm debt and operating leases (see Notes 7, 10 and 11). The Company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet its needs for the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, short- and long-term debt capacity, or its $3.5 billion revolving backup credit facility under which it has not incurred any borrowings.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our three commodity groups. Freight revenues  vary  with  volume  (carloads)  and  ARC.  Changes  in  price,  traffic  mix,  and  fuel  surcharges  drive  ARC. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes,  are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. Customer  incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available  historical,  current,  and  forecasted  volumes,  and  recognized  as  the  related  performance  obligation  is satisfied. We recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue  between  reporting  periods  is  based  on  the  relative  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses recognized as incurred.\n\nOther subsidiary revenues (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses  recognized  as  incurred.  Accessorial  revenues  are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nOur freight revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $20.2 billion driven by a 4% increase in volume, higher fuel surcharge  revenue,  core  pricing  gains,  and  positive  mix  of  traffic  (for  example,  a  relative  increase  in  industrial shipments, which have a higher ARC). Volume increased in every key market segment compared to 2020 due to the recovery  from  the  depressed  economy  brought  on  by  the  COVID  pandemic  in  2020.  While  the  markets  have rebounded from 2020, our 2021 volume levels are 4% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOur  fuel  surcharge  programs  generated  freight  revenues  of  $1.7  billion  and  $1.0  billion  in  2021  and  2020, respectively. Fuel surcharge revenue in 2021 increased $0.7 billion as a result of a 49% increase in fuel price and a 4% increase in  carloadings,  partially  offset  by  the  lag  impact  on  fuel  surcharge  (it  can  generally  take  up  to  two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharges recoveries).\n\nIn 2021, other subsidiary revenues were flat with 2020 as the semiconductor shortage negatively impacting 2021 automotive  production  offset  the  recovery  from  other  COVID  related  declines  in  2020.  Accessorial  revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by increased intermodal accessorial charges tied to global supply chain disruptions. Other revenue was essentially flat year-over-year.",

LMT discloses a pension settlement charge of $1.31 billion in 2021, net of tax, indicating a significant one-time impact from pension-related actions. UNP explains that it applies a 5-year smoothing mechanism to asset returns to reduce volatility in pension expense, which delays recognition of actual vs. expected return differences.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a 5-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized in net income immediately, but are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and, if necessary, amortized as pension expense.\n\nThe components of our net periodic pension cost were as follows for the years ended  December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n\n",

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the implementation of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, among them changing the process for certification of commercial aircraft. Comparable agencies that regulate similar matters in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or other similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. The 737 program experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of commercial operations of the 737 MAX aircraft by civil aviation  authorities around the globe. 737 MAX deliveries resumed in late 2020 and early 2021 upon approval of the FAA and other nonU.S. civil aviation authorities. During 2020 and 2021, we experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries, including a pause in 787 deliveries since May 2021. During 2021, this  resulted  in  reprioritizing  production  resources  to  support  inspections  and  rework.  We  continue  to  conduct inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries as well as rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the  contractual  delivery  date.  The  regulators  will  ultimately  determine  the  timing  and  conditions  for  resuming  787 deliveries. Delays on the 737 MAX, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\n\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to  adjust  production  rates  on  several  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs.  During  2021,  we  reprioritized  production resources to support inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft. The 787 program is currently producing at very low rates and expects that to continue until deliveries resume. We are also continuing to implement changes in the production  process  designed  to  ensure  that  newly-built  airplanes  meet  our  specifications  and  do  not  require  further inspections  and  rework.  In  addition,  we  continue  to  seek  opportunities  to  reduce  the  costs  of  building  our  aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory.

          "chunk_text": "## For the year ended December 31, 2021, segment revenues were down $0.7 billion (3%) and segment profit was up $1.7 billion.\n\nRPO as of December 31, 2021 increased $11.2 billion (10%) from December 31, 2020, due to increases in both equipment and services. Equipment increased primarily due to an increase in Military orders. Services increased primarily as a result of engines contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service.\n\nRevenues decreased $0.7 billion (3%) organically*. Commercial Engines revenues decreased, due to 233 fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including fewer engine shipments on legacy programs, partially offset by 30 more LEAP units versus the prior year. Commercial Services revenues increased, primarily due to increased shop visit volume, partially offset by lower volume on commercial spare part shipments, as prior year revenues included significant spare part shipments prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Commercial Services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, included a net unfavorable change in estimated profitability of $0.3 billion for its long-term service agreements compared to a net unfavorable change of $1.1 billion for the prior year. Military revenues decreased due to lower services and 130 fewer engine shipments, partially offset by product mix.\n\nProfit increased $1.6 billion organically*, primarily due to increased shop visit volume and the receipt of a payment from a partner associated with engine program activity. Profit also increased due to lower net unfavorable changes in estimated profitability in longterm service agreements, as the prior year included charges reflecting the cumulative COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts of changes to billing and cost assumptions for certain long-term service agreements; operational cost reduction from the actions taken in 2020 and the first half of 2021; and the nonrecurrence of prior year charges related to lower commercial engine production volumes, customer credit risk and an impairment charge in a joint venture in the Systems business. These increases in profit were partially offset by an accrual for a contract in a loss position in the long-term service agreement portfolio.\n\nHEALTHCARE. Healthcare provides essential healthcare technologies to developed and emerging markets and has expertise in medical imaging, digital solutions, patient monitoring and diagnostics, drug discovery and performance improvement solutions that are the building blocks of precision health. Products and services are sold worldwide primarily to hospitals and medical facilities.\n\nHealthcare Systems (HCS) - develops, manufactures, markets and services a broad suite of products and solutions used in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients that is encompassed in imaging, ultrasound, life care solutions and enterprise software and solutions. Imaging includes magnetic resonance, computed tomography, molecular imaging, x-ray systems and complementary software and services, for use in general diagnostics, women's health and image-guided therapies. Ultrasound includes highfrequency soundwave systems, and complementary software and services, for use in diagnostics tailored to a wide range of clinical settings. Life Care Solutions (LCS) includes clinical monitoring and acute care systems, and complementary software and services, for use in intensive care, anesthesia delivery, diagnostic cardiology and perinatal care. Enterprise Digital Solutions (EDS) includes enterprise digital, artificial intelligence applications, consulting and Command Center offerings designed to improve efficiency in healthcare delivery and expand global access to advanced health care.\n\nPharmaceutical Diagnostics (PDx) - researches, manufactures and markets innovative imaging agents used during medical scanning procedures to highlight organs, tissue and functions inside the human body, to aid physicians in the early detection, diagnosis and management of disease through advanced in-vivo diagnostics. These products include both contrast imaging and molecular imaging agents.\n\nBioPharma - This business was sold on March 31, 2020. It delivered products, services and manufacturing solutions for drug discovery, biopharmaceutical production, and cellular and gene therapy technologies.\n\nCompetition &amp; Regulation. Healthcare competes with a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers and services providers. Customers require products and services that allow them to provide better access to healthcare, improve the affordability of care and improve the quality of patient outcomes. Key factors affecting competition include technological innovations, productivity solutions, competitive pricing and the ability to provide lifecycle services. New technologies and solutions could make our products and services obsolete unless we continue to develop new and improved offerings. Our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, as well as laws and regulations that apply to various reimbursement systems or other government funded healthcare programs.\n\nSignificant Trends &amp; Developments. We continue to see an overall recovery in hospital spending; the expectation is that this will continue in line with the worldwide COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Both HCS and PDx demand has recovered to at or above pre-pandemic levels. Similar to many industries, we are experiencing inflation in our supply chain as well as delays in sourcing key materials needed for our products, such as electronics and resins, delaying our ability to convert RPO to revenue. We have proactively managed sourcing and logistics, material and design costs to partially mitigate supply chain impacts. In response to near-term volatility and cost pressures, we have continued to execute on structural cost reductions and cash optimization actions, in order to invest in growth and research and development.\n\nWe continue to grow and invest in precision health, with focus on creating new products and digital solutions as well as expanding uses of existing offerings that are tailored to the different needs of our global customers. We introduced the Vscan Air in over 70 countries, a cutting edge wireless pocket-sized ultrasound that is differentiated by its crystal clear image quality, whole-body scanning capabilities, and intuitive software. We continue to see the broader application of our AIR Recon DL technology, which provides best in class image quality as well as substantially reduced scan time. An example of a new product that includes AIR Recon DL is the SIGNA Hero magnetic resonance imaging system that helps accommodate more patients of all shapes and sizes, offering a 70 cm bore and detachable table for enhanced patient comfort. We introduced the Revolution APEX CT, which has a modular and scalable design to do in-room upgrades on the detector without swapping the gantry, giving customers the flexibility to right size their purchase today and be ready for the future. We remain committed to innovate and invest to create more integrated, efficient, and personalized precision healthcare.",

      "question": "How do FDX, GD, and UNP compare in their weighted-average remaining contractual terms for stock options, and what might these differences suggest about their respective equity compensation strategies?",
      "answer": "FDX reports a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 6.3 years for all outstanding options, with exercisable options having a term of 5.0 years and expected-to-vest options at 8.1 years. GD shows a more uniform term of 6.6 years across all outstanding options and 6.6 years for vested and expected-to-vest options, with exercisable options at 5.1 years. UNP has a term of 6.3 years for all outstanding options and 6.3 years for vested or expected-to-vest options, with exercisable options at 5.2 years. These figures suggest that while all three companies have similar structures for exercisable options, FDX\u2019s expected-to-vest options have a notably longer term, potentially signaling a more forward-looking incentive structure compared to GD and UNP.",

Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.\n\nWe periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. A key element of our strategy is to de-risk the plan as the funded status of the plan increases. During 2021, as the funded status of the plans increased, certain assets were reallocated to fixed income. The  changes  in  the  asset  allocation  are  reflected  in  the  asset  allocation  table  below.  We  identify  investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy  changes,  market  value  fluctuations,  the  length  of  time  it  takes  to  fully  implement  investment  allocation positions,  and  the  timing  of  benefit  payments  and  contributions.  Short-term  investments  and  exchange-traded derivatives  are  used  to  rebalance  the  actual  asset  allocation  to  the  target  asset  allocation.  The  asset  allocation  is monitored  and  rebalanced  frequently.  The  actual  and  target  allocations  by  asset  class  for  the  pension  assets  at December 31 were as follows:\n\n",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nAsset groups represent the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified. Determining the asset group requires judgment and changes in the way asset groups are defined could have material impact to the results of impairment testing. We perform recoverability testing by comparing the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as appropriate. Details of long-lived asset impairments are included in note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nIn the normal course of business, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk, including derivatives, marketable securities, finance receivables, pension assets, other investments and debt. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, principally derivatives, marketable securities, pension assets and certain other investments. These financial instruments are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis based upon a fair value hierarchy (Levels 1, 2 and 3). Fair values are based on listed market prices (Level 1), when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations (Level 2). If listed market prices or other relevant factors are not available, inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability (Level 3). Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, foreign currency exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Further information on our accounting polices relating to fair value measurements can be found in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the majority of our financial instruments were categorized as either Level 1 or Level 2. Refer to notes 3, 10 and 18 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on these instruments. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk section of this report.\n\nWithin our pension assets, we hold investments in hedge, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate funds which are primarily measured using net asset value (\"NAV\") as a practical expedient for fair value, as appropriate. These investments were valued at $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. In order to estimate NAV, we evaluate audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers and make adjustments for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these assumptions. If our estimates of activity changed, this could have a material impact on the reported value of these investments and on the return on assets that we report. Refer to note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension assets.\n\nCertain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property, plant, and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. These assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of an impairment or when an asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale.\n\nIn accounting for business acquisitions, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment, especially with respect to identified intangible assets as there may be limited or no observable transactions within the market, requiring us to develop internal models to estimate fair value. For example, estimating the fair value of identified intangible assets may require us to develop valuation assumptions, including but not limited to, future expected cash flows from identified intangible assets, synergies and the cost of capital. Certain inputs require us to determine assumptions that are reflective of a market participant view of fair value. Changes in any of these assumptions may materially impact the amount we recognize for identifiable assets and liabilities, in addition to the residual amount allocated to goodwill.",

      "question": "How do Lockheed Martin (LMT), 3M (MMM), and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) each characterize their exposure to environmental liabilities, and what does this reveal about their differing levels of risk and financial preparedness in addressing such obligations?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) acknowledges environmental liabilities as part of its significant accounting estimates, indicating that these liabilities are probable of future recovery and are factored into its financial reporting. 3M (MMM) discloses a substantial increase in its environmental liabilities in 2023, recording $11.0 billion for 'other environmental liabilities' and $36 million for non-PFAS related remediation, showing a high level of exposure and financial commitment to addressing environmental concerns. Raytheon Technologies (RTX), in contrast, does not disclose specific figures or accruals for environmental liabilities but states that it does not expect any current legal or environmental matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, suggesting a lower perceived risk or more contained liabilities. This comparison reveals that MMM faces the most immediate and quantifiably large environmental liability exposure, while RTX appears to have the least disclosed financial burden, and LMT indicates a measured approach with probable recovery mechanisms in place.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Environmental Liabilities: LMT includes environmental liabilities as part of its significant accounting estimates, indicating that these liabilities are probable of future recovery and are factored into its financial reporting.",

        "Hop 3: RTX \u2192 Environmental Liabilities: RTX does not provide specific figures for environmental liabilities but states that it does not expect any current environmental matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, suggesting lower exposure or confidence in containment of liabilities."

      "question": "How do Emerson (EMR), FedEx (FDX), and Honeywell (HON) each characterize the role of 'volume' in driving sales performance, and what does this reveal about the differing dynamics impacting their respective 2024 results?",
      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) reported that 4% higher volume contributed to a 6% increase in underlying sales in 2024, indicating a strong volume-driven growth trend. FedEx (FDX), in contrast, experienced volume declines that contributed to a 3% overall revenue decrease in 2024, particularly affecting FedEx Express and FedEx Freight. Honeywell (HON) saw only a 1% contribution from volume to its 5% total net sales growth in 2024, suggesting volume played a minor role compared to pricing and other factors. This comparison reveals that while EMR benefited from robust volume growth, FDX faced headwinds from volume contraction, and HON experienced modest volume support amid more emphasis on price and strategic acquisitions or divestitures.",

Intelligent Dev ices sales increased 5 percent, while Software and Control sales increased 48 percent, which included the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition. Underlying sales were up 6 percent on 4 percent higher v olume and 2 percent higher price. The Test &amp; Measurement acquisition added 9.5 percent and the div estiture of Metran deducted 0.5 percent. Underlying sales were up 2 percent in the U.S. and up 9 percent internationally.\n\nNet sales for 2023 were $15.2 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 10 percent compared with 2022. Intelligent Dev ices sales increased 7 percent, while Software and Control sales increased 20 percent, which included the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. Underlying sales increased 10 percent on 6 percent higher v olume and 4 percent higher price. Foreign currency translation subtracted 2 percent, the Heritage AspenTech acquisition added 3 percent and the div estiture of Metran deducted 1 percent. Underlying sales were up 11 percent in the U.S. and up 9 percent internationally. INTERNATIONAL SALES\n\nEmerson is a global business with international sales representing 60 percent of total sales in 2024, including U.S. exports. The Company generally expects faster economic growth in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Middle East/Africa. International destination sales, including U.S. exports, increased 18 percent, to $10.5 billion in 2024, reflecting the Company's ov erall increase in sales and the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition. U.S. exports of $1.3 billion were up 26 percent compared with 2023. Underlying international destination sales were up 9 percent and the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition added 9 percent. Underlying sales increased 7 percent in Europe, 8 percent in Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa (China down 3 percent), 21 percent in Latin America and 5 percent in Canada. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $9.3 billion in 2024, up 20 percent compared with 2023.\n\nInternational destination sales, including U.S. exports, increased 9 percent, to $8.9 billion in 2023, reflecting the Company's ov erall increase in sales and the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition. U.S. exports of $1.0 billion were up 6 percent compared with 2022. Underlying international destination sales were up 9 percent, as foreign currency translation had a 3 percent unfav orable impact on the comparison, the Heritage AspenTech acquisition added 3 percent and the div estiture of Metran deducted 1 percent. Underlying sales increased 10 percent in Europe, 9 percent in Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa (China up 4 percent), 14 percent in Latin America and 1 percent in Canada.

Revenue at Corporate, other, and eliminations decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower yields and reduced volume at FedEx Logistics, Inc. ('FedEx Logistics'). FedEx Freight revenue decreased 6% in 2024 primarily due to lower shipments, weight per shipment, and fuel surcharges, partially offset by base yield improvement. FedEx Ground revenue increased 2% in 2024 primarily due to base yield improvement and higher volume, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\n\nIn 2024, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft and seven related engines to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $157 million ($120 million, net of tax , or $0.48 per diluted share) was recorded in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines for the same reasons stated above. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax , or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to FedEx Dataworks. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. We also recorded an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax , or $0.03 per diluted share) noncash intangible asset impairment charge related to the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx  Dataworks. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of this MD&amp;A and Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Business Optimization and Realignment Costs\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We have commenced our plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to bring FedEx Ground and FedEx Services into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground express network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight continues to provide LTL freight transportation services as a separate subsidiary. The organizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. These costs were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. The identification of these costs as business optimization-related ex penditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures. We expect the aggregate pre-tax cost of our business optimization activities to be approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. The timing and amount of our business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.",

Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but  are  not  limited  to,  the  resale  market,  which  could  potentially  include  the  cost  of  long-term  storage;  the  leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer's requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly  basis,  we  update  our  valuation  analysis  based  on  the  actual  activities  associated  with  placing  each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions.\n\nUsed aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in Customer financing.\n\nCustomer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset.\n\nWe  assess  the  fair  value  of  equipment  under  operating  leases,  assets  held  for  sale  or  re-lease,  and  collateral underlying receivables to determine if their  fair  values  are  less  than  the  related  customer  financing  assets'  carrying values.  Differences  between  carrying  values  and  fair  values  of  sales-type/finance  leases  and  notes  and  other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables.\n\nWe use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on  the  type  and  age  of  the  aircraft  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  aircraft.  Under  certain  circumstances,  we  apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications.\n\nImpairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining",

          "chunk_text": "Operational execution - Operational challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company's financial results depend on the successful execution of our businesses' operating plans across all steps of the product and service lifecycle. We continue working to improve the operations and execution of our businesses and our ability to make the desired improvements will be a significant factor in our overall financial performance. We also face operational risks in connection with launching or ramping new product platforms, such as the Haliade-X offshore wind turbine or the Cypress onshore wind turbine at Renewable Energy, or the LEAP engine at Aviation. With significant new product platforms and technologies, our businesses seek to reduce the costs of these products over time with experience, and risks related to our supply chain, product quality, timely delivery or other aspects of operational execution can adversely affect our profit margins or free cash flow. Operational failures at any of our businesses that result in quality problems or potential product, environmental, health or safety risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. In addition, a portion of our business, particularly within our Power and Renewable Energy businesses, involves large projects where we take on, or are members of a consortium responsible for, the full scope of engineering, procurement, construction or other services. These types of projects often pose unique risks related to their location, scale, complexity, duration and pricing or payment structure. Performance issues or schedule delays can arise due to inadequate technical expertise, unanticipated project modifications, developments at project sites, environmental, health and safety issues, execution by or coordination with suppliers, subcontractors or consortium partners, financial difficulties of our customers or significant partners or compliance with government regulations, and these can lead to cost overruns, contractual penalties, liquidated damages and other adverse consequences. Where GE is a member of a consortium, we are typically subject to claims based on joint and several liability, and claims can extend to aspects of the project or costs that are not directly related or limited to GE's scope of work or over which GE does not have control. Operational, quality or other issues at large projects, or across our projects portfolio more broadly, can adversely affect GE's business, reputation or results of operations.\n\nProduct safety - Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, and a major failure or similar event affecting our products or third-party products with which our products are integrated can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services for both our own and third-party products that incorporate or use complex or leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Many of our products and services involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure projects, such as commercial jet engines, gas turbines, onshore and offshore wind turbines or nuclear power generation, and accordingly the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant. In particular, actual or perceived design or production issues related to new product introductions or relatively new product lines can result in significant reputational harm to our businesses, in addition to direct warranty, maintenance and other costs that may arise. A significant product issue resulting in injuries or death, widespread outages, a fleet grounding or similar systemic consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. In some circumstances, we have and in the future we may continue to incur increased costs, delayed payments or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party's product with which our products are integrated, or if parts or other components that we incorporate in our products have defects or other quality issues. There can be no assurance that the operational processes around product design, manufacture, performance and servicing that we or our customers or other third parties have designed to meet rigorous quality standards will be sufficient to prevent us or our customers or other third parties from experiencing operational process or product failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cyber-attacks or other intentional acts, software vulnerabilities or malicious software, that could result in potential product, safety, quality, regulatory or environmental risks.\n\nCybersecurity - Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks such as ransomware, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to the security of GE's and its customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' infrastructure, products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of GE's and its customers' data. As the perpetrators of such attacks become more capable (including sophisticated state or state-affiliated actors), and as critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. A significant cyber-related attack in one of our industries, even if such an attack does not involve GE products, services or systems, could pose broader disruptions and adversely affect our business. We have also observed an increase in thirdparty breaches and ransomware attacks at suppliers, service providers and software providers, and our efforts to mitigate adverse effects on GE if this trend continues may be less successful in the future. The increasing degree of interconnectedness between GE and its partners, suppliers and customers also poses a risk to the security of GE's network as well as the larger ecosystem in which GE operates. There can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, performing security reviews and requiring business partners with connections to the GE network to appropriately secure their information technology systems, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, will be sufficient to prevent, detect and limit the impact of cyber-related attacks, and we remain vulnerable to known or unknown threats. In addition to existing risks, the adoption of new technologies in the future may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breaches and failures. While we have developed secure development lifecycle design practices to secure our software designs and connected products, an unknown vulnerability or compromise could potentially impact the security of GE's software or connected products and lead to the loss of GE intellectual property, misappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal data, safety risks or unavailability of equipment. We also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we have vulnerability to security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to material compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems,",

The discount rate used to calculate present value is 3M's incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\n\nAs a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3M's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nCertain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend the lease term up to five years. 3M includes options to renew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, 3M is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.\n\nFor the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3M groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used beyond their noncancellable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, additional payments related to a subsequent adjustment in an inflation index, and payments for non-components such as sales tax. Certain 3M leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle for Determining Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Plan Cost\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, 3M changed the method it uses to calculate the market-related value of fixed income securities included in its pension and other postretirement plan assets. The market-related value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of net unamortized actuarial gains or losses expense components of net periodic benefit cost. The Company previously used the calculated value approach for all plan assets, deferring over three years the impact on these amounts of asset gains or losses that differed from expected returns. 3M changed to the fair value approach for calculating market-related value for the fixed income class of plan assets, which does not involve deferring the impact of excess plan asset gains or losses in the determination of these two components of net periodic benefit cost. 3M considers the use of the fair value approach preferable to the calculated value approach as it results in a more current reflection of impacts of changes in value of these plan assets in the determination of net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, given the plans' liability-driven investment strategy whereby the changes in value of the fixed income plan assets should offset changes in the value of the plans' liabilities, this approach more closely aligns the expected return on plan assets expense component with the value reflected in the plans' funded status. This change was applied retrospectively to all periods presented within 3M's financial statements. The change did not impact consolidated operating income or net cash provided by operating activities but did impact the previously reported portion of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit) that was included within non-operating other expense (income) along with related consolidated income items such as net income and earnings per share. Other impacts included related changes to previously reported consolidated other comprehensive income, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and associated line items within the determination of net cash provided by operating activities. For classes of plan assets other than fixed income investments, the Company continues to use the calculated value approach to determine their market-related value.",

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) highlights that R&D spending positively impacts its business, though specific figures are not disclosed, indicating a strategic emphasis on innovation as a growth lever. Caterpillar (CAT) notes that macroeconomic volatility, including commodity price fluctuations and economic weakness in key sectors like mining and energy, negatively impacts its business environment, indirectly constraining its ability to invest in R&D. Raytheon Technologies (RTX) reports a $0.3 billion increase in customer-funded R&D in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by military programs like the F135 Engine Core Upgrade and commercial development at Pratt & Whitney, showing a strong alignment with defense and aerospace demand trends. Together, these perspectives reveal that while RTX is leveraging external funding to scale R&D in defense and aviation, CAT faces headwinds from economic cycles, and BA sees R&D as a strategic enabler despite opaque quantification.",

It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC RISKS\n\n## Our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.\n\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve.  The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business  investment,  lower  levels  of  business  confidence,  lower  corporate  earnings,  high  real  interest  rates,  lower  credit  activity  or  tighter  credit  conditions, perceived or  actual  industry  overcapacity,  higher  unemployment  and  lower  consumer  spending. A  prolonged  period  of  economic  weakness  may  also  result  in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges.  Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment.  Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe energy, transportation, and mining industries are significant adopters of Caterpillar products. In these industries customers are likely to base their purchase decisions upon expected future commodity dynamics, including price. Commodity price volatility may be abrupt and unpredictable in response to global economic conditions,  government  actions,  regulatory  changes,  supply/demand  dynamics,  innovation,  and  commodity  substitutions  among  others.  Economic  conditions affecting the industries we serve may reduce capital expenditures in response to a variety of the aforementioned conditions. Reduction in these capital expenditures may lead to decreased demand for Caterpillar products and services as well as aftermarket parts as customers may choose to extend preventative maintenance and delay overhauls when possible.\n\nThe rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results.  Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.\n\n## Catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n\nThe occurrence  of  a  major  earthquake,  fire,  flood,  tsunami  or  other  weather  event,  power  loss,  telecommunications  failure,  software  or  hardware  malfunctions, pandemics, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could adversely affect our employees, our systems, our ability to produce and distribute our products, and our reputation. Pandemics can have a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures could include travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. Those measures could impact all or portions of our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers, dealers and suppliers. Material and component shortages, logistics constraints and labor inefficiencies could limit our ability to meet customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n\nThese catastrophic events can significantly increase economic and customer demand uncertainty, cause inflationary pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere and lead to volatility in customer demand for the Company's products and services and cause supply chain disruptions. Economic uncertainties could affect customer demand for the Company's products and services, the value of the equipment financed or leased, the demand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers.\n\nA catastrophic event resulting in the destruction or disruption of our workforce, our systems, our ability to produce and distribute our products, any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results or cash flows. The adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event.\n\nCommodity  price  changes,  material  price  increases,  fluctuations  in  demand  for  our  products  and  serv ices,  significant  disruptions  to  our  supply  chains  or significant shortages of labor and material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.\n\nWe are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial",

In  testing  goodwill  and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual  results  differ  from  such  estimates  and  assumptions.  To  address  this  uncertainty,  we  perform  sensitivity  analyses  on  key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. Any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value.\n\nFinite-Lived  Intangible  Assets -The determination  of  useful  lives  (for  depreciation/amortization  purposes)  and  whether  or  not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our  financial  condition  or  operating  performance  if  actual  results  differ  from  such  estimates  and  assumptions.  We  evaluate  the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows:\n\n- Significant  under-performance  (i.e.,  declines  in  sales,  earnings  or  cash  flows)  of  a  business  or  product  line  in  relation  to expectations;\n- Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;\n- Significant negative industry or economic trends; or\n- Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.\n\nOnce  it  is  determined  that  an  impairment  review  is  necessary,  recoverability  of  assets  is  measured  by  comparing  the  carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted  cash  flows,  the  asset  grouping  is  considered  to  be  impaired.  The  impairment  is  then  measured  as  the  difference between  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  grouping  and  its  fair  value.  We  endeavor  to  utilize  the  best  information  available  to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations.\n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans -We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial  reporting  purposes,  net  periodic  pension  (income)  expense  is  calculated  annually  based  upon  various  actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension ongoing (income) expense) and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment).\n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following:\n\n",

      "answer": "Caterpillar discloses that its environmental remediation accruals are not material and are included in Accrued Expenses, with a specific fine in Brazil estimated at $300,000. Honeywell provides historical data showing environmental payments averaging around $215 million annually from 2019\u20132021. Raytheon Technologies reports a consistent $834\u2013835 million reserve for environmental remediation as of the end of 2021 and 2020. These figures indicate that while CAT views its liabilities as immaterial, HON has ongoing moderate-level obligations, and RTX maintains a significantly higher reserve, suggesting differing scales and strategic treatments of legacy environmental costs.",

Environmental and legal matters\n\nThe Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing its use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal  combustion  engines.  We  have  made,  and  will  continue  to  make,  significant  research  and  development  and  capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.\n\nWe are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When  it  is  probable  we  will  pay  remedial  costs  at  a  site,  and  those  costs  can  be  reasonably  estimated,  we  accrue  the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs against our earnings. We accrue costs based on consideration of  currently  available  data  and  information  with  respect  to  each  individual  site,  including  available  technologies,  current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance  companies  or  others.  We  reassess  these  accrued  amounts  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  amount  recorded  for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.\n\nOn  January  27,  2020,  the  Brazilian  Federal  Environmental Agency  ('IBAMA')  issued  Caterpillar  Brasil  Ltda  a  notice  of violation  regarding  allegations  around  the  requirements  for  use  of  imported  oils  at  the  Piracicaba,  Brazil  facility.  We  have instituted processes to address the allegations. While we are still discussing resolution of these allegations with IBAMA, the initial notice from IBAMA included a proposed fine of approximately $300,000.  We do not expect this fine or our response to address the allegations to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.",

Raytheon Technologies accrues environmental remediation costs based on the most likely cost to be incurred at each site and factors in its expected recovery from U.S. government contracts, recording future recoveries as assets. While all three companies recognize environmental liabilities and use accrual accounting, they differ in how they estimate and disclose the financial impact, with General Dynamics and Raytheon relying on government cost recovery and Raytheon additionally discounting liabilities when future payments are fixed, whereas 3M emphasizes the uncertainty and contingent nature of its liabilities through a complex multi-party arrangement.",

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\n## Litigation\n\nIn  2015,  Electric  Boat  Corporation,  a  subsidiary  of  General  Dynamics  Corporation,  received  a  Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding an investigation of potential False Claims Act  violations  relating  to  alleged  failures  of  Electric  Boat's  quality  system  with  respect  to  allegedly  nonconforming parts purchased from a supplier. In 2016, Electric Boat was made aware that it is a defendant in a lawsuit related to this matter which had been filed under seal in U.S. district court. Also in 2016, the Suspending and  Debarring  Official  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Navy  issued  a  Show  Cause  Letter  to  Electric  Boat requesting  that  Electric  Boat  respond  to  the  official's  concerns  regarding  Electric  Boat's  oversight  and management  with  respect  to  its  quality  assurance  systems  for  subcontractors  and  suppliers.  Electric  Boat responded to the Show Cause Letter and engaged in discussions with the U.S. government.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Department of Justice declined to intervene in the qui tam action, noting that its investigation continues, and the court unsealed the relator's complaint. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the relator  filed  a  second  amended  complaint.  In  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  the  court  dismissed  the  relator's complaint with prejudice. The relator has appealed the dismissal of the complaint to the United States Court of Appeals.  Given  the  current  status  of  these  matters,  we  are  unable  to  express  a  view  regarding  the  ultimate outcome or, if the outcome is adverse, to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss. Depending on the outcome of these matters, there could be a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nAdditionally,  various  other  claims  and  legal  proceedings  incidental  to  the  normal  course  of  business  are pending or threatened against us. These other matters relate to such issues as government investigations and claims, the protection of the environment, asbestos-related claims and employee-related matters. The nature of litigation  is  such  that  we  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  these  other  matters.  However,  based  on  information currently  available,  we  believe  any  potential  liabilities  in  these  other  proceedings,  individually  or  in  the aggregate, will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Environmental\n\nWe  are  subject  to  and  affected  by  a  variety  of  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  environmental  laws  and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current  and  former  facilities  and  third-party  sites  that  we  do  not  own  but  where  we  have  been  designated  a potentially  responsible  party  (PRP)  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  or  a  state  environmental agency.  Based  on  historical  experience,  we  expect  that  a  significant  percentage  of  the  total  remediation  and compliance  costs  associated  with  these  facilities  will  continue  to  be  allowable  contract  costs  and,  therefore, recoverable under U.S. government contracts.\n\nAs  required,  we  provide  financial  assurance  for  certain  sites  undergoing  or  subject  to  investigation  or remediation.  We  accrue  environmental  costs  when  it  is  probable  that  a  liability  has  been  incurred  and  the amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Where  applicable,  we  seek  insurance  recovery  for  costs  related  to environmental liabilities. We do not record insurance recoveries before collection is considered probable. Based on all known facts and analyses, we do not believe that our liability at any individual site, or in the aggregate, arising from such environmental conditions will be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $46 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related and coal mine dust claims. This accrual represents the Company's best estimate of Aearo's probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against Aearo approaching the year 2050. The accrual reflects the Company's assessment of pending and expected lawsuits, its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, and the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the 'Payor Group'). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the 'AO Safety' brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff.\n\nAearo's share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo's potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\n\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo's share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.\n\nBecause of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo's liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\n\n## Environmental Matters and Litigation\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private parties in the United States and abroad. These laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.\n\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. The Company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability. Please refer to the section entitled ' Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables' that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.",

Cash receipts or payments related to the settlement of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded as investing cash flows within the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Cash  Flows.  Additional  information  pertaining  to  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  and  net investment hedging is included in 'Note 15: Financial Instruments.'\n\nEnvironmental . Environmental investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation  of  currently  available  facts  with  respect  to  each  individual  site,  including  existing  technology,  current  laws  and regulations and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. For sites with multiple responsible parties, we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs. Liabilities with fixed or reliably determinable future cash payments are discounted. A portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs, which requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity with the U.S. government.  We  consider  such  recovery  probable  based  on  government  contracting  regulations  and  our  history  of  receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within Other  assets  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  Accrued  environmental  liabilities  are  not  reduced  by  potential  insurance reimbursements  or  potential  recoveries  from  pursuing  other  parties.  We  also  lease  certain  government-owned  properties  and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See 'Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies' for additional details on the environmental remediation activities.\n\nPension and Postretirement Obligations. U.S. GAAP requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) plans. Funded status is measured at least annually in the fourth quarter and represents the difference between the plans' projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair market value of the plans' assets.\n\nChanges to our pension and PRB plans' funded status can result from company actions, such as contributions or changes in plan provisions, or by gains and losses. Gains and losses are primarily a result of changes in assumptions and actual experience that differs from these assumptions. Major assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets (EROA). These gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit (income) expense.\n\nA  calculated  'market-related  value'  of  our  plan  assets  is  used  to  develop  the  amount  of  deferred  asset  gains  or  losses  to  be amortized. The market-related value of assets is equal to the fair value of assets adjusted to reflect the recognition, and subsequent amortization, of the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five-year period. The market-related value of assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets included in the net periodic benefit (income) expense.\n\nThe  Company  has  elected  to  use  the  'corridor'  approach  in  the  amortization  of  gains  and  losses,  which  limits  the  expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of the PBO or 10% of the market-related value of assets. Gains and losses exceeding the corridor are amortized in net periodic benefit (income) expense over either the projected average remaining employee service period or the projected average remaining lifetime of inactive participants depending on the plan.\n\nNet periodic benefit (income) expense is classified between operating and non-operating, whereby only the service cost component is included in operating profit and the remaining components are included in Non-service pension (income) expense.\n\nProduct  Performance  Obligations. We  extend  performance  and  operating  cost  guarantees  beyond  our  normal  service  and warranty  policies  for  extended  periods  on  some  of  our  products,  particularly  commercial  aircraft  engines.  Liability  under  such guarantees  is  based  upon  future  product  performance  and  durability.  We  accrue  for  such  costs  that  are  probable  and  can  be reasonably estimated. In  addition,  we  incur  discretionary  costs  to  service  our  products  in  connection  with  product  performance issues. The costs associated with these product performance and operating cost guarantees require estimates over the full terms of the  agreements,  and  require  management  to  consider  factors  such  as  the  extent  of  future  maintenance  requirements,  interval between flight and repair time and the future cost of material and labor to perform the services.

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) highlights its disclosure of the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for pensions and APBO for other postretirement benefits, indicating a structured reporting of long-term obligations. FedEx (FDX) reveals that its U.S. pension plan's PBO exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $26,284 million in 2024 (vs. $26,426 million in 2023), showing a slight improvement in funded status. Raytheon Technologies (RTX) reports a PBO discount rate of 5.1% in 2023 (down from 5.5% in 2022), reflecting a strategic shift in liability valuation assumptions.

      "answer": "Caterpillar (CAT) emphasizes a mark-to-market approach for recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings, with a detailed focus on assumptions like discount rates derived from high-quality bond yield curves and expected long-term returns based on asset allocation. Honeywell (HON) reports on the components of its net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive loss, indicating a structured accounting treatment of its pension and postretirement obligations. 3M (MMM) focuses on managing its pension and postretirement funds on a going-concern basis, with a strategy that includes long-duration cash bonds and derivatives to hedge interest rate risk, and a target strategic asset allocation with acceptable deviation ranges. Together, these approaches show CAT prioritizing transparency and immediate recognition of actuarial changes, HON focusing on the structured reporting of benefit costs, and MMM emphasizing risk mitigation through asset-liability matching and strategic allocation.",

Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. As a result of these transactions, the equity interest and note receiv able are reported as held-for-sale in the prior year, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, hav e been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented, and cash flows related to U.S. tax distributions hav e been reclassified to operating cash flows from discontinued operations (see Notes 5 and 8).\n\nIn 2024, the Company adopted ASU No. 2022-04 (Subtopic 405-50), Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs, which requires disclosures about the use of supplier finance programs. This standard has no impact on the accounting for supplier finance programs and did not materially impact the Company's disclosures.\n\nIn 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2021-10 (Topic 832), Government Assistance, which requires annual disclosures about certain types of government assistance receiv ed. This standard has no impact on the accounting for gov ernment assistance and did not materially impact the Company's disclosures.\n\nIn 2022, the Company adopted three accounting standard updates, each of which had an immaterial or no impact on the Company's financial statements. These included:\n\n- Updates to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations , which clarify the accounting for contract assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In general, this will result in contract liabilities being recognized at their historical amounts under ASC 606, rather than at fair v alue in accordance with the general requirements of ASC 805.\n- Updates to ASC 740, Income Taxes , which require the recognition of a franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax with any incremental amount as a non-income based tax. These updates also make certain changes to intra-period tax allocation principles and interim tax calculations.\n- Updates to ASC 321, Equity Securities , ASC 323 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures , and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , which clarify how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when ev aluating observ able transactions.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled affiliates. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Inv estments of 20 percent to 50 percent of the v oting shares of other entities are accounted for by the equity method. Inv estments in publicly traded companies of less than 20 percent are carried at fair v alue, with changes in fair v alue reflected in earnings. Inv estments in nonpublicly traded companies of less than 20 percent are carried at cost, minus impairment, and adjusted for observ able price changes in orderly transactions.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nThe functional currency for most of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in accumulated other comprehensiv e income.",

The organizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. During the implementation process in 2024, each of our reportable segments continued to have discrete financial information that was regularly reviewed when evaluating performance and making resource allocation decisions, and aligned with our management reporting structure and our internal financial reporting. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our reportable segments will be Federal Ex press Corporation and FedEx Freight. Additionally, the results of FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. will be included in the FedEx Freight segment instead of the Federal Express segment. This change was made to reflect our new management reporting structure. Prior-year amounts will be revised to reflect this presentation.\n\nReferences to our transportation segments include, collectively, the FedEx Express segment, the FedEx Ground segment, and the FedEx Freight segment.\n\n## FedEx Services Segment\n\nDuring 2024, 2023, and 2022, the FedEx Services segment operated combined sales, marketing, administrative, and information-technology functions in shared services operations for U.S. customers of our major business units and certain back-office support to our operating segments which allowed us to obtain synergies from the combination of these functions. For the international regions of FedEx Express, some of these functions were performed on a regional basis and reported by FedEx Express in their natural ex pense line items.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GA A P), which requires us to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements. A lthough our current estimates contemplate current and expected future conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such changes could result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets, contract assets and investment securities, revisions to estimated profitability on long-term product service agreements, incremental credit losses on receivables and debt securities, incremental losses related to our contingencies, a change in the carrying amount of our tax assets and liabilities, or a change in our insurance liabilities and pension obligations as of the time of a relevant measurement event.\n\nIn preparing our Statement of Cash Flows, we make certain adjustments to reflect cash flows that cannot otherwise be calculated by changes in our Statement of Financial Position. These adjustments may include, but are not limited to, the effects of currency exchange, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, businesses classified as held for sale, the timing of settlements to suppliers for property, plant and equipment, non-cash gains/losses and other balance sheet reclassifications.\n\nWe have reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year's presentation. Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for earnings from continuing operations, earnings from discontinued operations and net earnings. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total. Unless otherwise indicated, information in these notes to consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Certain of our operations have been presented as discontinued. We present businesses whose disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results as discontinued operations when the components meet the criteria for held for sale, are sold, or spun-off.\n\nOn April 2, 2024 and January 3, 2023, General Electric Company, now operating as GE A erospace, completed the previously announced separation of GE Vernova and its separation of GE HealthCare, respectively, which resulted in three independent, publicly traded companies - GE A erospace, GE V ernova and GE HealthCare. We are organized into two business segments that are aligned with the industries we serve: Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies. The historical results of GE V ernova and GE HealthCare are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. See Notes 2 and 25 for further information.\n\nCONSOLIDATION. Our financial statements consolidate all of our affiliates, entities where we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest, or where we are required to apply the variable interest entity (V IE) model and we have the power to direct the most economically significant activities of entities. We reev aluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in all entities when our rights and interests change. A ll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nREVENUE FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT. We recognize revenue for equipment including commercial install and spare aircraft engines, defense aircraft engines, and other products we manufacture at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (time between shipment and delivery).\n\nWhere arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment, and that acceptance is likely to occur. We do not provide for anticipated losses on point-in-time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.\n\nOur billing terms for these contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer. We sometimes offer our customers financing discounts for the purchase of certain equipment when sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements. These sales are accounted for as financing arrangements when payments for the equipment are collected through higher usage-based fees from servicing the equipment. In some contracts, we receive progress collections from customers for large equipment purchases. Progress collections are not considered a significant financing component as they are used to meet working capital demands and protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. For certain commercial engine programs, we make payments to airlines when the aircraft with our engines are delivered by the airframers (aircraft allowances). We record aircraft allowances as a reduction in revenue when control of the engine is transferred to our airframer customer.\n\nSome of our contracts require us to make payments to customers related to failure to deliver our equipment on-time or meeting certain performance specifications, which is factored into our estimate of variable consideration using the expected value method taking into consideration performance relative to our contractual obligations, specified liquidated damages rates, if applicable, and history of paying damages to the customer or similar customers.\n\nREVENUE FROM THE SALE OF SERVICES. Spare Parts. We sell certain tangible products, largely spare parts, through our services businesses. We recognize revenue and bill our customers at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is when we deliver the spare part to the customer. In some cases, our contracts give rise to variable consideration in the form of volume or product durability discounts, which we incorporate into our estimate of transaction price using the expected value method. Delivery is measured using either proof of delivery or estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (time between shipment and delivery).",

      "question": "How do EMR, GD, and UPS differ in their disclosures regarding unfunded commitments related to private equity and pension investments, and what does this reveal about their respective risk exposure and liquidity management strategies?",
      "answer": "EMR disclosed $190 million in unfunded commitments for private equity funds as of September 30, 2022, with distributions expected over the next 10 years and no redemption rights. GD noted that its unfunded commitments related to pension investments were not material as of December 31, 2021 or 2020, and its Level 3 assets include real estate funds and insurance contracts with monthly or quarterly redemption rights. UPS reported no unfunded commitments with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2021, indicating a more liquid investment posture. These differences suggest that EMR has longer-term, less liquid commitments, GD maintains a moderate and non-material exposure, and UPS avoids such commitments entirely, favoring more liquid alternatives.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Asset Classes\n\nU.S. equities reflect companies domiciled in the U.S., including multinational companies. International equities are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S. Emerging market equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds represent investmentgrade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S. Government bonds include investment-grade instruments issued by federal, state and local governments, primarily in the U.S. Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds investing in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general investment funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or provide for a small minimum return guarantee.\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy Categories\n\nValuations of Level 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal exchanges where the individual securities are traded. Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Debt securities categorized as Level 2 assets are generally valued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities having similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prevailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Level 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund investments and insurance arrangements are Level 3. Investments measured at NAV are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collective funds where the underlying securities have observable prices available from active markets and typically provide liquidity daily or within a few days. The NAV category also includes fund investments in private equities, real estate and infrastructure where the fair value of the underlying assets is determined by the investment manager. Total unfunded commitments for the private equity funds were approximately $190 at September 30, 2022. These investments cannot be redeemed, but instead the funds will make distributions through liquidation of the underlying assets, which is expected to occur over approximately the next 10 years. The real estate and infrastructure funds typically offer quarterly redemption.\n\n## Postretirement Plans\n\nThe Company also sponsors unfunded postretirement benefit plans (primarily health care) for certain U.S. retirees and their dependents. The Company's principal U.S. postretirement plan has been frozen to new employees since 1993. The postretirement benefit liability for all plans was $83 and $119 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and included deferred actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income of $112 and $98, respectively. Service and interest costs are negligible and more than offset by the amortization of deferred actuarial gains, which resulted in net postretirement income of $12 for 2022 and $15 for 2021 and $12 for 2020.

Our  Level  1  assets  include  investments  in  publicly  traded  equity  securities.  These securities are actively traded and valued using quoted prices for identical securities from the market exchanges. Our Level 2 assets include fixed-income securities and commingled funds whose underlying investments are valued using observable marketplace inputs. The fair value of plan assets invested in fixed-income securities is generally determined under a market approach using valuation models that incorporate observable inputs such as  interest  rates,  bond  yields  and  quoted  prices  for  similar  assets.  Our  plan  assets  that  are  invested  in commingled  funds  are  valued  using  a  unit  price  or  net  asset  value  (NA V)  that  is  based  on  the  underlying investments of the fund.

      "answer": "EMR reports a net carrying amount of capitalized software at $239 million in 2024, up from $203 million in 2023, indicating a modest increase in both asset value and amortization. LMT reports capitalized software at $1.9 billion net of accumulated amortization of $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2024, with amortization expense of $346 million in 2024, showing a significant investment in internal-use software and a consistent amortization policy over a 2-15 year range. UPS specifies that capitalized software is generally amortized over 7 years, suggesting a standardized approach aligned with industry norms. The differences in scale and amortization periods reflect varying strategic emphasis on software capitalization, with LMT having the highest capitalized value and EMR showing the smallest investment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nContract liabilities -  Contract liabilities include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.\n\nInventories - We record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The majority of our inventory represents work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the customer. Work-in-process primarily consists of labor, material, subcontractor, and overhead costs.  In addition, costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of the contract being awarded are recorded in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that those costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable (referred to as pre-contract costs). Pre-contract costs that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of sales consistent with the transfer of products and services to the customer upon the receipt of the anticipated contract. All other precontract costs, including start-up costs, are expensed as incurred. We determine the costs of other inventories such as materials, spares and supplies by using the first-in  first-out  or  average  cost  methods.  If  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  pre-contract  costs  are  no  longer  recoverable  or  the  utility  of  our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in which it occurs.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. The cost of plant and equipment are depreciated generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straight-line method thereafter. The estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment. No depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such assets are placed into operation.\n\nWe review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We assess impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related asset grouping to its carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount.\n\nCapitalized software - We capitalize certain costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software. The amounts capitalized are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software, which ranges from two to 15 years. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, capitalized software totaled $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, net of accumulated amortization of $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion. No amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for its intended use. Amortization expense related to capitalized software was $346 million in 2024, $263 million in 2023 and $253 million in 2022.\n\nFair value of financial instruments -  We measure the fair value of our financial instruments using observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. The following hierarchy classifies the inputs used to determine fair value into three levels:\n\n- Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 - inputs, other than quoted prices, observable by a marketplace participant either directly or indirectly.\n- Level 3 - unobservable inputs significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nInvestments - We  hold  a  portfolio  of  marketable  securities  to  fund  our  non-qualified  employee  benefit  plans.  A  portion  of  these  securities  are  held  in common/collective trust funds and are measured at fair value using Net Asset V alue (NAV ) per share as a practical expedient. Marketable securities accounted for as trading are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. G ains and losses on these investments are included in other unallocated, net within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nWe make investments in companies that we believe are advancing or developing new technologies applicable to our business. These investments are primarily in early-stage  companies  and  may  be  in  the  form  of  common  or  preferred  stock,  warrants,  convertible  debt securities,  investments  in  funds  or  equity  method investments. Most of these investments are in equity securities without readily determinable fair values (privately held securities), which are measured initially at cost and are then adjusted to fair value only if there is an observable price change or reduced for impairment, if applicable. The carrying amounts of the investments were $600 million and $581 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and are included on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets, both current and noncurrent.  Changes in fair  value  and/or  sales  of  investments  are  reflected  in  the  other  non-operating  income,  net  account  on  our  consolidated  statements  of earnings. We recorded net gains of $22 million ($17 million, or $0.07 per share, after-tax), net losses of $64 million ($48 million, or $0.19 per share, after-tax) and $114 million ($86 million, or $0.33 per share, after-tax ) during 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, licenses, patents, customer lists, non-compete agreements and franchise rights are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 21 years. Capitalized software is generally amortized over 7 years. Finite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment as part of asset groups whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Assets Held for Sale\n\nWe classify long-lived assets or disposal groups as held for sale in the period when all of the following conditions have been met:\n\n- we have approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets or disposal group;\n- the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition;\n- an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the sale have been initiated;\n- the sale of the asset or disposal group is probable and expected to be completed within one year;\n- the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and\n- it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nWe initially measure a long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell and recognize any loss in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. G ains are not recognized until the date of sale. We cease depreciation and amortization of a long-lived asset, or assets within a disposal group, upon their designation as held for sale and subsequently assess fair value less any costs to sell at each reporting date until the asset or disposal group is no longer classified as held for sale.\n\n## Supplier Finance Programs\n\nAs part of our working capital management, certain financial institutions offer a Supply Chain Finance (\"SCF\") program to certain of our suppliers. We agree to commercial terms with our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Suppliers issue invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. If they participate in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by us under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program.\n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets.

      "question": "How do Honeywell (HON), Lockheed Martin (LMT), and 3M (MMM) each approach the financial management of postretirement benefit plans, and what does this reveal about their respective risk mitigation strategies and funding priorities?",
      "answer": "Honeywell (HON) reports the components of net periodic benefit (income) cost and other amounts recognized in Other Comprehensive (Income) Loss for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, indicating a structured accounting approach to these obligations. Lockheed Martin (LMT) highlights the significance of postretirement benefit plans in its accounting estimates, emphasizing the role of assumptions in determining liabilities. 3M (MMM) actively manages its pension and postretirement benefit funds on a going-concern basis, using long-duration cash bonds and derivatives to hedge interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities, and maintains a strategic asset allocation with regular rebalancing when deviations exceed acceptable ranges. Together, these approaches reveal that HON focuses on transparent disclosure of benefit costs, LMT integrates postretirement obligations into broader financial risk assessments, and MMM emphasizes asset-liability matching and active risk management to reduce contribution volatility.",

      "answer": "GD emphasizes that their revenue recognition for defense contracts depends heavily on customer funding availability, using incurred costs relative to total estimated costs to measure progress. HON discloses that customer funding for nonrecurring engineering and development activities is deferred and recognized as revenue upon product delivery, with capitalized contract fulfillment costs reaching $1.3 billion as of 2021. RTX notes that customer funding timing is a key assumption in estimating contract revenues and costs, and that changes in funding assumptions could materially affect their financial results. Together, this shows that all three companies rely on customer funding for revenue recognition in long-term contracts, but differ in how they account for and defer revenue based on funding milestones, indicating varying degrees of financial risk exposure tied to funding delays.",

We  employ  judgment  in  making  our  estimates,  but  they  are  based  on historical  experience,  currently  available  information  and  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe our judgment is applied  consistently  and  produces  financial  information  that  fairly  depicts  our  results  of  operations  for  all periods presented.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  following  policies  are  critical  and  require  the  use  of  significant  judgment  in  their application:\n\nRevenue. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer,  and  is  the  unit  of  account  for  revenue. A  contract's  transaction  price  is  allocated  to  each  distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time.\n\nSubstantially  all  of  our  revenue  in  the  defense  segments  is  recognized  over  time,  because  control  is transferred continuously to our customers. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date  relative  to  total  estimated  costs  at  completion  to  measure  progress  toward  satisfying  our  performance obligations.  Incurred  cost  represents  work  performed,  which  corresponds  with,  and  thereby  best  depicts,  the transfer  of  control  to  the  customer.  Contract  costs  include  labor,  material,  overhead  and,  when  appropriate, G&amp;A expenses.\n\nMost  of  our  revenue  recognized  at  a  point  in  time  is  for  the  manufacture  of  business  jet  aircraft  in  our Aerospace segment. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft.\n\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. Accounting  for  long-term  contracts  and  programs  involves  the  use  of  various  techniques  to  estimate  total contract  revenue  and  costs.  For  long-term  contracts,  we  estimate  the  profit  on  a  contract  as  the  difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.\n\nContract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer.\n\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, award fees and incentive fees. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and  the  objective  evidence  available  to  support  the  claim.  We  include  award  fees  or  incentive  fees  in  the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time.\n\nAs a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review  and  update  our  contract-related  estimates  regularly.  We  recognize  adjustments  in  estimated  profit  on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of",

          "chunk_text": "## HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\n## SALES RECOGNITION\n\nProduct and service sales are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to its customers.  Revenue  is  measured  as  the  amount  of  consideration  the  Company  expects  to  receive  in  exchange  for  transferring goods or providing services. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method. The Company recognizes revenue over time as the Company performs on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company generally uses the cost-to-cost input method of progress for contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs. Under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. The Company reviews its  cost  estimates  on  significant  contracts  on  a  periodic  basis,  or  when  circumstances  change  and  warrant  a  modification  to  a previous estimate. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required.\n\nThe customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of the Company's products under agreements  with  commercial  customers  is  deferred  and  subsequently  recognized  as  revenue  as  products  are  delivered  to  the customers. Additionally, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer. The deferred customer funding and costs result in recognition of deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The amounts recognized as Cost of products and services sold were approximately $0.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nRevenues for the Company's mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations that are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method.\n\nThe terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cashbased incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits. The Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount the  Company will  receive  from  customers. The  Company  includes  estimated  amounts  in  the  transaction  price  to  the  extent  it  is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated  with  the  variable  consideration  is  resolved.  The  Company's  estimates  of  variable  consideration  and  determination  of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\n\n## STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\n\nThe principal awards issued under the Company's stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 15 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on the Company's historical forfeiture rates.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

As  a  result,  we  anticipate  that  we  will  need  to  make  additional  investments  in  new  technologies  and capabilities and devote additional management and other resources in response to the foregoing. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of these investments and actions for a variety of reasons, including technological challenges, evolving government and customer requirements and our ability to anticipate them and develop in-demand technologies on a timely basis, and other risks related  to  the  development  of  advanced  technologies  described  above.  In  addition,  certain  technologies  will  be  dependent  upon government action, such as investments in infrastructure, creating appropriate market incentives and making certain raw materials available for development of certain technologies. Moreover we will rely on our suppliers to timely and effectively adapt and meet our evolving technological supply needs. We also face competition risks as our competitors also respond to advancing sustainable technologies. Our competitors may develop these in-demand technologies before we do, their new technologies may be deemed by our customers to be superior to technologies we may develop, and their technologies may otherwise gain industry acceptance in advance  of  or  instead  of  our  products.  In  addition,  as  we  and  our  competitors  develop  increasingly  sustainable  technologies, demand for  our  older  offerings  may  decrease  or  become  nonexistent.  Moreover,  our  business,  the  businesses  of  our  suppliers, subcontractors, service providers, distributors and customers, and the industries in which we operate could be negatively impacted by increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events caused by climate change, including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, snow and ice  storms,  fires,  heat  waves,  droughts  and  mud  slides.  These  events  could  damage  our  and  our  suppliers'  facilities, products and other assets, and cause disruptions to our business and operations, supply chain and distribution networks, and the businesses of our customers. Any of the foregoing could materially decrease our revenues and materially increase our costs and expenses.\n\n## FINANCIAL, TAX AND INSURANCE RELATED RISKS\n\nWe Use Estimates in Accounting For Many of Our Programs, and Changes in our Estimates Could Adversely Affect Our Future Financial Results. Accounting for long-term contracts and related assets requires estimates and judgments related to our progress toward completion and the long-term performance on the contract. Significant judgments include potential risks associated with the ability  and  cost  to  achieve  program  schedule,  including  customer-directed  delays  or  reductions  in  scheduled  deliveries,  and technical and other specific contract requirements including customer activity levels and variable consideration based upon that activity. Due to the size and long-term nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost (such as estimates of variable consideration, including award fees and penalties), including with respect to: (1) labor productivity and availability; (2) the complexity and scope of the work to be performed; (3) the availability and cost of materials; (4) the length of time to complete the performance obligation; (5) execution by our subcontractors; (6) the availability and timing of funding from our customer; (7) overhead cost rates; and (8) current and past service cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization  and  estimated  useful  lives  of  components,  among  other  variables.  Because  of  the  significance  of  management's judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different  assumptions  or  if  the  underlying  circumstances  were  to  change.  Changes  in  underlying  assumptions,  circumstances  or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nSignificant Changes in Key Estimates and Assumptions, Such as Discount Rates and Expected Return on Plan Assets (EROA), as well as Our Actual Investment Returns on Our Pension Plan Assets and Other Actuarial Factors, Could Affect Our Earnings, Equity and Pension Contributions in Future Periods. We must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit (PRB) plans'  expense  or  income,  which  involves  significant  judgment  particularly  with  respect  to  our  discount  rate,  EROA  and  other actuarial assumptions. These assumptions are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. They may change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, regulatory, and/or demographic experience or circumstances. Changes in our assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions could impact our pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense, the plans' funded status, and/or the required cash contributions to such plans,  which  could  negatively  impact  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  liquidity.  Our  plan  assets  are  invested  in accordance with our investment management objectives and are subject to market volatility and other conditions.\n\nAdditional Tax Expense or Additional Tax Exposures Could Affect Our Future Profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the  United  States  and  international  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  our  worldwide  provision  for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance, and  fluctuations  in  taxable  income  could  materially  impact  our  tax  receivables  and  liabilities  and  our  deferred  tax  assets  and deferred tax liabilities, as well as our income tax expense and tax payments.

          "chunk_text": "## LONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist. If the Company determines that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk. Estimates of future sales, operating results, cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including such factors as the general level of market interest rates, expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served, particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time.\n\n## RETIREMENT PLANS\n\nThe Company maintains a prudent long-term investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations. The determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions, including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the Company's assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods. The Company's principal U.S. defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $513 in total (approximately 16 percent in excess of the projected benefit obligation), including unfunded plans totaling $162. The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $57, including unfunded plans totaling $236. The Company contributed a total of $43 to defined benefit plans in 2022 and expects to contribute approximately $40 in 2023. At year-end 2022, the discount rate for U.S. plans was 5.64 percent, and was 2.92 percent in 2021. The assumed investment return on plan assets was 6.00 percent in 2022, 6.50 percent in 2021 and 6.75 percent in 2020, and will be 6.00 percent for 2023. While management believes its assumptions used are appropriate, actual experience may differ. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the U.S. and non-U.S. discount rates would have increased the total projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2022 by $100 and increased fiscal 2023 pension expense by $15. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase fiscal 2023 pension expense by $15. See Note 12.\n\n## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nThe Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos) and other matters, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivables. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. See Note 13.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid (received) on items included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the",

We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense and, if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The balance of accrued interest and penalties was $55 million on May 31, 2022 and $61 million on May 31, 2021. Our consolidated statements of income for 2021 include $20 million of interest expense associated with our uncertain tax positions while interest and penalty expense for 2022 and 2020 are immaterial.\n\nIt is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions. Changes may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits, appeals, or litigation in state, local, federal, and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the resolution of various proceedings between U.S. and foreign tax authorities. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months. However, estimates of the amounts or ranges for individual matters where a material change is reasonably possible cannot be made. We believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax reserves, including interest and penalties, for any adjustments that may occur.\n\n## NOTE 14: RETIREMENT PLANS\n\nWe sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and postretirement healthcare plans.\n\nThe accounting guidance related to postretirement benefits requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in either expense or AOCI of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. We use MTM accounting for the recognition of our actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans as described in Note 1. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan's assets and the PBO of the plan.\n\nA summary of our retirement plan costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## International Pension Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor various defined benefit plans covering certain of our international employees. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit plans in Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, many of our international employees are covered by government-sponsored retirement and pension plans. We are not directly responsible for providing benefits to participants of government-sponsored plans.\n\n## U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor postretirement medical plans in the U.S. that provide healthcare benefits to our non-union retirees, as well as select union retirees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who are not otherwise covered by multiemployer plans. Generally, this includes employees with at least 10 years of service who have reached age 55 and employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits from a Company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans. These benefits have been provided to certain retirees on a noncontributory basis; however, in many cases, retirees are required to contribute all or a portion of the total cost of the coverage.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nWe sponsor a defined contribution plan for employees not covered under collective bargaining agreements, and several smaller defined contribution plans for certain employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. We match, in shares of UPS common stock or cash, a portion of the participating employees' contributions. Matching contributions charged to expense were $153, $139 and $130 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nIn addition to current benefits under the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan, non-union employees hired after July 1, 2016, receive a retirement contribution. UPS contributes 3% to 8% of eligible pay to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service and business unit. Contributions under this plan are subject to maximum compensation and contribution limits for a taxqualified defined contribution plan as prescribed by the IRS. The UPS Restoration Savings Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above. Contributions charged to expense were $107, $84 and $67 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nOn June 23, 2017, the Company amended the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan so that non-union employees who currently participate in the UPS Retirement Plan will, in addition to current benefits under the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan, earn a retirement contribution beginning January 1, 2023. UPS will contribute 5% to 8% of eligible compensation to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service. The amendment also provides for transition contributions for certain participants. There was no impact to the statements of consolidated income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 as a result of this change.\n\nContributions are also made to defined contribution money purchase plans under certain collective bargaining agreements. Amounts charged to expense were $112, $107 and $97 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n\nInformation about net periodic benefit cost for the company-sponsored pension and postretirement defined benefit plans is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

HON reported components of its net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss, indicating active accounting and recognition of ongoing pension obligations. MMM outlined a detailed investment strategy focused on long-duration cash bonds and derivatives to hedge interest rate risk, with a goal of balancing return and liability matching.

(Spirit) subjects us to various risks and uncertainties, including risks that we may not complete the acquisition or realize the anticipated benefits in the expected timeframe or at all.\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) to acquire Spirit in an all-stock transaction that will include the assumption of Spirit's net debt at closing. Completion of our acquisition of Spirit is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. On January 31, 2025, Spirit's stockholders approv ed the Merger Agreement and the related transactions. Some of the remaining conditions, such as certain regulatory approv als and the ability of Spirit to enter into definitiv e agreements relating to the disposition of Spirit operations related to certain Airbus commercial work packages and consummate the related transactions, are beyond our control, which make the completion of our acquisition of Spirit  (and  the  timing  thereof)  uncertain.  In  addition,  if  Spirit  or  Boeing  exercise  certain  termination  rights  included  in  the  Merger  Agreement,  the acquisition will not be consummated. Furthermore, the gov ernmental authorities from which regulatory approv als related to the acquisition are required may impose burdensome or unacceptable conditions on the completion of the acquisition, require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement, or prev ent or delay the consummation of the acquisition. If the acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business may be adv ersely affected and we will be subject to a number of risks, including expenditure of time and resources, negativ e reactions from stakeholders, and potential stock price fluctuations. If we are successful in completing the acquisition, we will be subject to other risks, including those related to the assumption of Spirit's net debt and other obligations at closing, which could adv ersely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Difficulties in integrating Spirit may result in the failure to realize anticipated benefits of the acquisition (including anticipated synergies and quality improv ements) in the expected timeframe or at all, as well as operational challenges, the div ersion of management's attention from other ongoing business concerns, and unforeseen expenses, which may  have  an  adv erse  impact  on  our  operations  and  our  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows.  For  additional  information  on  the acquisition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint v entures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions, including our acquisition of Spirit, and related activ ities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and serv ice portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adv ersely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, cybersecurity issues or v ulnerabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint v entures could also impact our reported results of operations  or  financial  position.  We  also  may  make  strategic  div estitures  from  time  to  time.  T hese  transactions  may  result  in  continued  financial inv olv ement in the div ested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those div ested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe face risks relating to our U.S. government contracts and programs, including the mix of our U.S. government contracts and programs, our performance, and our ability to control costs. The termination of one or more of our U.S. government contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns (due to inflation  or  otherwise),  product  failures,  shortages  in  materials,  components,  or  labor,  contract  definitization  delays,  or  other  failures  to  perform  to  customer expectations and contract requirements, could negatively impact our reputation and competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. U.S. government  contracts  with  prime  contractors  generally  permit  the  government  to  terminate  the  contract,  in  whole  or  in  part,  without  prior  notice,  at  the  U.S. government's convenience or for default based on performance. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs, and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some programs, and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We may not be able to offset lost revenues resulting from contract termination. Moreover, because the funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables, and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. The timing of contract definitization can be affected by factors specific to the U.S. government, including staffing limitations. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced, or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve the development, application, and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result of untested or unproven technologies, or modified requirements or specifications, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties (including delays, setbacks, cost overruns, or product failures), our attention or resources may be diverted from other projects, and our future sales opportunities may be impacted. Additionally, as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions, we may be required to invest in development prior to contract award with no guarantee of award.\n\nOur profitability could be negatively affected based on the mix of our U.S. government contracts and programs and the costs incurred of performing the work, especially if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, particularly under fix ed-price development contracts. Our U.S. government contracts are typically either fix ed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fix ed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fix ed-price (FFP) contracts or fix ed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fix ed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur, and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts, which may result in a cumulative adjustment in the period our estimates change. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and are typically paid a fix ed or performance-based fee, but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized costs exceeding a cost ceiling amount or costs not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations. Excess costs on cost reimbursable contracts could also result in lower profit rates. We may incur unexpected costs for various reasons, including technical and manufacturing challenges, schedule delays, the timeliness and availability of materials, components, or labor, the inaccuracy of initial contract cost estimates, internal and subcontractor performance or product quality issues, inability to achieve the benefits of our expected cost reduction, digital transformation, manufacturing, operating, and other strategic initiatives, inflation, inability to pass on tariff costs, and changing laws or regulations, natural disasters, and public health crises. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are often cost reimbursable, they can be FFP or FPI, which can significantly increase our risk of a potential negative profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth.  In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements, under which it awards  certain  prototypes,  research,  and  production  contracts  without  all  of  the  procurement  requirements  that  typically  apply  to  DoD  contracts,  including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracting during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract cost sharing. They may also require non-traditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to bid for OTA work and/or perform on our OTA agreements, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. In addition, in order to support U.S. government priorities, we may begin performance on an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price before completing contract",

      "answer": "Honeywell recorded a pre-tax gain of $95 million from the sale of its retail footwear business, reflecting a strategic move to divest non-core assets. Raytheon Technologies recognized a significant pre-tax gain of $580 million from the sale of its Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses, driven by regulatory requirements following its merger with United Technologies. UPS reported a much smaller pre-tax gain of $46 million from the divestiture of UPS Freight, indicating a more targeted exit from a specific logistics segment rather than a broad portfolio overhaul. Collectively, these figures highlight varying degrees and types of portfolio optimization strategies across the industrials sector, with Honeywell and Raytheon engaging in larger-scale strategic exits, while UPS focused on a more contained restructuring.",

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\n## ACQUISITIONS\n\nOn  November  29,  2021,  Honeywell  Quantum  Solutions,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Honeywell,  and  Cambridge  Quantum Computing, a leading developer of quantum computing and quantum software, combined to form Quantinuum. Prior to closing the transaction, Honeywell held a 4.2% ownership interest in Cambridge Quantum Computing. At closing of the business combination, Honeywell contributed an additional $270 million of cash and is the controlling majority-owner of Quantinuum, with an overall 54% ownership  in  the  business.  Quantinuum  is  well  positioned  to  lead  the  quantum  computing  industry  by  offering  advanced,  fully integrated hardware and software solutions at an unprecedented pace, scale and level of performance to large high-growth markets worldwide. Quantinuum supports customer needs for improved computation in cyber security, drug discovery and delivery, material science, finance, and optimization across all major industrial markets. The business is included within Corporate and All Other, which is not considered a reportable business segment. The combination was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting; as such, assets and liabilities of Quantinuum are consolidated by Honeywell and included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Upon close of the transaction, Honeywell recorded a non-cash adjustment of $460 million in Additional paid-in-capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the contribution of ownership interest in Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum Computing for the formation of Quantinuum. In addition, Honeywell recognized a gain of $22 million related to the fair value remeasurement of Honeywell's existing 4.2% ownership interest in Cambridge Quantum Computing, which was recorded in Other (income) expense on in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Operations.  At  close  of  the  transaction,  the  fair  value  of  Cambridge  Quantum  Computing's noncontrolling interest in Quantinuum was $419 million. In December 2021, Cambridge Quantum Computing contributed cash of $12  million  to  Quantinuum,  increasing  their  noncontrolling  interest  and  decreasing  Honeywell's  additional-paid-in-capital.  As  of December 31, 2021, the assets and liabilities in Honeywell's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $90 million of intangible assets and  $943  million  allocated  to  goodwill,  which  is  non-deductible  for  tax  purposes.  The  purchase  accounting  is  subject  to  final adjustments, primarily for the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the shares outstanding of Sparta Systems, a leading provider of enterprise quality management software for the life sciences industry, for $1,303 million. Sparta Systems is expected to further strengthen the Company's leadership in industrial automation, digital transformation solutions, and enterprise performance management software. The  business  is  included  within  the  Performance  Materials  and  Technologies  segment.  The  assets  and  liabilities  acquired  with Sparta  Systems  are  included  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  as  of  December  31,  2021,  including  $383  million  of  intangible assets and $1,011 million allocated to goodwill, which is nondeductible for tax purposes. The purchase accounting is subject to final adjustment,  primarily  for  the  valuation  of  intangible  assets,  amounts  allocated  to  goodwill,  tax  balances,  and  certain  preacquisition contingencies.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Company  acquired  businesses  for  an  aggregate  cost  (net  of  cash  and  debt  assumed)  of  $261  million,  which included the October 2020 acquisition of Rocky Research and the December 2020 acquisition of Sine Group. Rocky Research is a technology leader specializing in thermal, energy and power management solutions and is included within the Aerospace segment. Sine Group offers a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that handles visitor management, workplace and supply chain solutions and is included  in  the  Honeywell  Building  Technologies  segment.  The  acquisition  of  Rocky  Research  and  Sine  Group  included approximately $167 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes.\n\nDuring 2019, there were no significant acquisitions that closed individually or in the aggregate.\n\n## DIVESTITURES\n\nOn March 15, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its retail footwear business in exchange for gross cash consideration of $230 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $95 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, which was recorded in Other (income) expense. The retail footwear business was previously included in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment.\n\nDuring 2020 and 2019, there were no significant divestitures that closed individually or in the aggregate.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.\n\n63",

This income tax benefit was generated at a lower average tax rate than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the portion of the costs related to goodwill impairment, which is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to share-based compensation in income tax expense resulted in a net tax benefit of $28 million and reduced our effective tax rate by 1.5% during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nOur 2020 effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by new uncertain tax positions.\n\n## 2019 Discrete Items\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized an income tax benefit of $571 million related to pre-tax mark-to-market losses of $2.4 billion on our pension and U.S. postretirement defined benefit plans. This income tax benefit was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2019 U.S. federal statutory tax rate because it included the effect of U.S. state and local and foreign taxes.\n\nWe recorded pre-tax transformation strategy costs of $255 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result, we recorded an additional income tax benefit of $59 million. This income tax benefit was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2019 U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the effect of U.S. state and local and foreign taxes.\n\nLegal contingencies and expenses of $97 million were accrued during 2019 in respect of certain legal proceedings for which we recorded an additional income tax benefit of $6 million. This income tax benefit was generated at a lower average tax rate than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the portion of the accrual related to penalties, which are not deductible for tax purposes.",

      "answer": "Honeywell (HON) highlights that environmental liabilities stem largely from past operations and predecessor companies, and it continues to incur remedial and clean-up costs, with the potential for additional future liabilities due to new regulations or discoveries. Lockheed Martin (LMT) specifically quantifies its exposure to perchlorate and hexavalent chromium regulations, noting that lower regulatory thresholds could materially increase its environmental liabilities, particularly for non-recoverable portions of clean-up costs. 3M (MMM) discloses a $46 million accrual through its Aearo subsidiary for asbestos, silica, and coal mine dust claims, with potential for significant increases depending on legal outcomes, claim volumes, and co-defendant viability. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies face environmental liability risks, their exposure varies in nature\u2014legacy contamination for HON, regulatory-driven costs for LMT, and product liability-linked accruals for MMM\u2014with differing degrees of quantification and mitigation through insurance, contractual arrangements, and reserves.",

          "chunk_text": "## Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.\n\nMainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to  the  remediation  of  environmental  hazards  and  to  claims  of  personal  injuries  or  property  damages  that  may  be  caused  by hazardous  substance  releases  and  exposures.  We  continue  to  incur  remedial  response  and  voluntary  clean-up  costs  for  site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products  containing  hazardous  substances.  Additional  lawsuits,  claims  and  costs  involving  environmental  matters  are  likely  to continue  to  arise  in  the  future.  Various  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  governments  regulate  the  use  of  certain  materials,  the discharge of materials into the environment, and/or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial  fines  and  criminal  sanctions  for  violations,  and  require  injunctive  relief  measures,  including  installation  of  costly equipment,  implementation  of  operational  changes  to  limit  emissions  and/or  decrease  the  likelihood  of  accidental  hazardous substance  releases,  or  limiting  access  of  our  products  to  markets,  among  others.  In  addition,  changes  in  laws,  regulations  and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites,  the  establishment  of  stricter  toxicity  standards  with  respect  to  certain  contaminants,  or  the  imposition  of  new  clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\n\nGlobal  cybersecurity  threats  and  incidents  can  range  from  uncoordinated  individual  attempts  to  gain  unauthorized  access  to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability  assessments,  continuous  monitoring  of  our  IT  networks  and  systems  and  maintenance  of  backup  and  protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents (against us or parties with whom we contract), depending on their nature and scope,  could  potentially  result  in  the  misappropriation,  destruction,  corruption  or  unavailability  of  critical  data  and  confidential  or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material  cybersecurity  incident  and  its  effects  include  financial  loss,  reputational  damage,  litigation  with  third  parties,  theft  of intellectual  property,  fines  levied  by  the  Federal Trade Commission or other government agencies, diminution in the value of our investment  in  research,  development  and  engineering,  and  increased  cybersecurity  protection  and  remediation  costs  due  to  the increasing  sophistication  and  proliferation  of  threats,  which  in  turn  could  adversely  affect  our  competitiveness  and  results  of operations. In addition, cybersecurity laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to reputational damage or litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. While we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\n\n## The development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks.\n\nAn increasing number of our products, services, and technologies are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and the accompanying  interconnected  device  networks,  which  include  sensors,  data  and  advanced  computing  capabilities.  We  have developed product software designs that we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include IoT solutions do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, and diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\n\n34\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

The  U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency decided in June 2020 not to regulate perchlorate in drinking water at the federal level, although this decision has been challenged, and is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.\n\nIf substantially lower standards are adopted for perchlorate (in California) or for hexavalent chromium (in California or at the federal level), we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the U.S. Government. The amount  that  would  be  allocable  to  our  non-U.S.  Government  contracts  or  that  is  determined  not  to  be  recoverable  under  U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.\n\nWe also are evaluating the potential impact of existing and contemplated legal requirements addressing a class of chemicals known generally as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS have been used ubiquitously, such as in fire-fighting foams, manufacturing  processes,  and  stain-  and  stick-resistant  products  (e.g.,  Teflon,  stain-resistant  fabrics).  Because  we  have  used products  and  processes  over  the  years  containing  some  of  those  compounds,  they  likely  exist  as  contaminants  at  many  of  our environmental remediation sites. Governmental authorities have announced plans, and in some instances have begun, to regulate certain of these compounds at extremely low concentrations in drinking water, which could lead to increased cleanup costs at many of our environmental remediation sites.\n\n## Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Third-Party Guarantees\n\nWe have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly  issued  guarantees  to  third  parties  primarily  relating  to  advances  received  from  customers  and  the  guarantee  of  future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. We had total outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees aggregating $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Third-party guarantees do not include guarantees issued on behalf of subsidiaries and other consolidated entities.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, third-party guarantees totaled $838 million and $871 million, of which approximately 69% and  71%  related  to  guarantees  of  contractual  performance  of  joint  ventures  to  which  we  currently  are  or  previously  were  a party.  These  amounts  represent  our  estimate  of  the  maximum  amounts  we  would  expect  to  incur  upon  the  contractual  nonperformance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\n\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $46 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related and coal mine dust claims. This accrual represents the Company's best estimate of Aearo's probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against Aearo approaching the year 2050. The accrual reflects the Company's assessment of pending and expected lawsuits, its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, and the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the 'Payor Group'). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the 'AO Safety' brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff.\n\nAearo's share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo's potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\n\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo's share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.\n\nBecause of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo's liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo's liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\n\n## Environmental Matters and Litigation\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private parties in the United States and abroad. These laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.\n\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. The Company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability. Please refer to the section entitled ' Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables' that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.",

      "answer": "Boeing accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, using the best estimate or the low end of a range, without discounting due to uncertain timing. Caterpillar discloses that it accrues remediation costs based on site-specific assessments, typically using the minimum estimate when no single amount is more likely, and notes that its total accrued amount is not material and included in Accrued Expenses. Union Pacific reports 376 sites of potential liability, including 28 federal sites (18 on the Superfund National Priorities List), and acknowledges the risk of joint and several liability, which could significantly expand its remediation exposure beyond its own activities. Together, these approaches reflect differing scales and regulatory contexts: Boeing emphasizes uncertainty in timing and third-party recovery, Caterpillar minimizes materiality despite active remediation, and Union Pacific faces broader systemic liability due to transportation infrastructure and legacy contamination.",

We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee's annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of the service cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and  reflected  in  inventory  at  the  end  of  a  reporting  period.  Actuarial  gains  and  losses,  which  occur  when  actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders' equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, we amortize them over the average expected future  lifetime  of  participants.  The  funded  status  of  our  pension  and  postretirement  plans  is  reflected  on  the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## Postemployment Plans\n\nWe record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.\n\n## Environmental Remediation\n\nWe are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,  obligations  and  commitments  for  remediation  of  contaminated  sites, including  assessments  of  ranges  and  probabilities  of  recoveries  from  other  responsible  parties  and/or  insurance carriers.  Our  policy  is  to  accrue  and  charge  to  current  expense  identified  exposures  related  to  environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value  as  the  timing  of  payments  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated.  We  may  be  able  to  recover  a  portion  of  the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $47 and $74 at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe",

Environmental and legal matters\n\nThe Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing its use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal  combustion  engines.  We  have  made,  and  will  continue  to  make,  significant  research  and  development  and  capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.\n\nWe are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When  it  is  probable  we  will  pay  remedial  costs  at  a  site,  and  those  costs  can  be  reasonably  estimated,  we  accrue  the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs against our earnings. We accrue costs based on consideration of  currently  available  data  and  information  with  respect  to  each  individual  site,  including  available  technologies,  current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance  companies  or  others.  We  reassess  these  accrued  amounts  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  amount  recorded  for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.\n\nOn  January  27,  2020,  the  Brazilian  Federal  Environmental Agency  ('IBAMA')  issued  Caterpillar  Brasil  Ltda  a  notice  of violation  regarding  allegations  around  the  requirements  for  use  of  imported  oils  at  the  Piracicaba,  Brazil  facility.  We  have instituted processes to address the allegations. While we are still discussing resolution of these allegations with IBAMA, the initial notice from IBAMA included a proposed fine of approximately $300,000.  We do not expect this fine or our response to address the allegations to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nProperty, Plant and E quipment (PPE ) and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. These software amounts are reported as a component of machinery and equipment within PPE. Depreciation of PPE generally is computed using the straight-line method. Refer to Note 8 for depreciable life and additional details on PPE. Internal-use software elements of PPE are depreciated over a period of three to seven years. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of PPE and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.\n\nDefinite lived intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. These assets are amortized on a on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight-line) that is representative of the asset's use. Refer to Note 5 for amortizable life and additional details on intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are ex pensed as incurred, within 'Research, development and related expenses'.\n\nFully depreciated PPE other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in PPE and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. Definite-lived intangible assets are removed from their respective gross asset and accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use.\n\nPPE and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset's (asset group's) carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nConditional Asset Retirement Obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $195 million and $181 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 3M cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of certain conditional asset retirement obligations based on the nature of particular conditions and outcome of commercial activity.\n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (namely certain tradenames), are not amortized and are assessed for impairment annually (fourth quarter and third quarter, respectively) and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level, which at 3M, primarily corresponds to a division. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples or, in some cases, based on a discounted cash flow analysis. An impairment loss is recognized for an indefinite-lived intangible asset when its fair value (generally determined on a discounted cash flow basis) is less than its carrying value.\n\nRestructuring Actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees in certain circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees' remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company.\n\nRevenue (Sales) Recognition: The Company sells products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3M's customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods.\n\nRevenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Company's customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfer to the customer.",

      "question": "How do Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM), and UPS each manage their liquidity in relation to commercial paper outstanding, and what does this reveal about their short-term financing strategies?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar (CAT) had $3,946 million of commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2024, which is deducted from its total available credit lines of $14,562 million, leaving $9,929 million in available credit. 3M (MMM) had no commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2024, down from $1.8 billion in 2023, indicating a reduction in short-term borrowing. UPS had no commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2024, despite having the capacity to issue up to $10.0 billion in the U.S. and \u20ac5.0 billion in Europe. This suggests that CAT maintains a moderate reliance on commercial paper as part of its liquidity strategy, MMM has significantly reduced its use of short-term paper likely in response to debt restructuring and litigation-related outflows, and UPS maintains a conservative stance by not utilizing commercial paper despite having significant capacity, preferring longer-term debt instruments.",

        "Hop 1: CAT \u2192 Commercial Paper Outstanding: CAT discloses $3,946 million in commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2024, impacting its available credit capacity.",
        "Hop 2: MMM \u2192 Commercial Paper Outstanding: MMM reports a decrease in commercial paper outstanding from $1.8 billion in 2023 to zero in 2024, reflecting a strategic shift in short-term financing.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWorking capital increased $3.5 billion compared with December 31, 2023 primarily driven by lower balances of current liabilities principally of discontinued operations, short-term borrowings and current portions of long-term debt, and current liabilities relating to the PWS settlement (discussed in Note 19).\n\nCash Flows: Discussions of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the sections that follow. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include the results of continuing and discontinued operations and, therefore, also include cash and cash equivalents associated with Solventum through its April 2024 separation from 3M that were presented in current assets of discontinued operations in the 3M Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities:\n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as working capital movements, tax timing differences and other items such as litigation payments can significantly impact cash flows.\n\nIn 2024, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $4.9 billion compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by approximately $4.6 billion in payments associated with PFAS-related other environmental liabilities and the CAE legal settlement (both discussed in Note 19). The 2023 pre-tax charges of $10.5 billion related to the PWS Settlement and of $4.3 billion (inclusive of imputed interest) related to the CAE Settlement largely impacted the net income component within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, with offsets in the other-net and deferred tax elements.\n\n## Cash Flows from Investing Activities:\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E) enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. 3M invested $1.2 billion on PP&amp;E in 2024. The Company expects 2025 capital spending to be approximately $1.1 billion as 3M continues to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability.\n\n3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.\n\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Note 13 for more details about 3M's diversified marketable securities portfolio.\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\n\n## 2024 Debt Activity :\n\nDebt cash flow activity includes proceeds from Solventum's issuance of $8.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt in the first quarter of 2024 partially offset by $2.9 billion in debt maturities, consisting of $1.1 billion of medium-term notes and $1.8 billion repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Gross commercial paper issuances and repayments, in addition to repayments of the fixed-rate notes, are largely reflected in 'Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days)' and \"Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days)\". The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.8 billion commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023. 3M's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 14 for more detail regarding debt.\n\n## 2023 Debt Activity:\n\nDebt cash flow activity included maturities of $1.8 billion of fix ed-rate notes offset by net issuances of commercial paper of $1.8 billion (issuance and subsequent repayments/reissuances). The gross commercial paper issuances and repayments, in addition to repayments of the fixed-rate notes, are largely reflected in 'Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days)' and \"Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days)\".\n\n## Repurchases of Common Stock:\n\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company's stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2024, the Company purchased $1.8 billion of its own stock. For more information, refer to the table titled 'Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities' in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company's stock.\n\n## Dividends Paid to Shareholders:\n\n3M has paid dividends since 1916. Cash dividends declared and paid totaled $1.51 per share for the first quarter of 2024; $0.70 per share for each of the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2024; and $1.50 per share for each quarter in 2023. In February 2025, 3M's Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2025 dividend of $0.73 per share, an increase of 4 percent.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Commercial Paper\n\nWe are authorized to borrow up to $10.0 billion under a U.S. commercial paper program and \u20ac5.0 billion (in a variety of currencies) under a European commercial paper program. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The amount of commercial paper outstanding under these programs in 2025 is expected to fluctuate.\n\n## Debt Classification\n\nWe have classified certain floating-rate senior notes that are redeemable at the option of the note holder as long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets, due to our intent and ability to refinance the debt if the put option is ex ercised.\n\n## Debt Repayments\n\nOn May 21, 2024, our 2.125% Canadian Dollar senior notes with a principal balance of C$750 million ($550 million) matured and were repaid in full.\n\n- On September 3, 2024, our 2.200% senior notes with a principal balance of $400 million matured and were repaid in full.\n- On November 11, 2024, our 2.800% senior notes with a principal balance of $500 million matured and were repaid in full.\n\n## Debt Issuances\n\nOn May 22, 2024 we issued three series of notes in the principal amounts of $900 million, $1.1 billion and $600 million. These notes bear interest at 5.150%, 5.500% and 5.600%, respectively, and mature on May 22, 2034, May 22, 2054 and May 22, 2064, respectively. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. Each series of notes is callable at our option at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount, or the sum of the present values of scheduled payments of principal and interest, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nOn May 28, 2024 we issued floating rate senior notes with a principal balance of $213 million. These notes bear interest at a rate equal to the compounded Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") less 0.350% per year and mature on June 1, 2074. Interest on the notes is payable quarterly. These notes are callable at various times after 30 years at a stated percentage of par value and are redeemable at the option of the note holders at various times after one year at a stated percentage of par value.\n\n## Fixed-Rate Senior Notes\n\nOur fixed-rate notes pay interest semi-annually and allow for redemption by us at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a \"make-whole\" amount, plus accrued interest.\n\n## Reference Rate Reform\n\nOur floating-rate senior notes that mature between 2049 and 2067 initially bore interest at rates that referenced the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") for U.S. Dollars. As part of a broader program of reference rate reform, U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates ceased to be published after June 2023. Beginning July 1, 2023, we transitioned these notes to an alternative reference rate, SOFR, which was adopted in accordance with recommendations of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee .\n\n## Floating-Rate Senior Notes\n\nWe had floating-rate senior notes in the principal amount of $500 million that matured in 2023. These notes bore interest at three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 45 basis points. The average interest rate on these notes for 2023 was 5.32%.\n\nOur outstanding floating-rate senior notes with principal amounts totaling $1.8 billion bear interest at either thirty-day, ninety-day or compounded SOFR, less a spread ranging from 4 to 35 basis points. These notes have maturities ranging from 2049 through 2074. Interest is payable monthly for notes maturing through 2053 and quarterly for notes maturing from 2064 through 2074.\n\nThe average interest rate on the outstanding floating-rate senior notes for 2024 and 2023 was 4.77% and 4.75%, respectively. These notes are callable at various times after 30 years at a stated percentage of par value, and redeemable at the option of the note holders at various times after one year at a stated percentage of par value. We have classified these floating-rate senior notes as long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, due to our intent and ability to refinance the debt if the put option is ex ercised.",

      "answer": "FedEx (FDX) provides detailed assumptions used in valuing stock options, including maximum terms of 10 years, volatility calculations based on historical stock price changes, and risk-free interest rates tied to U.S. Treasury Strips. Honeywell (HON) summarizes stock option activity with a focus on outstanding and exercisable options as of December 31, 2023, indicating structured reporting of equity compensation. UPS includes stock options in its diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculation, showing no dilutive effect from stock options in 2023, compared to 1 million shares in 2022, suggesting a more conservative or reduced use of stock options in recent years.

It also includes deferred rent, lease pre-payments, and initial direct costs in the ROU asset calculation. GE similarly records ROU assets and includes lease and non-lease components in determining the lease liability, except for vehicle leases, and tests ROU assets for impairment when events warrant. 3M, on the other hand, discloses the right-of-use asset as a deferred tax liability, showing a balance of $194 million in 2023, down from $210 million in 2022.

      "answer": "3M projects a declining amortization expense trend, with $453 million in 2024 decreasing from $482 million in 2023, indicating a slowdown in new intangible asset investments or maturing assets. Raytheon Technologies reports a high and relatively stable amortization expense of $2,085 million in 2023, with expectations for similar levels in the near future, suggesting sustained investment in intangible assets. UPS shows a clear downward trend starting from $597 million in 2023, projecting $685 million for 2024 and declining to $306 million by 2028, pointing to a front-loaded amortization schedule likely tied to recent acquisitions. Collectively, these trends highlight differing capital allocation strategies: 3M and UPS show signs of asset maturity or reduced acquisition activity, while RTX maintains high amortization levels, signaling ongoing investment intensity.",

      "question": "How do CAT, GE, and MMM each incorporate the expected return on assets in their pension plan assumptions, and what does this reveal about their respective financial strategies and risk management approaches in 2024?",
      "answer": "CAT increased its expected return on assets for its U.S. pension plans to 6.3% in 2025 from 5.7% in 2024, reflecting a strategic adjustment in asset allocation despite a lower asset base. GE, while not disclosing specific return figures, emphasizes that expected return on assets is a key actuarial assumption in pension calculations, indicating a focus on long-term stability and alignment with discount rates. MMM reported a high expected return on assets of 7.63% for its U.S. pension plans in 2024, up from 7.50% in 2023, suggesting a more aggressive asset growth strategy compared to CAT and GE. Collectively, these approaches reveal differing risk tolerances and financial planning philosophies across the three industrials firms.",

This ex pected decrease is primarily due to lower interest cost in 2025 as a result of higher discount rates at the end of 2024 creating a lower obligation base (U.S. pension plans year-end 2024 obligation was $12.2 billion compared to a year-end 2023 obligation of $13.1 billion) and a higher expected return on assets in 2025 (U.S. pension plans expected rate of return on plans assets is 6.3 percent for 2025 compared to 5.7 percent for 2024; however, this increase is muted due to a lower asset base at year-end 2024 of $11.9 billion compared to $12.7 billion at year-end 2023).\n- Decrease in expense in 2024 compared to 2023 Primarily due to higher mark-to-market gains in 2024 compared to 2023, lower interest cost in 2024 as a result of lower discount rates at year-end 2023 and a higher expected return on plan assets due to a higher asset base at year-end 2023 compared to year-end 2022.\n- Increase in expense in 2023 compared to 2022 Primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains in 2023 compared to 2022 and higher interest cost in 2023 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2022.\n\nThe primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses (gains) for 2024, 2023 and 2022 are described below. We include the net mark-to-market losses (gains) in Other income (expense) in the Results of Operations.\n\n- 2024 net mark-to-market gain of $154 million - Primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2024 compared to the end of 2023. This was partially offset by a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 0.7 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.7 percent).\n- 2023 net mark-to-market gain of $97 million - Primarily due to higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 10.4 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.8 percent) and favorable claims experience related to our other postretirement benefit plans. This was partially offset by lower discount rates at the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022.\n- 2022 net mark-to-market gain of $606 million - Primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2022 compared to the end of 2021. This was partially offset by a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual loss rate of (22.6) percent compared to an expected rate of return of 4.0 percent).",

Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including a discount rate, a compensation assumption, an expected return on assets, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement.\n\nProjected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected benefit payments. We discount those cash payments using a discount rate. We determine the discount rate using the weighted-average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits. Lower discount rates increase present values and generally increase subsequent-year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and generally reduce subsequent-year pension expense.\n\nThe compensation assumption is used to estimate the annual rate at which pay of plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase, as will the amount recorded in A OCI in our Statement of Financial Position and amortized into earnings in subsequent periods.",

      "answer": "Boeing reports a BCA total backlog of $440,507 million at the end of 2023, which increased from the prior year, but notes risks such as customer-controlled contingencies, geopolitical events, and potential cancellations\u2014particularly for 737 and 777X aircraft\u2014that could reduce backlog. General Dynamics highlights specific backlog components such as $1.1 billion in firm backlog for Abrams SEPv3 tanks for Poland and a Combat Systems segment backlog valued through awarded contracts and estimated potential values like $28 billion. Raytheon Technologies reports a significantly larger total backlog of $196 billion as of December 31, 2023, emphasizing its role as a key performance metric and noting that backlog includes only firm orders, excluding unexercised options and potential orders under IDIQ contracts. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies rely on backlog as a forward-looking indicator, Boeing is more exposed to external risks affecting backlog stability, General Dynamics focuses on specific contract milestones and international defense partnerships, and Raytheon maintains a broader, more diversified backlog with a strong emphasis on contract execution and financial discipline.",

      "question": "How have Emerson (EMR), General Dynamics (GD), and UPS each utilized their cash flows for common stock repurchases in 2024, and what does this reveal about their respective capital allocation strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Emerson (EMR) spent $435 million on purchases of common stock, reflecting a reduction compared to the prior year. General Dynamics (GD) allocated $1,501 million toward repurchasing its common stock, indicating a significant increase in buyback activity. UPS spent $500 million on common stock purchases in 2024, continuing its trend of consistent but declining buyback levels over recent years. These figures suggest that while all three companies are returning capital to shareholders through buybacks, GD is the most aggressive in this regard, whereas EMR and UPS have moderated their repurchase activity, potentially signaling different priorities in capital deployment.",

      "question": "How do Honeywell (HON), Lockheed Martin (LMT), and Raytheon (RTX) each quantify or characterize their exposure to environmental liabilities, and what does this reveal about their respective risk management strategies and financial preparedness for environmental remediation obligations?",
      "answer": "Honeywell (HON) quantifies its environmental liabilities as $222 million as of December 31, 2023, with estimated 2024 payments at $227 million, reflecting a structured accrual and payment schedule tied to ongoing litigation, regulatory approvals, and remediation efforts. Lockheed Martin (LMT) discusses environmental liabilities in terms of accounting estimates, noting that these liabilities and associated assets for probable recovery are evaluated using significant assumptions and judgments, indicating a more qualitative and internally assessed approach. Raytheon (RTX) acknowledges environmental liabilities in the context of legal proceedings and contingent obligations, noting that while it cannot predict outcomes, it does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, suggesting a more risk-tolerant or defensively positioned posture. Together, these disclosures show that HON provides the most transparent and detailed financial exposure, LMT emphasizes internal estimation rigor, and RTX downplays material impact, reflecting varied strategic approaches to environmental risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: HON \u2192 Environmental Liabilities: HON discloses specific accruals ($222M in 2023) and payment estimates ($227M in 2024), showing detailed financial exposure tied to environmental remediation and litigation.",
        "Hop 2: LMT \u2192 Environmental Liabilities: LMT discusses environmental liabilities as part of significant accounting estimates, indicating that they are evaluated internally with assumptions about recovery and timing, but without specific dollar figures or timelines.",
        "Hop 3: RTX \u2192 Environmental Liabilities: RTX references environmental liabilities in the context of legal proceedings and contingent risks, asserting that these matters are not expected to have a material adverse impact, without quantifying exposure."

FDX discusses expected return on assets (EROA) as a key assumption in pension accounting and notes that EROA is a judgmental estimate reviewed annually, though it does not quantify a specific change. UNP provides a sensitivity analysis showing that a 0.25% decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by $12 million. Together, these disclosures reveal varying degrees of explicit quantification and sensitivity to asset performance assumptions: CAT provides forward-looking estimates of EROA impact, FDX emphasizes the judgmental nature of EROA without quantifying it, and UNP offers a direct sensitivity metric showing the financial impact of EROA changes.",

This ex pected decrease is primarily due to lower interest cost in 2025 as a result of higher discount rates at the end of 2024 creating a lower obligation base (U.S. pension plans year-end 2024 obligation was $12.2 billion compared to a year-end 2023 obligation of $13.1 billion) and a higher expected return on assets in 2025 (U.S. pension plans expected rate of return on plans assets is 6.3 percent for 2025 compared to 5.7 percent for 2024; however, this increase is muted due to a lower asset base at year-end 2024 of $11.9 billion compared to $12.7 billion at year-end 2023).\n- Decrease in expense in 2024 compared to 2023 Primarily due to higher mark-to-market gains in 2024 compared to 2023, lower interest cost in 2024 as a result of lower discount rates at year-end 2023 and a higher expected return on plan assets due to a higher asset base at year-end 2023 compared to year-end 2022.\n- Increase in expense in 2023 compared to 2022 Primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains in 2023 compared to 2022 and higher interest cost in 2023 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2022.\n\nThe primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses (gains) for 2024, 2023 and 2022 are described below. We include the net mark-to-market losses (gains) in Other income (expense) in the Results of Operations.\n\n- 2024 net mark-to-market gain of $154 million - Primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2024 compared to the end of 2023. This was partially offset by a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 0.7 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.7 percent).\n- 2023 net mark-to-market gain of $97 million - Primarily due to higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 10.4 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.8 percent) and favorable claims experience related to our other postretirement benefit plans. This was partially offset by lower discount rates at the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022.\n- 2022 net mark-to-market gain of $606 million - Primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2022 compared to the end of 2021. This was partially offset by a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual loss rate of (22.6) percent compared to an expected rate of return of 4.0 percent).",

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets that are to be held and used, an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment ex ists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value.\n\nWe operate integrated transportation networks so cash flows for most of our operating assets to be held and used are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level, for our analysis of impairment.\n\nIn 2024, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft and seven related engines to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $157 million ($120 million, net of tax , or $0.48 per diluted share) was recorded in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines for the same reasons stated above. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax , or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in 2023.\n\nIn the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. Temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. These temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. The criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion activities. At May 31, 2024, we had 19 aircraft temporarily idled. These aircraft have been idled for an average of eight months and are expected to return to revenue service.\n\nGOODWILL. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the ex pected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we proceed to test goodwill for impairment, including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value for our reporting units is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. Fair value determinations may include both internal and third-party valuations. Unless circumstances otherwise dictate, we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter. See Note 4 for additional information.\n\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS . Intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, technology assets, and trademarks acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from 1 to 15 years, either on a straight-line basis or on a basis consistent with the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized. See Note 4 for additional information.\n\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS. Our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management's assumptions for discount rate, investment returns on plan assets, salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation ('PBO') could be effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds (rated Aa or better) with cash flows that are designed to match our expected benefit payments in future years. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets ('EROA') for interim and segment reporting purposes. Our EROA is a judgmental estimate which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised as appropriate.\n\nThe accounting guidance related to employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of these plans. We use 'mark-to-market' (or 'MTM') accounting and immediately recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial gains or losses in our results annually in the fourth quarter each year. The annual MTM adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and does not impact segment results. The remaining",

For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair v alue net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair v alue at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. T he expense is recognized ov er the requisite serv ice period, which is generally the v esting period of the award.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nProvisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Loss before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulativ e effect of any changes in tax rates from those used prev iously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such prov isions differ from the amounts currently receiv able or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax prov isions and evaluating tax positions.\n\nThe accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. T o the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. T ax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax benefit/(expense).\n\nWe also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recov er our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a v aluation allowance if, based on the av ailable ev idence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.  Changes in our estimates and judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets may result in an increase or decrease to our tax expense and/or other comprehensiv e income, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.\n\n## Postretirement Plans\n\nMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. The majority of employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans hav e transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement sav ings plan. We also prov ide postretirement benefit plans other than  pensions,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  cov erage  to  eligible  retirees  and  qualifying  dependents.  Benefits  under  the  pension  and  other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of serv ice and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee's annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return and medical trend (rate of growth  for  medical  costs).  Actuarial  gains  and  losses,  which  occur  when  actual  experience  differs  from  actuarial  assumptions,  are  reflected  in Shareholders' equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, we amortize them over the av erage expected future lifetime of participants.  T he funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the  Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## Postemployment Plans\n\nWe record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as sev erance or job training, when payment is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.",

For example, we tested the internal controls over management's review of the defined benefit pension obligation calculations, the significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided to the actuaries. To test the defined benefit pension obligation, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating  the  methodology  used,  the  significant  actuarial  assumptions  described  above  and  the  underlying  data  used  by  the Corporation.  We  compared  the  actuarial  assumptions  used  by  management  to  historical  trends  and  evaluated  the  change  in  the defined benefit pension obligation from prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, benefit payments, settlements, actuarial gains and losses, longevity assumptions and plan amendments. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating  management's  methodology  for  determining  the  discount  rate  that  considers  the  maturity  and  duration  of  the  benefit payments and is used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to the prior year and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. Lastly, we also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to the Corporation's actuarial specialists.\n\n## /s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1994.\n\nTysons, Virginia January 28, 2025",

The annual measurement date is December 31. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fix ed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. Changes in expected benefit payment and service cost cash flows, as well as ongoing changes in market activity and yields, cause these rates to be subject to uncertainty.\n\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n\n",

      "answer": "CAT reported a 64% increase in consolidated operating profit to $12,966 million in 2023, driven by strong performance across all major segments, particularly Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries, which saw increases of 49% and 47%, respectively. LMT attributed its consolidated operating profit to adjustments related to the FAS/CAS pension operating difference and unallocated corporate costs, indicating a more complex cost structure influenced by government contracting standards and pension accounting. UPS, in contrast, reported a decline in consolidated operating profit to $9,141 million in 2023 from $13,094 million in 2022, primarily due to reduced performance in its U.S. Domestic Package and International Package segments. When combined, these perspectives reveal that while CAT benefited from strong industrial demand, LMT's profitability was shaped by accounting adjustments and regulatory factors, and UPS faced headwinds from reduced shipping volumes and supply chain normalization, highlighting divergent performance drivers across the industrials sector.",

      "answer": "FedEx reports that changes in discount rates significantly affect the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans, with actuarial gains and losses recognized through MTM accounting. General Dynamics highlights that a 25-basis-point change in the discount rate would impact its pension obligation by approximately $261 million (decrease) or $272 million (increase), showing a high sensitivity to interest rate assumptions. UPS quantifies the effect of discount rate changes more directly, noting a $2.8 billion pre-tax actuarial gain in 2024 due to an increase in the weighted-average discount rate from 5.40% to 5.85%, primarily driven by higher treasury yields on AA-rated corporate bonds. Together, these disclosures illustrate that all three companies experience material impacts from discount rate fluctuations, but UPS provides the most granular view of how rising rates reduce pension liabilities, while FedEx focuses on accounting treatment and General Dynamics offers a narrower sensitivity range.",

W e  use  both  qualitative  and quantitative  approaches  when  testing  goodwill  for  im pairm ent.  When  determ ining  the  approach  to  be  used,  we  consider  the  current  facts  and circumstances of each reporting unit as well as the excess of each reporting unit's estim ated fair value over its carrying value based on our m ost recent quantitative assessm ents. Our qualitative approach evaluates the business environm ent and various events im pacting the reporting unit including, but not  l i m i ted  to,  m acroeconom i c  condi ti ons,  changes  i n  the  busi ness  envi ronm ent  and  reporti ng  uni t-speci fi c  events.  If ,  based  on  the  qual i tati ve assessment, we determine that it is m ore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, then a quantitative assessment is not necessary . However, if a quantitative assessm ent is determ ined to be necessary , we com pare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and, if necessary, recognize an im pairm ent loss for the am ount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\n\nOur estimate of a reporting unit's fair value is based prim arily on the discounted cash flows of the underlying operations and requires the use of judgment by management. The process requires num erous assum ptions, including the tim ing of work em bedded in our backlog, our perform ance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows, and term inal-value growth rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows. Due to the variables inherent in our estim ates of fair value, differences in assum ptions m ay have a m aterial effect on the result of our im pairm ent analysis. T o assess the reasonableness of our discounted cash flows, we compare the sum  of our reporting units' fair value to our m arket capitalization. Additionally , we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit's fair value by com paring the fair value to peer com panies and recent relevant m arket transactions.\n\nIn  the  f ourth  quarter  of  2024,  we  com pleted  qualitative  assessm ents  for  each  of  our  reporting  units.  Our Aerospace,  Marine  System s  and Combat Systems reporting units' estim ated fair values significantly exceeded their respective carrying values based on our m ost recent quantitative assessments, which were perform ed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our T echnologies reporting unit's estim ated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25% at the tim e of our last quantitative assessm ent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our qualitative assessm ents this year did not present indicators of im pairm ent.\n\nCommitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from  the norm al course of business or under  provisions  relating  to  the  protection  of  the  environm ent.  Estim ating  liabilities  and  costs  associated  with  these  m atters  requires  the  use  of judgment. We record a liability associated with claim s or pending or threatened litigation when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the am ount i s  reasonably estim able.  The ultim ate resolution of our exposure related to these m atters m ay change as further facts and circum stances becom e known.\n\nRetirement Plans. Our pension and other post-retirem ent benefit costs and obligations depend on several assum ptions and estim ates, which are based on our best judgm ent, including consideration of current and future m arket conditions. For a discussion of our assum ptions and any changes to these assumptions, as well as the im pact of these changes, which is reported as an actuarial gain or loss in the reconciliation of the change in the benefit obligation, see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statem ents in Item  8. The key assum ption is the interest rates used to discount estim ated future pension benefits. W e base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from  a portfolio of high-quality , fixed-incom e investm ents with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period. The effect of a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in the discount rate assum ption on the December 31, 2024, pension benefit obligation is ($261) or $272, respectively.",

The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higheryielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term capital growth to meet future obligations while minimizing risk ex posures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by our investment committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments, U.S. government securities, derivatives and other instruments. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fix ed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; hedge funds, equity securities and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund; and derivatives and other instruments primarily valued using pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign currency exchange rates and investment forward price. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.",

      "answer": "Boeing accounts for warranty costs by estimating the number of months of warranty coverage remaining for delivered products and historical monthly warranty payments, with additional accruals for major warranty issues. Caterpillar develops specific warranty rates per product shipment month and updates them monthly based on actual claim experience, with a $1.4 billion reserve for product liability and insurance losses at the end of 2023. Lockheed Martin records estimated warranty costs at product delivery based on remaining warranty coverage and historical payments, with warranty obligations on long-term contracts included in estimates at completion.

This indicates a cost of sales to net sales ratio of approximately 67.7% in 2022 and 63.3% in 2023, suggesting improved cost efficiency over the period. LMT reported a total cost of sales of $64,113 million in 2024, representing 92.5% of product sales, which indicates a high cost-to-revenue ratio and limited flexibility in cost control. RTX noted an organic increase in total cost of sales of $6.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher net sales at its major divisions, suggesting a direct correlation between revenue growth and cost increases. Among the three, EMR demonstrated the most significant improvement in cost control relative to revenue changes, while LMT's high cost ratio and RTX's cost increases tied to revenue growth suggest less effective cost management strategies.",

      "answer": "Boeing reports segment revenues of $19.954 billion in 2024, split between Commercial ($11.736 billion) and Government ($7.832 billion) segments, showing a growing emphasis on commercial aviation. FedEx organizes its business into service-based segments (FedEx Express, Ground, Freight, and Services), with segment reporting focused on operational service lines rather than geographic or customer-type splits. Honeywell restructured its segments in 2024 to reflect a global operational strategy, now reporting under four segments: Aerospace Technologies, Industrial Automation, Building Automation, and Energy and Sustainability Solutions. This indicates a strategic pivot toward technology-driven diversification. Together, these reveal Boeing focusing on customer-type segmentation with growth in commercial markets, FedEx maintaining service-line clarity for logistics optimization, and Honeywell realigning for a more globally integrated, tech-forward portfolio.",

RTX discusses the impact of foreign exchange on its financial statements, noting that foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at balance sheet dates, with translation effects deferred as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL). UPS mentions that $1.9 billion of its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held by foreign subsidiaries and states that these funds are generally available for distribution to the U.S. without U.S. federal income taxes, though they may be subject to foreign withholding and U.S. state taxes.

COMPANY-SPONSORED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nWe sponsor various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit and defined contribution plans which cover our employees worldwide.\n\n## U.S. Pension Benefits\n\nIn the U.S. we maintain the following single-employer defined benefit pension plans: the UPS Retirement Plan, the UPS Pension Plan, the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan, a non-qualified plan.\n\nThe UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and includes substantially all eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries hired prior to July 1, 2016 who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a tax-qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS').\n\nThe UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n\nThe UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes employees that were previously members of the Central States Pension Fund (\"CSPF\"), a multiemployer pension plan, in addition to other eligible employees who are covered under certain collective bargaining agreements. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n\nThe UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS Retirement Plan, hired prior to July 1, 2016, for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above.\n\nThe UPS Retirement Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan will cease accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, certain former U.S. employees were offered the option to receive a one-time payment of their vested pension benefit. Approximately 18,800 former employees accepted this option, accelerating $820 million in benefit payments during 2019 while reducing the number of participants who are due future payments from U.S. pension plans. As the cost of these settlements did not exceed the plans' service cost and interest cost for the year, the impact of the settlement was not recognized in earnings.\n\nOn April 30, 2021, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight as discussed in note 4. The divestiture triggered an interim remeasurement of certain UPS-sponsored pension and postretirement medical benefit plans under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715- Compensation- Retirement Benefits ('ASC 715'). Accordingly, we remeasured the plan assets and benefit obligations of the UPS Pension Plan, UPS Retirement Plan and UPS Retired Employee Health Care Plan as of April 30, 2021.\n\nThe interim remeasurement resulted in an actuarial gain of $2.1 billion. The actuarial gain reflects a $3.7 billion benefit from a 49 basis point increase in the discount rate compared to December 31, 2020 and a $0.1 billion benefit related to workforce reductions associated with the divestiture, offset by a $1.7 billion loss resulting from actual returns being approximately 430 basis points below expected returns. The $2.1 billion actuarial gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. A pre-tax actuarial gain of $69 million ($52 million after tax) was immediately recognized for a prior service credit related to the divested group in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter. We also amended certain benefit terms within these plans as of April 30, 2021. The amendment to the UPS Pension Plan resulted in the immediate recognition of a $66 million ($50 million after tax) loss in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter.\n\nThe impacts of the plan remeasurements and plan amendments are included within Other expenses in the statements of consolidated income as components of the divestiture of UPS Freight.",

      "question": "How do Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), and FedEx (FDX) each reflect the impact of U.S. state deferred taxes in their financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about the relative volatility and significance of state-level tax adjustments to their overall tax expense?",
      "answer": "Boeing reported U.S. state deferred tax expenses of $19 million in 2023, following $54 million in 2022 and $24 million in 2021, showing a declining trend. Caterpillar reported U.S. state deferred tax expenses of -$37 million (a benefit) in 2023, -$23 million in 2022, and -$50 million in 2021, indicating consistent state-level tax benefits over three years. FedEx, in contrast, disclosed a $54 million increase in tax expense due to 'State deferred tax remeasurement' in 2024, with no such item in 2023 or earlier, suggesting a one-time impact from state tax changes.

      "answer": "In 2024, FedEx (FDX) experienced a 3% revenue decline, partly due to volume declines at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight, highlighting a direct sensitivity to shipment volume. General Dynamics (GD), on the other hand, reported a 12.9% revenue increase to $47.7 billion, with volume cited as a key driver in its defense segments, where revenue is recognized based on production or service activity levels. UPS noted that volume could be negatively impacted by high fuel surcharges, which could shift demand from higher-yielding to lower-yielding products or reduce overall volume, affecting profitability. This reveals that while FDX and UPS are directly exposed to volume-driven revenue shifts in logistics and delivery, GD's defense contracts provide a more stable and growing revenue base insulated from typical market volume pressures.",

Revenue at Corporate, other, and eliminations decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower yields and reduced volume at FedEx Logistics, Inc. ('FedEx Logistics'). FedEx Freight revenue decreased 6% in 2024 primarily due to lower shipments, weight per shipment, and fuel surcharges, partially offset by base yield improvement. FedEx Ground revenue increased 2% in 2024 primarily due to base yield improvement and higher volume, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\n\nIn 2024, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft and seven related engines to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $157 million ($120 million, net of tax , or $0.48 per diluted share) was recorded in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines for the same reasons stated above. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax , or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to FedEx Dataworks. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. We also recorded an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax , or $0.03 per diluted share) noncash intangible asset impairment charge related to the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx  Dataworks. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of this MD&amp;A and Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Business Optimization and Realignment Costs\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We have commenced our plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to bring FedEx Ground and FedEx Services into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground express network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight continues to provide LTL freight transportation services as a separate subsidiary. The organizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. These costs were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. The identification of these costs as business optimization-related ex penditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures. We expect the aggregate pre-tax cost of our business optimization activities to be approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. The timing and amount of our business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.",

T ypically , revenue is recognized over tim e using costs incurred to date relative to total estim ated costs at completion to m easure progress toward satisfying our perform ance obligations. Incurred costs represent work perform ed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the custom er. Contract costs include labor, m aterial, overhead and, when appropriate, G&amp;A expenses. V ariances in costs recognized from  period to period reflect prim arily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts. Because costs are used as a m easure of progress, year-over-year variances in costs result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volum e.\n\nOperating earnings and m argin in the defense segm ents are driven by changes in volum e, perform ance or contract m ix. Perform ance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustm ents to estim ates at com pletion on individual contracts. These adjustm ents result from  increases or decreases to  the  esti m ated  val ue  of   the  contract,  the  esti m ated  costs  to  com pl ete  the  contract  or  both.  Therefore,  changes  i n  costs  i ncurred  i n  the  peri od compared with prior periods do not necessarily im pact profitability . It is only when total estim ated costs at com pletion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value (or vice versa) that the profitability of that contract m ay be im pacted. Contract m ix refers to changes in the volum e of higher- versus lower-m argin work. Higher or lower m argins can result from  a num ber of factors, including contract type (e.g., fi xed-pri ce/cost-reim bursable) and type of work (e.g., developm ent/production). Contract m ix can also refer to the stage of program  m aturity for our long-term  production contracts. New long-term  production contracts typically have lower m argins initially , and then m argins generally increase as we achieve learning curve im provem ents or realize other cost reductions.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW\n\n## 2024 IN REVIEW\n\n- Strong operating perform ance:\n- Revenue of $47.7 billion, an increase of 12.9% from  2023\n- Operating earnings of $4.8 billion, an increase of 13% from  2023, with sequential growth throughout the year\n- Diluted earnings per share of $13.63, up 13.4% from  2023\n- Cash provided by operating activities of $4.1 billion, or 109% of net earnings\n- Backlog of $90.6 billion, supporting our long-term  growth expectations:\n- Strong Gulfstream  aircraft order activity, including orders across all aircraft m odels\n- Several significant contract awards received in our defense segm ents, including $3.7 billion of com bined awards from  the U.S. Navy for advance procurement and other work for the Virginia-class subm arine program",

Accordingly, our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate acquired operations, unanticipated performance or other issues or transaction-related charges.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## Changing fuel and energy prices, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities could materially adversely affect us.\n\nFuel and energy costs have a significant impact on our operations. We require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risks associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. We seek to mitigate our ex posure to changing fuel prices through our pricing strategy and have in the past and may in the future utilize hedging transactions. There can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective. If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges, higher fuel costs could materially adversely impact our operating results. Even if we are able to offset changes in fuel costs with surcharges, high fuel surcharges have in the past, and may in the future result in a shift from our higher-yielding products to lower-yielding products or an overall reduction in volume, revenue and profitability. Moreover, we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of new or increased regulation, war or other conflicts, weather-related events or natural disasters, actions by producers (including as part of their own sustainability efforts) or other factors beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe conduct business in a number of countries, with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the United States. Our international operations are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies, in particular the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar.\n\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and that portion of our long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. Additionally, changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related costs recognized in the statements of consolidated income. The impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs, and on our debt, is discussed further in Part I, \"Item 7 - Critical Accounting Estimates,\" and Part II, \"Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\", respectively, of this report.\n\nWe monitor and manage foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures, and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial condition and results of operations; however, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or effectively hedged, and may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Our business requires significant capital and other investments; if we do not accurately forecast our future investment needs, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur business requires significant capital investments, including in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and sortation and other equipment. In addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements, we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to economic and regulatory conditions. These investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth. Forecasting amounts, types and timing of investments involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty and may be beyond our control, such as technological changes, general economic trends, revenues, profitability, changes in governmental regulation and competition. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, we could under- or over-invest, or have excess capacity or insufficient capacity, any of which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability.",

      "question": "How do Boeing (BA), General Electric (GE), and 3M (MMM) differ in their execution of share repurchase programs during 2023, and what does this indicate about their respective capital deployment priorities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing (BA) did not execute any open-market share repurchases under its repurchase program, although it received 1,448,228 shares from employees related to tax withholding on restricted stock units. General Electric (GE) actively repurchased 2,168,000 shares under its repurchase authorization at an average price of $116.53 per share, with $938 million remaining available under the program at year-end. 3M (MMM) repurchased $33 million worth of shares during the year, a significant decrease from $1.5 billion in 2022, leaving approximately $4.2 billion remaining under its $10 billion repurchase authorization. This variation indicates that GE remained committed to returning capital through buybacks despite market conditions, MMM adopted a more conservative approach, possibly prioritizing liquidity or other strategic uses, and BA chose to forgo buybacks entirely, potentially redirecting capital toward other corporate needs or debt management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BA \u2192 Repurchase Program: Boeing explicitly stated that it did not purchase any shares in the open market under a repurchase program during 2023, although it received 1,448,228 shares from employees related to restricted stock unit tax obligations.",
        "Hop 2: GE \u2192 Repurchase Program: GE actively executed share repurchases in Q4 2023, totaling 2,168,000 shares under its repurchase authorization at an average price of $116.53, with $938 million remaining available under the program.",
        "Hop 3: MMM \u2192 Repurchase Program: 3M repurchased only $33 million of its own stock in 2023, a sharp decline from $1.5 billion in 2022, with $4.2 billion still available under its $10 billion repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2023."

RTX highlighted that changes in pension assumptions\u2014particularly discount rate and expected return on plan assets\u2014could materially affect future earnings, equity, and cash contributions, and noted the sensitivity of its financial position to these actuarial estimates.

      "question": "How do FDX, GD, and GE each reflect the role of net earnings in their financial performance and shareholder value creation in 2024, and what does this reveal about their capital allocation strategies?",
      "answer": "FDX reported net earnings allocable to common shares of $4,325 million in 2024, showing an upward trend in earnings per share and indicating strong profitability and shareholder returns through earnings growth. GD's 2024 financial data shows net earnings of $3,782 million, which contributed to retained earnings and supported share repurchases totaling $1,509 million, suggesting a balanced approach to reinvestment and returning value to shareholders. GE, on the other hand, reported that changes in policy benefit reserves resulted in immaterial charges to net earnings in 2024, indicating stable actuarial assumptions and consistent claims experience, which implies a more conservative and risk-controlled impact on earnings and capital management.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Environmental Remediation\n\nWe are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the env ironment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of  contaminated  sites.  We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  rev iews,  our  contingencies,  obligations  and commitments for  remediation  of  contaminated  sites,  including  assessments  of  ranges  and  probabilities  of  recov eries  from  other  responsible  parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to env ironmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for inv estigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present v alue as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recov er a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recov eries are recorded when realization of the claim for recov ery is deemed probable.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negativ e balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negativ e balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $110  and $117 at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInv entoried  costs  on  commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable ov erhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant serv ices, not in excess  of  estimated  net  realizable  v alue.  T o  the  extent  a  material  amount  of  such  costs  are  related  to  an  abnormal  ev ent  or  are  fixed  costs  not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inv entoried. Inv entoried costs include amounts relating  to  programs  and  contracts  with  long-term  production  cycles,  a  portion  of  which  is  not  expected  to  be  realized  within  one  year .  Included  in inv entory for federal gov ernment contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.\n\nCommercial aircraft  programs  inv entory  includes  deferred  production  costs  and  supplier  adv ances.  Deferred  production  costs  represent  actual  costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated av erage cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or deriv ativ e aircraft program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of v olume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully  recov ered  when  all  units  included  in  the  accounting  quantity  are  deliv ered  as  the  expected  unit  cost  for  later  deliv eries  is  below  the  estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier adv ances represent payments for parts we hav e contracted to receiv e from suppliers in the future. As parts are receiv ed, supplier adv ances are amortized to work in process.\n\nThe determination of net realizable v alue of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly rev iews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract rev enues, a loss prov ision is recorded. The determination of net realizable v alue of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program rev iews that estimate rev enue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program rev enues to go, a program loss prov ision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undeliv ered units in the accounting quantity.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs against our earnings.  We  accrue  costs  based  on  consideration  of  currently  available  data  and  information  with  respect  to  each  individual  site,  including  available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.\n\nOur operations in Brazil are subject to highly complex labor, tax, customs and other laws. While we believe that we are in compliance with such laws, we are periodically engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws, including certain tax  and customs disputes with federal, state and municipal authorities in Brazil relating to ex port activities associated with Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential losses; however, we currently believe that any matters raised will not have a material adverse effect on the  Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\nIn addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax es (other than income tax es) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in ex cess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\n## 23. Segment information\n\n## A. Basis for segment information\n\nOur Executive Office is comprised of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), four G roup Presidents, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), a Chief Legal Officer and G eneral Counsel and a Chief Human Resources Officer. The COO, G roup Presidents and CFO are accountable for a related set of end-toend businesses that they manage. The Chief Legal Officer and G eneral Counsel leads the Law, Security and Public Policy Division. The Chief Human Resources Officer leads the Human Resources Organization. The CEO allocates resources and manages performance at the COO/G roup President/CFO level. As such, the CEO serves as our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), and operating segments are primarily based on the COO/Group President/CFO reporting structure.\n\nThree  of  our  operating  segments,  Construction  Industries,  Resource  Industries  and  Energy  &amp;  Transportation  are  led  by  G roup  Presidents. One  operating segment, Financial Products, is led by the CFO who also has responsibility for Corporate Services. Corporate Services is a cost center primarily responsible for the performance of certain support functions globally and to provide centralized services; it does not meet the definition of an operating segment. One G roup President leads one smaller operating segment that is included in the All Other Segment. The Law, Security and Public Policy Division and the Human Resources Organization are cost centers and do not meet the definition of an operating segment.\n\n## B. Description of segments\n\nWe have five operating segments, of which four are reportable segments. Following is a brief description of our reportable segments and the business activities included in the All Other Segment:",

In addition, during the term of the DPAs, the DPAs' transaction-related requirements may impact our ability to execute potential future divestitures within ex pected timeframes or consistent with expected valuation metrics, which could delay or impair our ability to achieve the expected benefits from our strategic plan, or otherwise harm our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWe are subject to litigation, environmental, anti-corruption, and other legal and compliance risks. We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks.  These risks relate to, among other things, product safety and reliability, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, the use of artificial intelligence, ex port control, sanctions, employment matters, securities laws, competition laws, and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). Product recalls and product liability and warranty claims can result in significant damages and costs, including fines, as well as other harm to our business as discussed above. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.\n\nWe use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in certain of our operations. We also rely upon the use of chemical substances that are heavily regulated in connection with our products, manufacturing processes and operation of our facilities. As a result, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to potential non-compliance and both personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers or other illnesses incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties' employees, or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. For example, we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of  properties  and,  in  some  cases,  have  been  named  as  a  defendant  in  related  'tox ic  tort'  claims.  We  are  also  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  that:  (1)  impose requirements for chemical substances and the proper management, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (2) restrict air and water emissions from our operations (including U.S. government-owned facilities we manage); and (3) require maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions, decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, and/or reduce the risks of injury to people. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. A criminal violation of certain U.S. environmental statutes such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act could result in suspension, debarment, or disqualification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A facility determined to be in violation of the criminal provisions of these statutes can be prohibited from performing any U.S. government contract work until the violation has been corrected and the EPA approves the reinstatement of the facility. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. In addition, new laws, regulations, or governmental policies, sudden changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new clean-up standards could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nIn addition, the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to U.S. and non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents. U.S. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are, therefore, subject to the FCPA and other antibribery and anti-corruption laws, including the anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of non-U.S. countries. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and anti-corruption  laws.  Despite  meaningful  measures  that  we  undertake  to  ensure  lawful  conduct,  which  include  training  and  internal  control  policies,  these measures may not always prevent violations of the FCPA or similar laws. As discussed above and as previously disclosed, in October 2024, the Company entered into a DPA with the DOJ and consented to the entry of an SEC Administrative Order to resolve investigations related to conduct that, among other things, violated the FCPA. We have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and could be subject to such",

      "question": "How do Caterpillar (CAT), FedEx (FDX), and Honeywell (HON) compare in their short-term lease cost trends over the past year, and what does this reveal about their respective leasing strategies in 2024?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar reported a short-term lease cost of $65 million in 2024, up slightly from $62 million in 2023. FedEx recorded a significantly higher short-term lease cost of $494 million in 2024, down from $531 million in the prior year. Honeywell, in contrast, had a much smaller short-term lease cost of $2 million in 2024, a notable decline from $13 million in 2023. These differences suggest that FedEx maintains a more extensive short-term leasing strategy, likely tied to its logistics and transportation assets, while Caterpillar shows moderate reliance, and Honeywell appears to be reducing its dependence on short-term leases.",

Pension  costs  are  allocated  to  BDS  and  BGS  businesses  supporting  government  customers  using  U.S. Government  Cost  Accounting  Standards  (CAS),  which  employ  different  actuarial  assumptions  and  accounting conventions than GAAP. These costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated  to  business  segments  based  on  CAS,  which  is  generally  based  on  benefits  paid.  FAS/CAS  service  cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service  costs  calculated  under  GAAP  and  costs  allocated  to  the  business  segments.  Non-operating  pension  and postretirement  expenses  represent  the  components  of  net  periodic  benefit  costs  other  than  service  cost.  These expenses are included in Other income, net.",

      "answer": "GE provides detailed disclosures on postretirement benefit plans in Note 12 of its 2022 10-K, indicating a structured reporting approach. HON reveals that it sponsors both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, with most U.S. retirees having either no subsidy or a fixed-dollar subsidy for retiree medical benefits, limiting exposure to healthcare cost increases. LMT highlights a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion in 2021 due to accelerated recognition of actuarial losses, and reports tax benefits of $3.0 billion at the end of 2021 related to postretirement benefit plans. Together, these show varying degrees of financial impact and strategic management of long-term liabilities, with HON limiting future exposure, LMT experiencing significant one-time charges, and GE maintaining comprehensive disclosure practices.",

Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.\n\nThe Company also sponsors postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the  vast  majority  of  Honeywell's  U.S.  retirees  either  have  no  Company  subsidy  or  have  a  fixed-dollar  subsidy  amount.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\n## Litigation\n\nIn  2015,  Electric  Boat  Corporation,  a  subsidiary  of  General  Dynamics  Corporation,  received  a  Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding an investigation of potential False Claims Act  violations  relating  to  alleged  failures  of  Electric  Boat's  quality  system  with  respect  to  allegedly  nonconforming parts purchased from a supplier. In 2016, Electric Boat was made aware that it is a defendant in a lawsuit related to this matter which had been filed under seal in U.S. district court. Also in 2016, the Suspending and  Debarring  Official  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Navy  issued  a  Show  Cause  Letter  to  Electric  Boat requesting  that  Electric  Boat  respond  to  the  official's  concerns  regarding  Electric  Boat's  oversight  and management  with  respect  to  its  quality  assurance  systems  for  subcontractors  and  suppliers.  Electric  Boat responded to the Show Cause Letter and engaged in discussions with the U.S. government.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Department of Justice declined to intervene in the qui tam action, noting that its investigation continues, and the court unsealed the relator's complaint. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the relator  filed  a  second  amended  complaint.  In  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  the  court  dismissed  the  relator's complaint with prejudice. The relator has appealed the dismissal of the complaint to the United States Court of Appeals.  Given  the  current  status  of  these  matters,  we  are  unable  to  express  a  view  regarding  the  ultimate outcome or, if the outcome is adverse, to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss. Depending on the outcome of these matters, there could be a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nAdditionally,  various  other  claims  and  legal  proceedings  incidental  to  the  normal  course  of  business  are pending or threatened against us. These other matters relate to such issues as government investigations and claims, the protection of the environment, asbestos-related claims and employee-related matters. The nature of litigation  is  such  that  we  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  these  other  matters.  However,  based  on  information currently  available,  we  believe  any  potential  liabilities  in  these  other  proceedings,  individually  or  in  the aggregate, will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Environmental\n\nWe  are  subject  to  and  affected  by  a  variety  of  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  environmental  laws  and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current  and  former  facilities  and  third-party  sites  that  we  do  not  own  but  where  we  have  been  designated  a potentially  responsible  party  (PRP)  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  or  a  state  environmental agency.  Based  on  historical  experience,  we  expect  that  a  significant  percentage  of  the  total  remediation  and compliance  costs  associated  with  these  facilities  will  continue  to  be  allowable  contract  costs  and,  therefore, recoverable under U.S. government contracts.\n\nAs  required,  we  provide  financial  assurance  for  certain  sites  undergoing  or  subject  to  investigation  or remediation.  We  accrue  environmental  costs  when  it  is  probable  that  a  liability  has  been  incurred  and  the amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Where  applicable,  we  seek  insurance  recovery  for  costs  related  to environmental liabilities. We do not record insurance recoveries before collection is considered probable. Based on all known facts and analyses, we do not believe that our liability at any individual site, or in the aggregate, arising from such environmental conditions will be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We also do not believe that the range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond what has been recorded would be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.",

Cash receipts or payments related to the settlement of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded as investing cash flows within the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Cash  Flows.  Additional  information  pertaining  to  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  and  net investment hedging is included in 'Note 15: Financial Instruments.'\n\nEnvironmental . Environmental investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation  of  currently  available  facts  with  respect  to  each  individual  site,  including  existing  technology,  current  laws  and regulations and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. For sites with multiple responsible parties, we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs. Liabilities with fixed or reliably determinable future cash payments are discounted. A portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs, which requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity with the U.S. government.  We  consider  such  recovery  probable  based  on  government  contracting  regulations  and  our  history  of  receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within Other  assets  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  Accrued  environmental  liabilities  are  not  reduced  by  potential  insurance reimbursements  or  potential  recoveries  from  pursuing  other  parties.  We  also  lease  certain  government-owned  properties  and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See 'Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies' for additional details on the environmental remediation activities.\n\nPension and Postretirement Obligations. U.S. GAAP requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) plans. Funded status is measured at least annually in the fourth quarter and represents the difference between the plans' projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair market value of the plans' assets.\n\nChanges to our pension and PRB plans' funded status can result from company actions, such as contributions or changes in plan provisions, or by gains and losses. Gains and losses are primarily a result of changes in assumptions and actual experience that differs from these assumptions. Major assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets (EROA). These gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit (income) expense.\n\nA  calculated  'market-related  value'  of  our  plan  assets  is  used  to  develop  the  amount  of  deferred  asset  gains  or  losses  to  be amortized. The market-related value of assets is equal to the fair value of assets adjusted to reflect the recognition, and subsequent amortization, of the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five-year period. The market-related value of assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets included in the net periodic benefit (income) expense.\n\nThe  Company  has  elected  to  use  the  'corridor'  approach  in  the  amortization  of  gains  and  losses,  which  limits  the  expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of the PBO or 10% of the market-related value of assets. Gains and losses exceeding the corridor are amortized in net periodic benefit (income) expense over either the projected average remaining employee service period or the projected average remaining lifetime of inactive participants depending on the plan.\n\nNet periodic benefit (income) expense is classified between operating and non-operating, whereby only the service cost component is included in operating profit and the remaining components are included in Non-service pension (income) expense.\n\nProduct  Performance  Obligations. We  extend  performance  and  operating  cost  guarantees  beyond  our  normal  service  and warranty  policies  for  extended  periods  on  some  of  our  products,  particularly  commercial  aircraft  engines.  Liability  under  such guarantees  is  based  upon  future  product  performance  and  durability.  We  accrue  for  such  costs  that  are  probable  and  can  be reasonably estimated. In  addition,  we  incur  discretionary  costs  to  service  our  products  in  connection  with  product  performance issues. The costs associated with these product performance and operating cost guarantees require estimates over the full terms of the  agreements,  and  require  management  to  consider  factors  such  as  the  extent  of  future  maintenance  requirements,  interval between flight and repair time and the future cost of material and labor to perform the services. These cost estimates are largely based upon historical experience. See 'Note 18: Guarantees' for further discussion.\n\nAccounting Pronouncements.

In addition, some of our suppliers or their sub-suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers. We also have internal dependencies on certain key GE manufacturing or other facilities. Disruptions in deliveries, capacity constraints, production disruptions up- or down-stream, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, including as a result of war, natural disasters (including the effects of climate change such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and more intense weather events), actual or threatened public health emergencies or other business continuity events, adversely affect our operations and, depending on the length and severity of the disruption, can limit our ability to meet our commitments to customers or significantly impact our operating profit or cash flows. Quality, capability, compliance and sourcing issues experienced by third-party providers can also adversely affect our costs, margin rates and the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and result in liability and reputational harm; the harm to us could be significant if, for example, a quality issue at a supplier or with components that we integrate into our products results in a widespread quality issue across one of our product lines or our installed base of equipment. In addition, while we require our suppliers to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate controls to protect information we provide to them, they may be the victim of a cyber-related attack that could lead to the compromise of the Company's intellectual property, personal data or other confidential information, or to production downtimes and operational disruptions that could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. An unknown security vulnerability or malicious software embedded in a supplier's product that is later integrated into a GE product could lead to a vulnerability in the security of GE's product or if used internally in the GE network environment to a compromise of the GE network, which could potentially lead to the loss of information or operational disruptions.\n\nFINANCIAL RISKS. Financial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including funding and liquidity risks, such as risk related to our credit ratings and our availability and cost of funding; credit risk; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligations (whether on- or off-balance sheet) as they arise, and could potentially impact our financial condition or overall safety and soundness. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a customer or counterparty failure to meet its contractual obligations, and we face credit risk arising from both our industrial businesses and from our remaining financial services operations.\n\nBorrowings - We may face risks related to our debt levels, particularly if we face severely adverse market conditions. We have significantly reduced our debt levels over the past several years through debt tenders and other liability management actions, and we expect to continue to do so with cash flows from operations, as well as proceeds from asset sales and dispositions, including our stakes in Baker Hughes and AerCap. If we are unable to generate cash flows in accordance with our plans, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as increasing borrowing under credit lines, reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures or other actions. In addition, we have significant pension and run-off insurance liabilities that are sensitive to numerous factors and assumptions that we use in our pension liability, GAAP insurance reserve and statutory insurance calculations. Our debt levels could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with lower debt levels that may have greater financial flexibility to secure additional funding for their operations, pursue strategic acquisitions, finance long-term projects or take other actions. Significant debt levels could also pose risks in the event of recession or adverse industry-specific conditions. In addition, elevated debt may limit our ability to obtain new debt financing on favorable terms in the future, particularly if coupled with downgrades of our credit ratings or a deterioration of capital markets conditions more generally.\n\nLiquidity - Failure to meet our cash flow targets, or additional credit downgrades, could adversely affect our liquidity, funding costs and related margins. We rely primarily on cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows from our operating businesses, cash generated from asset sales and dispositions, and short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities, to fund our operations, maintain a contingency buffer of liquidity and meet our financial obligations and capital allocation priorities. Failure to meet our cash flow objectives could adversely affect our financial condition or our credit ratings. There can be no assurance that we will not face credit downgrades as a result of factors such as the performance of our businesses, the failure to make progress as planned on the separation transactions and continued progress in decreasing GE's leverage or changes in rating application or methodology. Future downgrades could further adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and access to",

The U.S. Government has taken certain actions and enacted legislation to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on public health, the economy,  state  and  local  governments,  individuals,  and  businesses.  Since  the  pandemic  began,  Lockheed  Martin  has  remained committed to flowing down the benefits received from the DoD's modification of the progress payment rate to our supply chain partners. As of December 31, 2021, we have received approximately $1.5 billion of net accelerated progress payments, the majority of which were in 2020. We continue to use accelerated progress payments and cash on hand to accelerate payments to our suppliers. As of December 31, 2021, we have accelerated $2.2 billion of payments to our suppliers that are due by their terms in future periods.  We  will  continue  to  monitor  risk  driven  by  the  pandemic  and,  based  on  our  current  assessment,  we  will  continue  to accelerate payments to our suppliers based on risk assessed need through the end of 2022. Consistent with our current acceleration approach, we will prioritize small and COVID-19 impacted businesses.\n\nOn March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) into law. ARPA eased funding rules for single-employer defined benefit pension plans by extending the amortization of funding shortfalls and enhancing interest rate stabilization,  which  has  the  effect  of  reducing  the  funding  requirements  for  our  single-employer  defined  benefit  pension  plans beginning in 2021 and reducing the amount of CAS pension costs allocated to our U.S. Government contracts beginning in 2022.

Lockheed Martin (LMT) provides a specific 2022 cash from operations guidance of at least $7.9 billion, factoring in a potential $500 million impact from changes in R&D tax treatment, which reflects a forward-looking capital planning strategy tied to regulatory shifts and pension liabilities. United Parcel Service (UPS) discloses that it used cash from operations to fund the acquisition of Roadie, Inc., a strategic move to expand its same-day delivery capabilities within the Supply Chain Solutions segment. While the exact dollar amount for the Roadie acquisition is not specified, the use of operational cash underscores UPS\u2019s focus on growth through technology-enabled service expansion.

We  similarly  enter  into  long-term  agreements  with  suppliers  and  subcontractors  for  goods  and  services  in support of these contracts and programs with payment terms that are generally aligned with the payment terms from our customers. In some instances, we require advance payments or deposits from our customers, which help fund our purchase commitments and reduce the risk of customer performance.\n\nAdditionally, we have significant liabilities under our defined benefit retirement plans. As these liabilities are settled using plan assets, our future cash requirements associated with these liabilities are generally limited to  the  annual  cash  contributions  to  these  plans  required  in  accordance  with  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS) regulations. See Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.\n\nOther obligations, such as scheduled principal and interest payments on our fixed-rate notes, and scheduled payments  in  accordance  with  our  lease  agreements  are  expected  to  be  satisfied  using  cash  generated  from operations.

Although the federal contractor vaccine mandate has been enjoined, we continue to encourage all employees to be vaccinated, including booster shots. We had  taken  steps  to  comply  with  the  federal  contractor  vaccine  mandate  across  our  workforce  until  it  was  enjoined. As  of December 31, 2021, more than 96% of our U.S. employee population had been vaccinated or received an approved exception. If the mandate is reinstated, or new mandates implemented, it is uncertain to what extent compliance with any such vaccine mandates may result in adverse impacts such as workforce attrition for us or our suppliers or reduce morale or efficiency. If the adverse impact is significant for us or our suppliers, our operations and ability to execute on our contracts could be adversely affected.\n\nThe  ultimate  impact  of  COVID-19  on  our  operations  and  financial  performance  in  future  periods,  including  our  ability  to execute  our  programs  in  the  expected  timeframe,  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  future  pandemic-related  developments, including  the  duration  of  the  pandemic,  potential  subsequent  waves  of  COVID-19  infection  or  potential  new  variants,  the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, supplier impacts and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread,  including  the  implementation  of  any  federal,  state,  local  or  foreign  vaccine  mandates,  all  of  which  are uncertain  and  cannot  be  predicted.  The  long-term  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  government  budgets  and  other  funding  priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our products and services are also difficult to predict but could negatively affect our future results and performance.\n\n## 2022 Financial Trends\n\nWe expect 2022 net sales to decrease by approximately 2% from 2021 levels. The projected decline is driven by declines at three of the four business areas (MFC, RMS, and Space). Specifically, these decreases are driven by the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Space, the 2021 delivery of a training system on an international pilot training program at RMS not projected to repeat in 2022, as well as a decrease in Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) volume at MFC due to withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Total business segment operating margin in 2022 is expected to be approximately 10.9% and cash from operations in 2022 is expected to be greater than or equal to $7.9 billion. Cash from  operations  assumes  no  pension  contributions;  and  includes  an  estimated  potential  impact  in  2022  of  approximately  $500 million from the provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that went into effect on January 1, 2022 eliminating the option to immediately  deduct  research  and  development  expenditures  in  the  period  incurred  and  requiring  companies  to  amortize  such expenditures over five years. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when these provisions are deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. See 'Income Tax Expense' below and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding potential impacts of changes in tax laws and regulations, including the treatment of research and development costs.\n\nThe outlook for 2022 also assumes continued support and funding of our programs, a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, known impacts of COVID-19, and the continued acceleration of supplier payments, with a focus on small and at-risk businesses. No additional impacts to the company's operations, supply chain, or financial results as a result of continued COVID-19 disruption have been incorporated into our outlook for 2022 as the company cannot predict how the pandemic will evolve or what impact it will continue to have. The ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our financial results remain uncertain and there can be no assurance that our underlying assumptions are correct. Additionally, the company's outlook for 2022 assumes that there will not be significant reductions in customer budgets, changes in funding priorities and that the U.S. Government will not operate under a continuing resolution for an extended period in which new contract and program starts are restricted. It also does not incorporate the pending acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2022 net sales, business segment operating margin, and cash flows.\n\nWe expect a total net FAS/CAS pension benefit of approximately $2.3 billion in 2022 based on a 2.875% discount rate (a 37.5 basis point increase from the end of 2020), an approximate 10.5% return on plan assets in 2021, and a 6.50% expected long-term rate  of  return  on  plan  assets  in  future  years,  among  other  assumptions. We do not expect to make required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2022.\n\n## Portfolio Shaping Activities\n\nWe  continuously  strive  to  strengthen  our  portfolio  of  products  and  services  to  meet  the  current  and  future  needs  of  our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\n\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that",

Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  the  particular  program,  such  as  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under  contract.  The  sales  prices  for  all  undelivered  units  within  the  accounting  quantity  include  an  escalation adjustment  for  inflation  that  is  updated  quarterly.  Cost  estimates  are  based  largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence  these  estimates  include  production  rates,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  customer  and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, COVID-19 disruptions, and inflationary or deflationary trends.\n\nTo  ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  reviewed  and  updated  on  a quarterly  basis.  This  includes  reassessing  the  accounting  quantity.  Changes  in  estimates  of  program  gross  profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs  already  included  in  inventory  exceed  estimated  revenues  from  the  program,  a  loss  is  recorded  in  the  current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nThe 747, 767 and 777X programs have near break-even margins, and the 787 program has zero margin at December 31, 2021. Adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in additional earnings charges in future periods.\n\n777X Program During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X to late 2023 and recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program. The revised schedule and reach-forward loss reflected  a  number  of  factors,  including  an  updated  assessment  of  global  certification  requirements  informed  by continued discussions with regulators and a management decision in the fourth quarter of 2020 to make modifications to  the  aircraft's  design,  an  updated  assessment  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  market  demand  and  discussions  with  our customers with respect to aircraft delivery timing. These factors resulted in adjustments to production rates and the program  accounting  quantity,  increased  change  incorporation  costs,  and  associated  customer  and  supply  chain impacts. The  initial  accounting  quantity  of  350  airplanes  established  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020  consists  of  777X passenger airplanes and remained unchanged during 2021.\n\nWe are working towards reaching TIA which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA and certification  will  ultimately  be  determined  by  the  regulators,  and  further  determinations  with  respect  to  anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases.\n\nWe continue to anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. The 777X program has near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2021. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reachforward losses on the 777X program in future periods, which may be material.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT\n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2020 (at left) and 2021 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes  these  charts  internally  to  visually  communicate  with  the  company's  Board  of  Directors  and  employees.  The  bar  entitled  Other  includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation other operating (income) expenses .\n\nOperating profit was $6.878 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.325 billion, or 51 percent, compared with $4.553 billion in 2020. The increase was due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization, higher profit from Financial Products and lower restructuring expenses (included in other), partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable  manufacturing  costs reflected increased freight and higher material costs. In addition, unfavorable period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, and higher labor costs. Unfavorable period manufacturing costs were mostly offset by favorable cost absorption and lower warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased more during 2021 than during 2020.\n\nHigher  SG&amp;A/R&amp;D  expenses  reflected  higher  short-term  incentive  compensation  expense  and  investments  aligned  with  the company's strategy for profitable growth, including higher labor costs and acquisition-related expenses.\n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to no short-term incentive compensation expense recognized in 2020. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. For 2022, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $1.0 billion.\n\nOperating profit margin was 13.5 percent in 2021, compared with 10.9 percent in 2020.\n\n",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  (PCAOB),  the  Corporation's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2021,  based  on criteria  established  in Internal  Control -Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  and  our  report  dated  February  4,  2022,  expressed  an  unqualified opinion on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud.  Our  audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included  evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe  critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current-period  audit  of  the  financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Capitalization of Properties -Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe  Corporation's  operations  are  highly  capital  intensive  and  their  large  network  of  assets  turns  over  on  a continuous basis. Each year, the Corporation develops a capital program for both the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of new assets. In determining whether costs should be capitalized, the Corporation exercises significant judgment in determining whether expenditures meet the applicable minimum units of property criteria and extend the useful life, improve the safety of operations, or improve the operating efficiency of existing assets. The Corporation capitalizes all costs of capital projects necessary to make assets ready for their intended use and because a portion of the Corporation's assets are self-constructed, management also exercises significant judgment  in  determining  the  amount  of  material,  labor,  work  equipment,  and  indirect  costs  that  qualify  for capitalization. Properties, net were $54,871 million as of December 31, 2021 and, during 2021, the Corporation's capital investments were $2.9 billion.\n\nWe identified the capitalization of property as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment exercised by management in determining whether costs meet the criteria for capitalization. This, in turn, required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the criteria to capitalize costs were met and to evaluate sufficiency of audit evidence to support management's conclusions.",

      "answer": "Boeing faces significant near-term principal payment obligations, with $17.7 billion due over the next three years, raising concerns about liquidity and reliance on capital markets. Raytheon Technologies, in contrast, issued $12.9 billion in long-term debt in 2023, indicating a strategy of leveraging debt markets to support share repurchases and maintain financial flexibility. UPS plans to manage its $1.5 billion in senior notes maturing in 2024 through a combination of cash from operations and potential refinancing, supported by strong operational cash flows and disciplined capital allocation. Together, these approaches highlight differing liquidity strategies: Boeing faces higher refinancing risk, Raytheon is actively tapping debt markets for shareholder returns, and UPS maintains a conservative, operations-driven funding model.",

General Dynamics notes that a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate would increase its pension obligation by $536 million as of December 31, 2021, and defers recognition of benefit costs for government retirement plans until they can be allocated to contracts. UPS, on the other hand, emphasizes defined contribution plans, with matching contributions totaling $153 million in 2021 and a structured retirement contribution of 3% to 8% of eligible pay for employees hired after 2016, with no direct liability for government-sponsored plans internationally. Together, these disclosures reveal differing strategic approaches: EMR and GD focus on defined benefit plans with significant sensitivity to interest rate assumptions, while UPS has shifted toward defined contribution models with structured employer contributions and limited exposure to long-term pension liabilities.",

          "chunk_text": "## LONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist. If the Company determines that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk. Estimates of future sales, operating results, cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including such factors as the general level of market interest rates, expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served, particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time.\n\n## RETIREMENT PLANS\n\nThe Company maintains a prudent long-term investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations. The determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions, including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the Company's assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods. The Company's principal U.S. defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $513 in total (approximately 16 percent in excess of the projected benefit obligation), including unfunded plans totaling $162. The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $57, including unfunded plans totaling $236. The Company contributed a total of $43 to defined benefit plans in 2022 and expects to contribute approximately $40 in 2023. At year-end 2022, the discount rate for U.S. plans was 5.64 percent, and was 2.92 percent in 2021. The assumed investment return on plan assets was 6.00 percent in 2022, 6.50 percent in 2021 and 6.75 percent in 2020, and will be 6.00 percent for 2023. While management believes its assumptions used are appropriate, actual experience may differ. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the U.S. and non-U.S. discount rates would have increased the total projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2022 by $100 and increased fiscal 2023 pension expense by $15. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase fiscal 2023 pension expense by $15. See Note 12.\n\n## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nThe Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos) and other matters, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivables. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. See Note 13.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid (received) on items included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the",

          "chunk_text": "As of December 31, 2021, we completed qualitative assessments for our reporting units as the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded the respective carrying values based on our most recent quantitative assessments, which were performed as of December 31, 2018, for the Aerospace, Marine Systems and Combat Systems reporting units, and as of December 31, 2020, for the Technologies reporting unit.  Our qualitative assessments, including consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, did not present indicators of impairment for the reporting units.\n\nCommitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the normal course of business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities  and  costs  associated  with  these  matters  requires  the  use  of  judgment.  We  record  a  charge  against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known.\n\nRetirement Plans. Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates, which are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. For a discussion of our assumptions and any changes to these assumptions, as well as the impact of these changes, which is reported as an actuarial gain or loss in the reconciliation of the change in the benefit obligation, see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The key assumption is the interest rates used to discount estimated future pension benefits. We base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected  benefit  payout  period.  The  effect  of  a  25-basis-point  increase  or  decrease  in  the  discount  rate assumption on the December 31, 2021, pension benefit obligation is ($509) and $536, respectively.\n\nAs described under Other Contract Costs in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts. Therefore, the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the retirement benefit cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results.\n\n## GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nThe  outstanding  notes  described  in  Note  K  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Item  8,  issued  by General Dynamics Corporation (the parent), are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured, joint and several  basis  by  several  of  the  parent's  100%-owned  subsidiaries  (the  guarantors).  The  guarantee  of  each guarantor ranks equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of such guarantor. A listing of the guarantors is included in an exhibit to this Form 10-K.\n\nBecause  the  parent  is  a  holding  company,  its  cash  flow  and  ability  to  service  its  debt,  including  the outstanding  notes,  depends  on  the  performance  of  its  subsidiaries  and  the  ability  of  those  subsidiaries  to distribute cash to the parent, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the outstanding notes have a direct claim only against the parent and the guarantors.\n\nUnder the relevant indenture, the guarantee of each guarantor is limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without rendering the guarantee voidable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## International Pension Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor various defined benefit plans covering certain of our international employees. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit plans in Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, many of our international employees are covered by government-sponsored retirement and pension plans. We are not directly responsible for providing benefits to participants of government-sponsored plans.\n\n## U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor postretirement medical plans in the U.S. that provide healthcare benefits to our non-union retirees, as well as select union retirees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who are not otherwise covered by multiemployer plans. Generally, this includes employees with at least 10 years of service who have reached age 55 and employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits from a Company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans. These benefits have been provided to certain retirees on a noncontributory basis; however, in many cases, retirees are required to contribute all or a portion of the total cost of the coverage.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nWe sponsor a defined contribution plan for employees not covered under collective bargaining agreements, and several smaller defined contribution plans for certain employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. We match, in shares of UPS common stock or cash, a portion of the participating employees' contributions. Matching contributions charged to expense were $153, $139 and $130 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nIn addition to current benefits under the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan, non-union employees hired after July 1, 2016, receive a retirement contribution. UPS contributes 3% to 8% of eligible pay to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service and business unit. Contributions under this plan are subject to maximum compensation and contribution limits for a taxqualified defined contribution plan as prescribed by the IRS. The UPS Restoration Savings Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above. Contributions charged to expense were $107, $84 and $67 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nOn June 23, 2017, the Company amended the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan so that non-union employees who currently participate in the UPS Retirement Plan will, in addition to current benefits under the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan, earn a retirement contribution beginning January 1, 2023. UPS will contribute 5% to 8% of eligible compensation to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service. The amendment also provides for transition contributions for certain participants. There was no impact to the statements of consolidated income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 as a result of this change.\n\nContributions are also made to defined contribution money purchase plans under certain collective bargaining agreements. Amounts charged to expense were $112, $107 and $97 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n\nInformation about net periodic benefit cost for the company-sponsored pension and postretirement defined benefit plans is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

These differences in scale and trend suggest varying levels of working capital tied to receivables, with UPS having the largest exposure and MMM showing more stability.",

      "question": "How do Emerson (EMR), Lockheed Martin (LMT), and Union Pacific (UNP) each reflect the importance and trends in 'Cash Provided by Operating Activities' in their 2024 financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their cash flow dynamics and strategic priorities?",
      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) reported a significant increase in 'Cash Provided by Operating Activities' from $637 million in 2023 to $3,332 million in 2024, driven by improved operating performance and adjustments like depreciation and changes in working capital. Lockheed Martin (LMT) noted a decrease in free cash flow of $942 million compared to 2023, largely due to a decline in cash provided by operating activities, despite lower capital expenditures. Union Pacific (UNP) emphasized the importance of the cash flow conversion rate, linking it to their ability to generate cash internally without external financing, and provided a reconciliation from 'Cash Provided by Operating Activities' to this non-GAAP measure. Together, these perspectives highlight varying trends and strategic emphases: EMR improved operational cash generation, LMT faced operational cash flow headwinds, and UNP prioritized cash flow efficiency and transparency through non-GAAP reporting.",

      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) states that a 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rates would increase its 2025 pension expense by $15 million, and a 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected return on plan assets would also increase pension expense by $15 million. Raytheon (RTX) emphasizes that changes in discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, and other actuarial assumptions could significantly affect pension expense, equity, and contributions, though it does not quantify the exact sensitivity. Union Pacific (UNP) provides a table showing that a 0.25% decrease in discount rates would increase pension expense by $1 million, while a 0.25% decrease in expected return on plan assets would increase expense by $12 million. This comparative analysis reveals that EMR and UNP face more precisely defined short-term financial impacts from pension assumption changes, while RTX acknowledges exposure but without specific quantification, suggesting differing levels of transparency and sensitivity among the three companies.",

      "answer": "Boeing reported an actuarial loss of $225 million (net of tax of $1 million) for 2024, primarily due to remeasurement of pension and postretirement benefit obligations. FedEx noted that its U.S. Pension Plan achieved a 6.80% return in 2024, slightly above the 6.50% expected return, with the weighted-average discount rate rising to 5.53%, indicating improved liability valuation. Raytheon attributed its 2024 actuarial loss to actual asset returns falling below expected levels, despite an increase in discount rates. This reveals that Boeing and Raytheon experienced underperformance in pension asset returns, while FedEx slightly outperformed expectations, suggesting differing sensitivities to market volatility and discount rate changes across the three firms.",

      "question": "How do the 2024 operating profit margins of Emerson, GE, and RTX compare, and what do they suggest about each company's cost control and profitability trends?",
      "answer": "In 2024, GE reported an operating profit margin of 20.7%, reflecting a 330 basis point improvement driven by higher segment profit and better operational execution. RTX disclosed an operating profit margin of 8.1%, a rebound from 5.2% in 2023, indicating improved profitability and cost management. Emerson did not explicitly disclose its 2024 operating profit margin, but it emphasized the metric as a key indicator of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability, suggesting a focus on maintaining or improving margins through operational actions. Comparing these, GE appears to be outperforming both Emerson and RTX in terms of margin expansion, while RTX shows signs of recovery. Emerson's lack of a direct figure implies either a stable margin or a strategic decision not to highlight it, though the company's framing underscores its importance in evaluating business performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Safe Harbor Statement\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains v arious forward-looking statements and includes assumptions concerning Emerson's operations, future results and prospects. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later dev elopments. In connection with the 'safe harbor' prov isions of the Priv ate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson prov ides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - 'Risk Factors,' which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or ev ents to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement the Company's financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain 'non-GAAP financial measures,' as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or div estitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management's control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believ es that the following non-GAAP financial measures prov ide inv estors and analysts useful insight into the Company's financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternativ e to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nUnderlying sales, which exclude the impact of significant acquisitions, div estitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are prov ided to facilitate relev ant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact ov erall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure: net sales ).\n\nOperating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrativ e expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit div ided by net sales) are indicativ e of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to ev aluate past performance and actions required to improv e profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense, net, related party interest income, and income taxes) and total segment EBIT, and EBIT margin (defined as EBIT div ided by net sales) and total segment EBIT margin, are financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes. Adjusted EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA (defined as earnings excluding interest expense, net, related party interest income, income taxes, intangibles amortization expense, restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees, and certain gains, losses or impairments) and adjusted EBITA margin and adjusted segment EBITA margin (defined as adjusted EBITA div ided by net sales) are measures used by management to evaluate the Company's operational performance, as they exclude the impact of acquisition-related inv estments and nonoperational items. EBITDA (defined as EBIT excluding depreciation and amortization) and EBITDA margin (defined as EBITDA div ided by net sales) are also used as measures of the Company's current operating performance, as they exclude the impact of capital and acquisition-related inv estments. Adjusted EBITDA (defined as EBITDA excluding restructuring expense, first year purchase accounting related items and transaction fees, and certain gains, losses or impairments) and adjusted EBITDA margin (defined as Adjusted EBITDA div ided by net sales) are also used to exclude the impact of non-operational items. All of these are commonly used financial measures utilized by management to ev aluate performance (U.S. GAAP measures: pretax earnings or pretax profit margin, segment earnings or segment margin ).\n\nEarnings and earnings per share excluding certain gains and losses, impairments, restructuring costs, impacts of acquisitions or div estitures, amortization of intangibles, discrete taxes, or other items prov ide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2024 - $2.5 billion pre-tax  actuarial gain related to benefit obligations:\n\n- Discount Rates ($2.8 billion pre-tax  gain): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans increased from 5.40% as of December 31, 2023 to 5.85% as of December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in treasury yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($0.3 billion pre-tax  loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## 2023 - $2.4 billion pre-tax  actuarial loss related to benefit obligations:\n\n- Discount Rates ($2.3 billion pre-tax  loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 5.77% as of December 31, 2022 to 5.40% as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($0.1 billion pre-tax  loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higheryielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term capital growth to meet future obligations while minimizing risk ex posures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by our investment committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments, U.S. government securities, derivatives and other instruments. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fix ed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; hedge funds, equity securities and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund; and derivatives and other instruments primarily valued using pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign currency exchange rates and investment forward price. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.",

      "question": "How have Emerson (EMR), General Dynamics (GD), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) each been impacted by changes in net earnings, and what do these changes reveal about their respective financial strategies and risk exposures in 2024?",
      "answer": "Emerson (EMR) experienced a significant decline in net earnings in 2024, with net earnings from continuing operations dropping to $1,618 million from $2,286 million in 2023, a 29% decrease, largely due to acquisition-related amortization and a loss on the Copeland note receivable. General Dynamics (GD) showed consistent growth in net earnings, increasing from $3,390 million in 2021 to $3,782 million in 2024, indicating strong operational performance and disciplined financial management. Lockheed Martin (LMT), while not directly disclosing net earnings figures, highlighted risks such as legal contingencies, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory changes that could negatively impact future earnings and shareholder returns. This contrast suggests that EMR is navigating post-acquisition headwinds, GD is maintaining steady profitability, and LMT is proactively managing external risks that could constrain earnings growth.",

Results in 2023 included interest income on undeployed proceeds from the Copeland transaction of $141 ($108 after-tax, $0.19 per share).\n\nInterest income from related party was $86 and $41 in 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely and reflects non-cash interest income on the Copeland note receiv able, which was capitalized to the carrying v alue of the note through the date of the sale agreement.\n\n## EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n\nPretax earnings from continuing operations of $2,020 decreased $883 in 2024, down 30 percent compared with 2023, which included the impact of acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization, higher amortization due to the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, and the loss on the Copeland note receiv able discussed abov e. Earnings increased $191 in Intelligent Dev ices and decreased $140 in Software and Control.\n\nPretax earnings from continuing operations of $2,903 increased $471 in 2023, up 19 percent compared with 2022. Earnings increased $447 in Intelligent Devices and decreased $27 in Software and Control. See the Business Segments discussion that follows and Note 20.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome taxes were $415, $642 and $549 for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely, resulting in effectiv e tax rates of 21 percent, 22 percent and 23 percent in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely. The current year rate included a $57 ($0.10 per share) benefit related to discrete tax items and a benefit related to the filing of the prior year U.S. tax return, partially offset by unfav orable impacts from inv entory step-up amortization and the div estiture losses (see Note 4), which were non-deductible for tax purposes. In total, the net impact of these items benefited the rate by approximately 1 percentage point. See Note 16.\n\n## NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nNet earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders in 2024 were $1,618, down 29 percent compared with 2023, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.82, down 29 percent compared with $3.96 in 2023, reflecting the impact of acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization, higher amortization due to the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, and the loss on the Copeland note receiv able discussed above. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $5.49 compared with $4.44 in the prior year. See the analysis of adjusted earnings per share in the Ov erv iew section for further details. Earnings from discontinued operations attributable to common stockholders in 2024 were $350 ($0.61 per share) and included the gain on the sale of the Company's 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland of $539 ($435 after-tax). Earnings from discontinued operations in 2023 were $10,933 ($18.92 per share), which included the $8.4 billion after-tax gain on the Copeland transaction and the $2.1 billion after-tax gain on the div estiture of InSinkErator. See Note 5. Net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $1,968 ($3.43 per share) compared with $13,219 ($22.88 per share) in 2023.\n\nNet earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders in 2023 were $2,286, up 21 percent compared with 2022, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.96, up 25 percent compared with $3.16 in 2022, reflecting strong operating results.

In addition to incurring direct costs to implement any climate-change related laws, regulations or policies, we may see indirect costs rise, such as increased energy or material costs, as a result of policies affecting other sectors of the economy. Although most of these increased costs likely would be recoverable through pricing, to the extent that the increase in our costs as a result of these policies are greater than our competitors, we may be less competitive on future bids or the total increased cost in our industry's products and services could result in lower demand from our customers. We monitor developments in climate change-related laws, regulations and policies for their potential effect on us, however, we currently are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential costs associated with such developments. In addition, climate change-related litigation and investigations have increased in recent years and any claims or investigations against us could be costly to defend and our business could be adversely affected by the outcome.\n\n## We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty.\n\nOur business may be adversely affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required by U.S. GAAP, we estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable  considering  the  facts  and  circumstances  known  to  us  at  a  particular  point  in  time.  Subsequent  developments  in  legal  proceedings  may  affect  our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements. For a description of our current legal proceedings, see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, 'Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  and  'Note  14  -  Legal  Proceedings,  Commitments  and  Contingencies'  included  in  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\n\n## There can be no assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend or to repurchase shares of our common stock.\n\nCash dividend payments and share repurchases are subject to limitations under applicable laws and the discretion of our Board of Directors and are determined after considering then-existing conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements and cash deployment alternatives. Our payment of dividends and share repurchases could vary from historical practices or our stated expectations.  Decreases in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated with employee benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce net earnings and stockholders' equity. Under certain circumstances, a deficit in stockholders' equity could limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Maryland state law in the future. In addition, the timing and amount of share repurchases under Board of Directors approved share repurchase plans may differ from stated expectations and is within the discretion of management and will depend on many factors, including our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or to borrow money from available financing sources, our results of operations, capital requirements and applicable law.\n\n## ITEM 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 1C.    Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe believe cybersecurity is critical to advancing our 21st Century Security vision and enabling our digital transformation efforts. As an aerospace and defense company, we face a multitude of cybersecurity threats that range from attacks common to most industries, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, to attacks from more advanced and persistent,  highly  organized  adversaries,  including  nation  state  actors,  some  of  which  target  the  defense  industrial  base  and  other  critical infrastructure sectors. Our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting us or any of these entities could materially adversely affect our operations, performance and results of operations. These cybersecurity threats and related risks make it imperative that we strive to be a leader in the information security field, and we ex pend considerable resources on cybersecurity.\n\nOur corporate information security organization has implemented a governance structure and processes to assess, identify, manage and report cybersecurity risks. We also have a corporate-wide counterintelligence and insider threat detection program to proactively identify external and internal threats and mitigate those threats in a timely manner. As a defense contractor, we must comply with extensive regulations, including requirements imposed by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) related to adequately safeguarding controlled unclassified information (CUI) and reporting cybersecurity incidents to the DoD. We have implemented cybersecurity policies and frameworks based on industry and governmental",

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) discloses a policy of accruing environmental remediation liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable, with no specific dollar figure provided but noting that recoveries from insurers or third parties are recorded when realization is deemed probable. Lockheed Martin (LMT) highlights that environmental remediation costs, particularly related to PFAS contamination, may be significantly impacted by new regulatory standards, potentially increasing cleanup obligations at many of its sites. Raytheon (RTX) quantifies its environmental remediation reserve at $760 million as of December 31, 2023, down from $798 million in 2022, and states that it does not expect these liabilities to materially affect its financial condition or liquidity. Together, these disclosures indicate that while all three companies face environmental remediation exposure, the scale and strategic framing of these liabilities differ, with RTX providing a concrete reserve figure, LMT emphasizing regulatory risk escalation, and BA focusing on contingent recovery mechanisms.",
