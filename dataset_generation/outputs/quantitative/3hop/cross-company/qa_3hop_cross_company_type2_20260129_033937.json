      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reported corporate overhead costs and other, net at $652 million in 2023, reflecting a significant portion of its total corporate operating loss. PepsiCo (PEP) includes plant overhead as part of cost of sales, while distribution and merchandising costs are classified under selling, general, and administrative expenses, indicating a segmented cost management approach. Procter & Gamble (PG) notes that corporate costs include allocated overheads tied to Enterprise Markets, Global Business Services, and Corporate Functions activities, suggesting a centralized overhead structure. Together, these approaches highlight differing strategies: CL faces high overhead pressures, PEP segments costs operationally, and PG centralizes corporate overhead functions.",

TGT reported higher amortization at $136 million and significantly higher interest at $71 million. WMT had the highest amortization at $755 million and interest of $326 million.

      "answer": "PepsiCo (PEP) reports that approximately $664 million of its total projected pension benefit obligation is related to unfunded plans due to unfavorable tax treatment. Procter & Gamble (PG) explains that the underfunding of pension benefits is largely due to the lack of legal requirements or financial incentives to pre-fund in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, with benefit payments made directly from company cash as they come due. Philip Morris (PM) shows a funded status of $9,030 million in plan assets against a projected benefit obligation of $10,456 million, resulting in a net liability of $1,426 million as of December 31, 2024. These differences highlight distinct global pension strategies: PEP avoids funding certain plans for tax reasons, PG aligns with local regulatory environments in non-U.S. markets, and PM maintains a relatively well-funded pension structure with significant actuarial gains and asset returns.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) successfully leveraged price increases in 2023, particularly in Europe, where net selling price increases of 9.5% contributed to a 7.5% rise in net sales, despite volume declines. Mondelez (MDLZ) faced volatility in input costs and acknowledged the risk that continued inflationary pressures could constrain its ability to raise prices effectively without impacting sales volumes or losing customers. Philip Morris (MO) highlighted its reliance on price increases to offset rising costs and maintain margins, but also noted the challenge of consumer down-trading to lower-priced alternatives in inflationary environments, which could limit the effectiveness of pricing strategies. Together, these perspectives show that while pricing is a key lever for maintaining profitability, its success is constrained by competitive dynamics, consumer sensitivity, and input cost volatility across the consumer staples sector.",

        "Hop 1: CL \u2192 Price Increases: CL reported net selling price increases of 9.5% in Europe, which drove a 7.5% increase in net sales despite volume declines of 4.5%.",
        "Hop 2: MDLZ \u2192 Price Increases: MDLZ cited risks around inflation and input cost volatility, noting that increases in product prices to cover higher costs may result in lower sales volumes or customer loss.",
        "Hop 3: MO \u2192 Price Increases: MO indicated that price increases are a key strategy to protect margins amid inflation, but consumer down-trading to discount brands poses a risk to volume and market share."

The significant differences in these values suggest varying short-term financial strategies or operational needs among the companies.

PEP, on the other hand, shows no participant contributions for its U.S. pension plans but reports $2 million in both 2024 and 2023 for international pension plans. TGT reports participant contributions of $10 million for its qualified pension plan and no contributions for nonqualified or international plans in 2024. These differences suggest that KO and TGT have more direct employee involvement in funding certain benefit plans, while PEP\u2019s U.S. pension participants do not contribute, possibly indicating a different benefit design or employer-funded model.",

Philip Morris (PM) reported only $7 million in current year tax additions for 2023, down from $12 million in the prior year, suggesting a relatively stable or reduced tax risk environment. Target (TGT) reported $128 million in current year tax additions for 2023, up from $115 million in 2022, showing a growing tax exposure likely tied to evolving retail and state tax regulations. The stark contrast in magnitude and trend across these companies highlights differing regulatory environments and strategic tax risk management approaches.",

      "answer": "Altria (MO) reported a significant increase in net earnings in 2023, reaching $8,130 million, indicating strong financial performance despite broader economic challenges. In contrast, Procter & Gamble (PG) explicitly noted that global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions, and foreign exchange volatility negatively impacted its net earnings and cash flows, particularly in markets like Russia, where its operations accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net earnings. Similarly, Philip Morris (PM) highlighted that geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East, along with inflationary pressures and currency fluctuations, could materially affect its net earnings and profitability.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) includes royalty rates among several critical assumptions used in impairment testing for equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets, alongside factors like sales volume, pricing, and discount rates. Procter & Gamble (PG) explicitly identifies royalty rates as one of the most significant assumptions in the fair value estimation of its Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and demonstrates sensitivity through a 50 basis-point decrease in royalty rates potentially triggering additional impairment. Philip Morris (PM) incorporates royalty rates as part of the significant assumptions reviewed by auditors during the fair value estimation of trademarks and customer relationships, with professionals validating the reasonableness of these rates. Together, these disclosures show that royalty rate assumptions are a material and sensitive input in the valuation of intangible assets across all three firms, though the degree of quantified sensitivity varies, with PG providing the most explicit modeling around potential impairment impacts.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reports noncurrent assets of $72 million in 2022, primarily tied to its pension and retiree benefit plans. Coca-Cola (KO) reports significantly higher noncurrent assets of $72,064 million, reflecting its broader investment in long-term assets such as equity method investments and global infrastructure. Mondelez (MDLZ) reports noncurrent assets of $71,949 million, indicating a stable long-term asset base despite a slight decline from the prior year. The disparity in scale and composition of noncurrent assets reveals differing asset strategies: CL focuses on benefit obligations, KO emphasizes long-term strategic investments, and MDLZ maintains a consistent noncurrent asset position.",

Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.\n\nOne or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the type, volume and mix of services we provide and the reimbursement we receive for health and wellness services rendered. Any of these developments could, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\n## Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our ex isting stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous ex ternal factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully ex ecute organizational changes, including our enterprise strategy and management transitions within our senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. We compete for talent with other retail and non-retail businesses, including, for ex ample, technology, health and wellness and fintech businesses, and invest significant resources in training and motivating our associates. Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including senior management and executive levels, could result in increased associate costs or make it more difficult to recruit and retain associates. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised or novel interpretations of ex isting labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws, including those related to worker classification, are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Illegal or inappropriate activ ity of our independent contractors or third-party serv ice prov iders could expose us to liability and adv ersely affect our business, reputation and financial performance.\n\nWe are subject to risks related to our engagement of independent contractors or other third-party service providers. The qualification processes and background checks we utilize when engaging independent contractors may not reveal all potentially relevant information, including accurate worker authorization information and criminal history. If these independent contractors engage in misconduct, consumers may not consider our goods and services safe, and we may receive negative press coverage. Further, we have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud with respect to unauthorized uses of another person's identity and use of fraudulent identification documents. Any physical injury, loss of life, fraud, property and/or financial damage caused by our independent contractors or third-party service providers could adversely affect our business reputation, which could negatively affect demand for our goods and services, lead to increased regulatory or litigation ex posure and adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\n\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market ex pectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, advertising and other higher-margin initiatives (which are ex pected to help drive our operating income growth at a rate faster than net sales over the long term), capital ex penditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of our performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\n\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and ex penses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using ex change rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.",

      "answer": "MDLZ reported total debt of $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.41, and highlighted plans to repay approximately $1.7 billion of maturing long-term debt in the next 12 months. PG maintained a higher total debt of $31.5 billion as of June 30, 2022, with a stable credit rating and a strategy focused on funding dividends and share repurchases through net debt increases. TGT, while not disclosing total debt directly, emphasized EBIT and EBITDA as key non-GAAP metrics to evaluate operational efficiency, excluding the impact of debt levels. These differences reveal that MDLZ is focused on moderate debt reduction and maturity management, PG leverages its strong credit rating to maintain higher debt for shareholder returns, and TGT emphasizes operational efficiency metrics that abstract away from debt structure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nwith our Simplify to Grow Program and for funding our strategic priorities. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.\n\n## Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:\n\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher amounts of net long-term debt repayments, higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid in 2021 than in 2020. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020.\n\n## Chipita Acquisition\n\nOn January 3, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of Chipita S.A. The cash consideration for Chipita totaled \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) and we assumed and substantially paid down \u20ac0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita's debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately \u20ac1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Cash paid for the business was raised from cash from operations and by issuing long-term debt in the third quarter of 2021. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures , and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for additional details.\n\n## Supply Chain Financing\n\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers are from 30 to 180 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We also facilitate voluntary supply chain financing ('SCF') programs through several participating financial institutions. Under these programs, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine invoices that they want to sell to participating financial institutions. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in SCF programs has no bearing on our payment terms or amounts due. Our responsibility is limited to making payments based upon the agreed-upon contractual terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF programs and we have no economic interest in the suppliers' decision to participate in the SCF programs. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheet. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers that participate in the SCF programs are outstanding.\n\n## Guarantees:\n\nAs discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies , we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2021, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.\n\n## Debt:\n\nThe nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.\n\nRefer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for a projection of long-term debt scheduled to mature (including current maturities and finance leases) in future periods. In the next 12 months, we expect to repay approximately $1.7 billion of maturing long-term debt including: $1.2 billion in July 2022 and $0.5 billion in September 2022. We fund ongoing debt maturities and other long-term obligations using cash on hand or we may refinance obligations with longterm debt or short-term financing (such as our commercial paper borrowings) depending on financing available, timing considerations, flexibility to raise funding and the cost of financing.\n\nDuring December 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new $7.0 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior $6.0 billion authority. As of December 31, 2021, all $7.0 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available.\n\nOur total debt was $19.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $20.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Our debt-tocapitalization ratio was 0.41 at December 31, 2021 and 0.42 at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average term of",

          "chunk_text": "Acquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $1.4 billion in 2022,  primarily  related  to  Beauty  acquisitions  of  Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA. Acquisition activity used $34 million in 2021, primarily related to a minor Health Care acquisition.\n\nProceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales were $110 million in 2022 and $42 million in 2021,  primarily from  fixed asset  sales  and  minor  brand divestitures.\n\nInvestment  Securities. Investments  provided  net  cash  of  $3 million  in  2022  primarily  from  the  sale  of  other  investments and  used  cash  of  $55  million  in  2021  primarily  from  the purchase of investment securities.\n\n## Financing Cash Flow\n\nNet  financing  activities  consumed  $14.9  billion  of  cash  in 2022, mainly due to treasury stock purchases and dividends to shareholders,  partially  offset  by  a  net  debt  increase  and  the impact of proceeds received from stock option exercises. Net financing  activities  consumed  $21.5  billion  in  cash  in  2021, mainly due to treasury stock purchases, dividends to shareholders  and  a  net  debt  reduction,  partially  offset  by  the impact of stock options.\n\nDividend  Payments. Our  first  discretionary  use  of  cash  is dividend  payments.  Dividends  per  common  share  increased 9% to $3.5227 per share in 2022. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $8.8 billion in 2022 and $8.3 billion in 2021. In April 2022, the Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.8698 to  $0.9133  per  share  on  Common  Stock  and  Series A  and  B Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) Convertible Class A Preferred  Stock.  This  is  the  66th  consecutive  year  that  our dividend  has  increased.  We  have  paid  a  dividend  for  132 consecutive years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.\n\nLong-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider  appropriate  after  evaluating  a  number  of  factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions  and  share  repurchase  activities)  and  the  overall cost  of  capital.  Total  debt  was  $31.5  billion  as  of  June  30, 2022, and $32.0 billion as of June 30, 2021. We generated $1.9 billion  from  net  debt  increases,  primarily  due  to  issuance  of bonds. In 2021, we used $3.9 billion for net debt reductions, including  $512  million  for  early  debt  extinguishment  costs related to the early retirement of $2.3 billion of debt.\n\nTreasury  Purchases. Total  share  repurchases  were  $10.0 billion in 2022 and $11.0 billion in 2021.\n\nImpact  of  Stock  Options  and  Other. The  exercise  of  stock options  and  other  financing  activities  generated  $2.0  billion and $1.6 billion of cash in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nAt  June  30,  2022,  our  current  liabilities  exceeded  current assets  by  $11.4  billion,  largely  due  to  short-term  borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.  The  Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various Western European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related  to  any  country  subject  to  exchange  controls  that significantly  restrict  our  ability  to  access  or  repatriate  the funds.  Under  current  law,  we  do  not  expect  restrictions  or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe  utilize  short-  and  long-term  debt  to  fund  discretionary items,  such  as  acquisitions  and  share  repurchases.  We  have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.\n\nOn  June  30,  2022,  our  short-term  credit  ratings  were  P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard &amp; Poor's), while our long-term credit  ratings  were  Aa3  (Moody's)  and  AA-  (Standard  &amp; Poor's), all with a stable outlook.\n\nWe  maintain  bank  credit  facilities  to  support  our  ongoing commercial  paper  program.  The  current  facility  is  an  $8.0 billion  facility  split  between  a  $3.2  billion  five-year  facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2026 and November 2022, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reports that advertising costs are included in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses and are expensed as incurred, while consumer and trade promotional programs like coupons are recorded as a reduction of sales. Altria accounts for consumer and trade promotion activities as a reduction of revenues, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year, and expenses consumer engagement programs as incurred, which are included in marketing, administration, and research costs. Philip Morris International incurs marketing costs related to advertising, consumer engagement, and trade promotions, with trade promotion costs recognized as a reduction of revenue based on estimated utilization rates derived from historical experience. The comparative analysis reveals that while all three companies recognize marketing costs as a significant component of their financial strategy, they differ in the timing and method of recognition\u2014Colgate treats some promotions as revenue reductions and others as SG&A, Altria integrates them more directly into revenue adjustments and operating costs, and PM relies heavily on historical data to estimate and recognize these expenses. This variation reflects differing internal controls, promotional strategies, and revenue recognition philosophies across the consumer staples sector.",

Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of the remaining inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and E quipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.\n\nDetermining the fair value of the Company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates and the selection of royalty rates and discount rates. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nAs a result of a reporting structure realignment, the Company reallocated the goodwill of a certain reporting unit from the Europe segment to the North America segment. Before and after the reporting structure realignment, the Company completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment was required. Refer to Note 13, Segment Information for additional information.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.",

We use certain factors to make this determination including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nSee Note 8. Investments in Equity Securities for additional information on our accounting policy for our former investment in JUUL.\n\n- Litigation Contingencies and Costs: We record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We expense litigation defense costs as incurred and include these costs in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. See Note 20. Contingencies .\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred, and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Revenue Recognition: Our businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. While our businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type, all sales contracts are similarly structured. These contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer. Our businesses satisfy all performance obligations within one year; therefore, we expense costs to obtain contracts as incurred and do not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations. There is no financing component because our businesses expect, at contract inception, that the period between when our businesses transfer product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less.\n\nOur businesses define net revenues as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. Our businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\n\nOur businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer. Our businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer. Our businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings. Our businesses record an allowance for returned goods, based principally on historical volume and return rates, which is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. We include expected payments for sales incentives in accrued marketing liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nPayment terms vary depending on product type. Our businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue, which we include in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized. PM USA primarily receives payments in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product. USSTC, Helix and NJOY receive substantially all payments within one business day of a customer obtaining control of the product. We include amounts due from customers in receivables on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n- Supplier Financing: We facilitate a voluntary supplier financing program under which participating suppliers may elect to sell receivables due from us to a third-party financial institution. Our payments are made on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier, and we have no economic interest in a supplier's sale of a receivable. All outstanding balances under the supplier financing program are recorded in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets.",

          "chunk_text": "Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, e-vapor and oral nicotine products. Our performance obligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers. PMI estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience, and these estimates are immaterial. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs for IQOS devices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized, based on a number of factors, including historical ex perience, product failure rates and warranty policies. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to  be  entitled  to  under  the  terms  of  the  contracts  with  customers,  historical  ex perience  of  discount  or  rebate  redemption,  where  relevant,  and  the  terms  of  any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve.\n\nGoodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets V aluation We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review, using either a qualitative or quantitative assessment for each of our reporting units. Where a qualitative assessment is followed, we determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists based on qualitative factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and competitive  conditions,  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  historical  financial  performance  and  significant  changes  within  the  reporting  unit.  If  the  qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. If the carrying value ex ceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we use the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global companies within the tobacco industry and a discounted cash flow model. To determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method. These discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for  forecasting  operating  cash  flows,  which  are  subject  to  changes  in  business  conditions,  such  as  volumes  and  prices,  costs  to  produce,  discount  rates  and estimated capital needs. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated, and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for all of our reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets with the exception of the three reporting units and nonamortizable intangible asset related to the Swedish Match segment for which we have performed a qualitative assessment. Based on this review, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Wellness and Healthcare reporting unit was lower than its carrying value. Consequently, PMI recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $665 million. Additionally, as a result of the impairment test of non-amortizable intangible assets, PMI recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $15 million. There was no impairment charge of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for our other reporting units. For additional information, see Item 8, Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment using a quantitative assessment for all of its reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets. As a result of this review, no impairment charges were required.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our goodwill was $16.6 billion, which is related to eleven geographical reporting units, each consisting of a group of markets with similar operating and economic characteristics, and the Wellness and Healthcare business. The estimated fair value of each of our twelve reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value as of December 31, 2024.\n\nInvestment in non-marketable equity securities -For  further  details,  see  Item  8,  Note  6. Related  Parties  -  Equity  Investments  and  Other to  our  consolidated financial statements\n\nMarketing  Costs  We  incur  certain  costs  to  support  our  products  through  programs  that  include  advertising,  marketing,  consumer  engagement  and  trade promotions. The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program.  For  volume-based  incentives  provided  to  customers,  management  continually  assesses  and  estimates,  by  customer,  the  likelihood  of  the  customer's achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made. For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.",

Target (TGT) reported a total tax provision of $1,961 million, indicating a significantly smaller but still substantial tax liability. Altria (MO) had the lowest of the three at $1,349 million, despite its strong earnings in the U.S., due to a large deferred tax benefit of $1,160 million that significantly reduced its overall tax burden. This comparison highlights how differences in geographic footprint, earnings distribution, and tax planning strategies influence each company's effective tax position.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) experienced higher commodity costs that negatively impacted operating income across multiple regions, including Latin America, North America, Asia Pacific, and Bottling Investments, despite favorable pricing initiatives. PepsiCo (PEP) reported that higher commodity costs, particularly for potatoes, sweeteners, and packaging, had an 11-percentage-point negative impact in North America and a 54-percentage-point drag in Europe, with AMESA facing a 70-percentage-point impact largely due to foreign exchange effects. In contrast, Procter & Gamble (PG) benefited from lower commodity costs, which contributed to a 230 basis-point improvement in net earnings margin within the Fabric & Home Care segment. This divergence suggests that while KO and PEP faced inflationary pressures that offset pricing gains, PG successfully leveraged cost reductions to enhance profitability.",

PG shows a gradual increase from 2.7% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2024, indicating a more conservative and slowly rising outlook. PM reports the lowest increase at 2.05% in 2023, up slightly from 1.98% in 2022, reflecting the most restrained assumption among the three.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola assumes an ultimate trend rate of 6.00%, projected to be reached by 2029, indicating a moderate long-term outlook for health care cost inflation. Mondelez projects a lower ultimate trend rate of 5.00% for U.S. plans, expected to stabilize by 2031, suggesting a more optimistic view on future health care cost containment. Altria, in contrast, assumes an ultimate trend rate of 5.0%, but expects to reach it by 2031 for postretirement benefits, aligning closely with Mondelez but applying it only to non-pension benefits. Together, these figures reveal differing corporate expectations about the long-term trajectory of health care costs, with KO anticipating a higher stabilized rate than MDLZ and MO.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive maintained a relatively low current portion of long-term debt at $20 million in 2023, indicating a conservative short-term debt repayment strategy. Costco, on the other hand, had a current portion of long-term debt of $103 million in 2023, which reflects a moderate near-term debt obligation as part of its capital structure. In contrast, Mondel\u0113z carried a significantly higher current portion of long-term debt at $2,101 million in 2023, suggesting a more aggressive short-term debt burden compared to the other two companies. These differences highlight varying liquidity strategies: Colgate appears to minimize near-term debt pressure, Costco manages a moderate level of short-term obligations, and Mondel\u0113z faces a substantial upcoming repayment schedule, which may influence its cash flow flexibility.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble assumes an average return on assets of 6.0% for pension plans and 8.5% for OPRB assets in 2024, with a 100 basis point change impacting annual after-tax expense by approximately $145 million. Philip Morris notes that a 50 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would impact its 2024 pension expense by approximately $41 million, reflecting a more moderate sensitivity. Target reported an expected return on assets of -$269 million in 2023, indicating a negative return assumption that contributed to a net pension benefit of $12 million. These differences highlight varying actuarial assumptions and sensitivities to market performance across the three companies.",

Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company's income approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the perpetual growth rate and discount rate assumptions.\n\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment- E-Vapor Reporting Unit\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's goodwill balance was $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, and the goodwill associated with the e-vapor reporting unit was $1.8 billion. Management conducts an annual review of goodwill for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require management to perform an interim review. Management used an income approach to estimate the fair values of the Company's reporting units. The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing ex pected future cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. In performing the 2024 valuation, management's cash flow analysis for the e-vapor reporting unit included significant judgments and assumptions related to volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rate and discount rate. During 2024, management's annual impairment test of goodwill resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the e-vapor reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to volume, perpetual growth rate, and discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the e-vapor reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the income approach; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the volume, perpetual growth rate and discount rate. Evaluating management's assumption related to volume involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the Company's e-vapor reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company's income approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the perpetual growth rate and discount rate assumptions.\n\n## /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nRichmond, Virginia\n\nJanuary 30, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since at least 1934, which is when the Company became subject to SEC reporting requirements.

          "chunk_text": "## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. G oodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that ex pected economic benefits will be provided.\n\nGoodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in ex cess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill during fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\n\nThe following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2025 and 2024:\n\n",

      "answer": "KO incorporates royalty rates as a key assumption in the fair value estimation of its trademarks, including the $760 million impairment charge for the BodyArmor trademark, where royalty rates were among the significant assumptions affecting valuation sensitivity. MDLZ utilizes royalty rates as part of its relief-from-royalty valuation method for brand names, alongside earnings growth and discount rates, in assessing the $17.8 billion indefinite-life intangible assets. PG explicitly ties the $12.8 billion carrying value of the Gillette brand to royalty rates derived from historical and projected profitability, with a 50 basis-point decrease in royalty rates potentially triggering further impairment. Together, these approaches show that all three companies rely heavily on royalty rates to estimate brand value, but differ in how they disclose the sensitivity of those estimates to changes in market and operational conditions.",

As described in Note 1, management performs an annual impairment test of its indefinite-lived intang ible assets, including trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill. Each impairment test may be qualitative or quantitative. Management performs their annual impairment tests as of June 29, 2024, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $760 million duringthe year ended December 31, 2024 related to their BodyArmor trademark in North America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|                                          | Auditing the valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill involved complex judgment due to the sig nificant estimation required in determining the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and related reporting units with goodwill, respectively.

Sig nificant assumptions used in the Company's fair value estimates included sales volume, pricing , royalty rates, long-termgrowth rates, and discount rates, as applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| HowWeAddressed the Matter in Our Audit   | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the desig n, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's interim review of impairment indicators, interim impairment test, and annual impairment tests for trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill. For example, we tested management's risk assessment process to determine whether to perform a quantitative or qualitative test, management's control over the evaluation of interimimpairment indicators, and management's review controls over the valuation models and underlyingassumptions used to develop such estimates. For impairment tests of reportingunits with goodwill, wealso tested controls over the determination of the carryingvalue of the reportingunits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                          | We tested the trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill based on our risk assessments. Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing sig nificant judgmental inputs to observable third party and industry sources, considering other observable market transactions, and evaluating the reasonableness of management's projected financial information by comparing to third party industry projections, third party economic growth projections, and other internal and external data. Weperformed sensitivity analyses of certain sig nificant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill and assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates. In addition, weinvolved specialists to assist in our evaluation of certain sig nificant assumptions used in the Company's valuation model. Wealso assessed the Company's related disclosures of its valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill. |\n",

A company's internal control ov er financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) prov ide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (iii)  prov ide  reasonable assurance regarding prev ention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could hav e a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control ov er financial reporting may not prev ent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any ev aluation of effectiv eness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe  critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  that  was communicated  or  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that  (i)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the consolidated  financial  statements  and  (ii)  inv olv ed  our  especially  challenging,  subjectiv e,  or  complex  judgments.

At  least  annually  management  assesses  indefinite-life  intangible assets for impairment and if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, management quantitativ ely tests the asset for impairment by comparing its estimated fair v alue with its carrying v alue. Management estimates fair v alue using sev eral accepted v aluation methods, including relief from  royalty,  excess  earnings  and  excess  margin,  that  utilize  estimates  of  future  sales,  earnings  growth  rates,  royalty  rates  and  discount  rates  to determine a brand name's fair v alue.\n\nThe  principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  indefinite-life  intangible  assets  annual  impairment assessments for certain brand names is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when dev eloping the fair v alue of the indefinite-life  intangible  assets  for  certain  brand  names;  (ii)  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectiv ity,  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates for certain brand names; and (iii) the audit effort inv olv ed the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter inv olv ed performing procedures and ev aluating audit ev idence in connection with forming our ov erall opinion on the consolidated financial  statements.  T hese  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiv eness  of  controls  relating  to  the  indefinite-life  intangible  assets  impairment assessments,  including  controls  ov er  the  annual  v aluation  of  certain  brand  names.

Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly ex ceed their underlying carrying values.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we determined the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax ) to reduce the carrying amount to be equivalent to the estimated fair value. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\n\nWhile we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge.\n\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.\n\nNet sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our G illette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the G illette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency  exchange  rates  and  business  activities  that  impact  market  share. As  a  result,  the  residual  growth  rates  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  a  sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\n\nThe discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\n\nThe royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.",

      "answer": "In 2022, price increases had distinct effects across the three companies. For KO, timing of price increases was cited as a factor contributing to the divergence between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates, indicating that pricing actions affected how volume metrics aligned across bottling partners. At PG, higher pricing contributed 3% to the growth in Health Care net sales, while also offsetting volume declines in Oral Care, particularly in regions like Greater China and Europe. For PM, price increases in Argentina and Canada were noted as counterproductive to market growth, with Canada's cigarette market declining 9.3% due in part to the impact of higher prices and substitution toward e-vapor products. Synthesizing these perspectives reveals that while pricing actions were used strategically to boost revenue, they had mixed effects on volume and market share depending on regional dynamics and category-specific consumer sensitivity.",

          "chunk_text": "a third party. We typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.\n\nWe generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn 2021, the Company acquired the remaining ownership interest in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC ('BodyArmor'). The impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment.\n\nIn 2020, the Company discontinued our Odwalla juice business. The impact of discontinuing our Odwalla juice business has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eightounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa nonready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

Philip Morris (PM) reports pension-related other assets at $294 million in 2023, a decline from $410 million in 2022, indicating a reduction in the value of pension assets. Target (TGT) shows a pension asset of $57 million in 2023, down from $75 million in 2022, reflecting a similar trend of declining pension asset values. These figures suggest varying degrees of pension-related financial exposure, with PM showing the most significant drop in pension assets year-over-year, and CL incorporating pension enhancements directly into its employee-related charges.",

PepsiCo (PEP) reflects 'Other, net' as a minor negative adjustment in its effective tax rate calculation, at (0.5)% in both 2021 and 2020, and (0.6)% in 2019, indicating small but consistent tax-related impacts. These differences suggest that while all three companies disclose 'Other, net' items, they do so in different financial contexts\u2014CL in restructuring and asset write-offs, MO in financing outflows, and PEP in tax adjustments\u2014highlighting varied approaches to managing non-operational financial elements.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) explicitly states it has no off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities and actively manages foreign currency, interest rate, and commodity price exposures using derivatives, with a prohibition on speculative use. Costco (COST) asserts that it has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial condition, though it discloses extensive financing activities including dividend payments, debt repayments, and international guaranteed notes. Procter & Gamble (PG) confirms it has no off-balance sheet financing arrangements with material impact and notes that while it has supplier and customer loan guarantees, these are not material. Collectively, all three companies downplay the materiality of off-balance sheet exposures, but differ in the level of detail and emphasis on risk mitigation strategies, with CL providing the most detailed discussion of hedging practices.",

PepsiCo, in contrast, has long-dated debt maturities, with key issuances maturing in 2031 ($1.25 billion at 1.950%), 2033 ($1 billion at 0.750%), 2041 ($750 million at 2.625%), and as far out as 2051 ($1 billion at 2.750%), reflecting a long-term capital structure approach.

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include interest rate swap contracts, forward-starting interest rate swaps, foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and these swaps are classified as follows:\n\n- Level 1: Based upon quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2: Based upon observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n- Level 3: Based upon unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forwardstarting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive recorded an actuarial gain of $398 million in 2022 (recognized in 2023) due to a domestic postretirement plan amendment and a higher discount rate. Coca-Cola experienced a net actuarial gain of $1,231 million in 2022 (recognized in 2023) primarily from an increase in the discount rate for its U.S. qualified pension plan, while it recorded a $129 million actuarial loss in 2023 due to a decrease in the discount rate. Target reported an actuarial loss of $114 million in 2023 for its qualified pension plans, contrasting with a $612 million gain in 2022. These differences suggest that while Colgate and Coca-Cola benefited from actuarial gains in recent years, largely driven by discount rate changes and plan amendments, Target has seen a reversal in this trend in 2023, indicating a more challenging year for its pension obligations.",

PepsiCo (PEP) discusses a prior service cost/(credit) amortization policy tied to plan participant demographics, specifically mentioning the amortization of prior service credits over the average remaining service life for hourly participants (~11 years) and life expectancy for retirees (~26 years). Procter & Gamble (PG) reports a prior service cost of $140 million for pension benefits and a prior service credit of $(655) million for other retiree benefits, showing a contrasting mix of cost and credit across its benefit categories.

See Note 13 for further inform ation.\n\nIn  2020,  we  adopted  an  am endm ent  to  the  U.S.  qualified  defined  benefit  plans  to  freeze  benefit  accruals  for  salaried  participants,  effective December 31, 2025.\n\nGains and losses resulting from  actual experience differing from  our assum ptions, including the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assum ptions, are determ ined at each m easurem ent date. These differences are recognized as a com ponent of net gain or loss in accum ulated other com prehensive loss within com m on shareholders' equity . If this net accum ulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the m arket-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/incom e for the following year based upon the average rem aining service life for participants in PepsiCo Em ployees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H) (approxim ately  11 years) and retiree m edical (approxim ately 11 years), and the rem aining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approxim ately 26 years).\n\nThe cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior em ployee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree m edical benefits (expense)/incom e on a straight-line basis over the average rem aining service life for participants in Plan H, and the rem aining life expectancy for participants in Plan I, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the benefit accruals freeze effective Decem ber 31, 2025 is am ortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze.",

      "answer": "COST notes that higher consumer debt levels, along with inflation and unemployment, could adversely affect demand for its products and require changes in product mix or pricing strategies. MO highlights that rising consumer debt is placing discretionary income pressure on adult tobacco consumers, influencing purchasing behaviors such as brand mix and adoption of smoke-free products. WMT states that consumer debt levels, alongside disposable income and credit availability, are key factors influencing buying patterns and sales performance. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies are impacted by consumer debt, they are adapting through pricing discipline (COST), product innovation and smoke-free transitions (MO), and omni-channel growth and value orientation (WMT).",

See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  At  the  end  of  2021,  the  potential  change  in  fair  value  of  commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance.

      "answer": "PepsiCo experienced a significant decrease in settlement charges in 2021, which contributed to a $405 million increase in other pension and retiree medical benefits income. This reduction was driven by lower charges related to the pandemic, fixed income gains, and prior plan changes. Philip Morris disclosed settlement and curtailment charges primarily linked to employee severance and early retirement programs, indicating a strategic workforce restructuring effort. In contrast, Target reported no settlement charges in 2021, with only $1 million each in 2020 and 2019, suggesting a more stable pension liability position. Together, these differences show varied corporate strategies in managing pension obligations, with PEP benefiting from reduced charges, PM actively restructuring its workforce, and TGT maintaining minimal settlement activity.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWhen deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The cash flow impact of the Company's derivative instruments is primarily included in our consolidated statement of cash flows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer to Note 5.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances. We are the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the right to control the asset. Operating lease right-of-use ('ROU') assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statement of income. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When our contracts contain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components as a single lease component. Refer to Note 9.\n\nWe have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following ranges: buildings and improvements: 40 years or less; and machinery and equipment: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense of assets under finance leases, totaled $1,262 million, $1,301 million and $1,208 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements totaled $15 million, $18 million and $18 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.",

          "chunk_text": "\nAmounts include cash and cash equivalents in our solvency capital portfolio, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 4. 1\n\nAmounts include cash and cash equivalents related to assets held for sale, which are included in the line item prepaid ex penses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2. 2\n\n## Investments\n\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year as short-term investments.\n\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis. Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on our policy for investments, which includes our assessment of impairments.\n\nWe invest in limited partnerships that receive tax credits and other tax  benefits by constructing, owning and operating alternative energy generation facilities. Investments of this nature are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We generate a return through the receipt of tax credits, other tax  benefits and cash distributions. We have elected to apply the proportional amortization method ('PAM') of accounting to these investments. In accordance with PAM accounting, the Company amortizes the cost of its investments in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income based on the proportion of the income tax benefits received during the period to the total income tax benefits ex pected to be received over the life of the investments. The income tax credits and other income tax benefits earned reduce our income tax payments and are recorded in the line item net change in operating assets and liabilities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Refer to Note 15 for additional information on these investments.\n\n## Trade Accounts Receivable\n\nWe record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any expected loss on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on available relevant information, in addition to historical loss information, the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and the economic status of, our bottling partners and customers. We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.\n\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $21,873 million and $17,704 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $114 million and $83 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company accounts for this program as a sale, and accordingly, the trade receivables sold are excluded from the line item trade accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories consist primarily of raw materials and packaging (which include ingredients and supplies) and finished goods (which include concentrates and syrups in our concentrate operations and finished beverages in our finished product",

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive, Mondel\u0113z International, and Altria Group compare in their 2023 reporting of total current liabilities, and what does this reveal about their short-term financial obligations relative to their respective balance sheet structures?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reported total current liabilities of $4,741 million, Mondel\u0113z International reported $19,013 million, and Altria Group reported $6,256 million in 2023. These figures reflect the differing scale and operational complexity of each company. Colgate maintains a relatively balanced current asset-to-liability ratio (1.11), Mondel\u0113z shows a tighter liquidity position (0.62), and Altria exhibits a slightly healthier ratio (0.65) despite its smaller current liability base. These differences suggest varying approaches to managing short-term obligations within their broader capital structures.",

      "answer": "Costco (COST) declared cash dividends totaling $1.498 billion, which significantly reduced retained earnings, while maintaining strong equity growth through net income and stock-based compensation. Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ) declared $1.867 billion in dividends, reflecting a consistent increase in per-share payout from $1.09 to $1.33 over recent years, and reducing retained earnings despite strong net earnings. Altria (MO) declared $6.49 billion in dividends, a substantial portion of its retained earnings, contributing to a decline in total equity. While all three companies prioritize shareholder returns through dividends, Costco and Mondel\u0113z maintain more balanced equity strategies, whereas Altria's dividend payout places greater pressure on retained earnings.",

      "answer": "COST reported net receivables of $2,721 million as of September 1, 2024, showing a relatively modest increase from the prior year, suggesting a stable credit policy. KO disclosed $1,527 million in net receivables due from equity method investees as of December 31, 2023, indicating a significant portion of its receivables are tied to joint ventures or affiliated entities. WMT stated that its net receivables from customer transactions were $3.7 billion as of January 31, 2024, reflecting a broader customer-facing credit exposure. Together, these figures reveal differing credit risk profiles: COST maintains a conservative approach, KO's exposure is largely intercompany-related, and WMT has a larger direct customer credit footprint.",

      "answer": "KO has systematically managed administration costs through its long-running Productivity and Reinvestment Program, incurring $4,426 million in pretax expenses since 2012, primarily aimed at simplifying and standardizing the organization. MO's administration costs in the oral tobacco segment reached $1,327 million in 2024, indicating a significant investment in administrative infrastructure for this growing segment. PM, in contrast, highlights rising administration and research costs as a headwind to operating income growth, despite strong revenue performance, suggesting a more aggressive reinvestment strategy that may be dilutive in the short term. Comparing these figures reveals differing approaches: KO focuses on long-term structural efficiency, MO allocates significant administrative resources to support segment growth, and PM appears to be increasing administrative spending despite profitability pressures, indicating varying philosophies on cost control effectiveness.",

While most of the initiatives included in this program were substantially completed by the end of 2024, certain initiatives, which are primarily designed to further simplify and standardize our organization, have been delayed and will be completed during 2025.\n\nThe Company has incurred total pretax expenses of $4,426 million related to our productivity and reinvestment program since it commenced. These expenses were recorded in the line items other operating charges and other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statements of income.

Procter & Gamble (PG) estimated $180 million in discretionary contributions for defined benefit retirement plans in fiscal 2025, indicating a forward-looking approach to long-term liabilities while balancing business investment opportunities. Together, these approaches show KO focusing on global liquidity and reinvestment, MDLZ on growth and shareholder returns, and PG on long-term liability management.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola experienced rising commodity costs that partially offset gains from pricing initiatives and volume growth, particularly in North America, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. Mondelez noted that global inflation and macroeconomic pressures increased raw material and packaging costs, which it addressed through hedging, pricing actions, and cost control. Altria acknowledged ongoing commodity cost headwinds impacting its international investments, particularly Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI), and responded by monitoring conditions and developing alternative sourcing strategies. Together, these companies illustrate a mix of proactive cost management, pricing adjustments, and supply chain flexibility in response to rising commodity costs.",

        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Commodity Costs: KO reported that higher commodity costs partially offset operating income gains from pricing and volume growth in several regions, including North America and Latin America.",

      "answer": "Altria (MO) reports a Prior Service Cost (Credit) of $6 million for pensions and $(45)$ million for post-retirement benefits, indicating a net credit impact. PepsiCo (PEP) shows a Prior Service Cost (Credit) of $18 million for U.S. pensions and $(8)$ million for international pensions, reflecting a mixed impact across regions. Procter & Gamble (PG) reports a Prior Service Cost of $140 million for pension benefits, showing a growing obligation. These differences suggest varying pension adjustments\u2014MO reduced obligations in post-retirement benefits, PEP experienced both increases and decreases depending on geography, and PG faced an upward adjustment in pension liabilities.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Coca-Cola (KO) reported total operating lease liabilities of $1,362 million with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 7 years, Mondelez (MDLZ) had $702 million in total operating lease liabilities with a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.4 years, and Procter & Gamble (PG) disclosed $909 million in total operating lease liabilities with a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.0 years. These differences suggest varying approaches to leasing, with KO maintaining the highest lease liability and longest lease duration, potentially indicating a more capital-intensive or long-term leasing strategy compared to MDLZ and PG.",

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive, Coca-Cola, and Mondelez each approach the impact of price increases on their financial performance, and what do their disclosures reveal about the effectiveness of pricing strategies in mitigating input cost pressures in 2023?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive successfully leveraged price increases, particularly in Oral Care, to drive 9.5% net selling price growth in Europe, contributing to a 7.5% increase in net sales despite volume declines. Coca-Cola acknowledged that price increases were a key strategy to offset inflationary pressures on input costs, but warned that consumer sensitivity could lead to volume declines and negatively impact financial performance. Mondelez noted that while they attempted to raise prices to cover higher input and transportation costs, the effectiveness of these increases was limited by consumer resistance and the risk of lower sales volumes or customer delistings. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies used price increases to counter cost pressures, the effectiveness and risks associated with this strategy varied based on category dynamics and consumer behavior.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reported a 14% decrease in operating profit to $3,332 million in 2021, with the operating profit margin declining by 450 basis points to 19.1%, primarily driven by a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Coca-Cola highlighted that competitive pressures, supply chain disruptions, and shifts in the retail landscape\u2014including the rise of e-commerce\u2014posed significant risks to profitability, as they could constrain pricing power and increase marketing and distribution costs. PepsiCo noted that changes in pension and retiree medical cost accounting, specifically the service cost component, were reflected in operating profit, influenced by changes in discount rates and demographic assumptions. Together, these insights reveal that while Colgate faced internal margin pressures from gross profit contraction, Coca-Cola grappled with external market and competitive dynamics, and PepsiCo was impacted by accounting adjustments tied to long-term liabilities\u2014highlighting the diverse operational and financial challenges across the consumer staples sector in 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. The continuing evolution of the pandemic may also present risks not currently known to us.\n\n## Increased competition could hurt our business.\n\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. For additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, including the names of certain of our significant competitors, refer to the heading 'Competition' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of sales in the global market or in local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause the Company and our bottling partners to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers' ability to increase prices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost increases. Such pressures may also increase marketing costs along with in-store placement and slotting fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e-commerce may create additional consumer price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route-to-market strategies and thus negatively affect revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while we selectively expand into other profitable categories in the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.\n\n## If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.\n\nAchieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop, introduce and market new beverage products. The success of our innovation activities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends; obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines between, retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger retailers may seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system's profitability. In addition, in developed markets discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace, while in emerging and developing markets modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through ecommerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we and our bottling partners build e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail and foodservice customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\n\n## If we are unable to expand our operations in emerging and developing markets, our growth rate could be negatively affected.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Additionally, we rely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. Scarcity of, or heavy competition for, talented employee resources could impede our abilities in such markets. Moreover, the supply of our products in emerging and developing markets must match consumer demand for those products. Due to product price, limited purchasing power and cultural differences, our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or developing market.\n\n## If we do not successfully manage the possible negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement the most effective and efficient business model possible. Consequently, we continuously search for productivity opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take from time to time in pursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee morale which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and give rise to",

          "chunk_text": "## ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nGlobal E conomic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are G reater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and G ermany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments due to economic, political and social instabilities, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, foreign ex change and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2024.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the US dollar, which  have  negatively  impacted  net  sales,  net  earnings  and  cash  flows.  In  response  to  the  devaluation  of  foreign  currencies  (including  those  deemed  highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCommodities and  Supply  Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. V olatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution  operations  can  lead  to  increased  costs.  Legal  or  regulatory  requirements  and  sustainability  initiatives  may  result  in  increased  costs.  We  strive  to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response  to  certain  inflationary  or  cost  increases  may  also  offset  portions  of  the  cost  impacts;  however,  such  price  increases  may  negatively  impact  product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy'. G overnment controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.\n\nFor additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&amp;A), operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.\n\nFor most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG &amp;A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for ex ample, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&amp;A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in  SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased  advertising),  inflation,  foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.",

Significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the \"FCTC\"). Since it came into force in 2005, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco and nicotine-containing products to adult nicotine users. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions include:\n\n- restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell tobacco or nicotine-containing products;\n- the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;\n- restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;\n- the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;\n- restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and mandating plain packaging;\n- restrictions on packaging and cigarette formats and dimensions;\n- restrictions or bans on the display of product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on vending machines;\n- generation sales bans, under which the sale of certain tobacco or nicotine-containing products to people born after a certain year would be prohibited;\n- requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and/or other smoke or product constituents;\n- disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients, including bans on the flavors of certain tobacco and nicotine-containing products;\n- increased restrictions on smoking and use of tobacco and nicotine-containing products in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;\n- restrictions or prohibitions of novel tobacco or nicotine-containing products or related devices;\n- elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers;\n- restrictions in terms of importing or ex porting our products impacting our logistics activities and ability to ship our products;\n- encouraging litigation against tobacco companies; and\n- excluding tobacco companies from transparent public dialogue regarding public health and other policy matters.\n\nOur financial results could be materially affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands. More specifically, requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our SFPs, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\n## Changes in the earnings mix and changes in tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. Our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and div idends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls and other regulations.\n\nWe are subject to income tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the  base  erosion  and  profit  shifting  project  undertaken  by  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (the  \"OECD\"),  which  recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, and could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive disclosed that advertising costs are included in Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses and are expensed as incurred, with certain promotional programs reducing sales. Coca-Cola noted that competitive pressures may increase marketing costs along with in-store placement and other marketing fees, impacting profitability. Philip Morris International reported higher marketing, administration, and research costs, primarily due to inflationary impacts, notably related to wages, as a factor in its 2023 operating income decline. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies treat marketing costs as significant operational expenses, they face different pressures: CL focuses on accounting treatment, KO highlights competitive pressures, and PM points to inflationary cost increases.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reports $70 million in noncurrent assets related to retirement benefit plans in 2022, reflecting a modest long-term asset position tied to employee benefits. Coca-Cola, in contrast, reports significantly higher noncurrent assets of $72,064 million in 2022, indicating substantial long-term investments or holdings that support its global beverage infrastructure. Procter & Gamble shows $765 million in noncurrent assets for pension benefits and $4,525 million for other retiree benefits in 2022, highlighting a much larger asset-backed commitment to post-retirement obligations.

      "answer": "PepsiCo (PEP) emphasizes that although the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually, short-term asset returns do not significantly influence the evaluation of long-term rates. This suggests a stable and forward-looking investment strategy. Procter & Gamble (PG) reports an average expected return of 6.0% for pension plan assets and 8.5% for OPRB assets in 2024, indicating a more aggressive asset allocation for retiree medical assets. Target (TGT) reports a recent compound annual rate of return of 5.7% over 20 years on qualified plan assets, showing a more conservative and historically grounded approach. Together, these assumptions reflect differing strategic postures: PG appears to take on more risk for higher returns, PEP maintains a balanced view with less sensitivity to short-term volatility, and TGT leans on historical performance to guide expectations.",

See 'Other Consolidated Results' for further inform ation.\n\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further inform ation.\n\n## Pension and Retiree Medical Plans\n\nOur pension plans cover certain em ployees in the United States and certain international em ployees. Benefits are determ ined based on either years of service or a com bination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for m edical and life insurance benefits (retiree m edical) if they m eet age and service requirem ents. Generally , our share of retiree m edical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the rem ainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree m edical benefits.\n\nSee 'Items Affecting Comparability' and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statem ents for inform ation about changes and settlem ents within our pension plans.\n\n## Our Assumptions\n\nThe determination of pension and retiree m edical expenses and obligations requires the use of assum ptions to estim ate the am ount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree m edical expense am ounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by em ployees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of tim e (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated fi n an ci al  statem en ts, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.\n\nSignificant assum ptions used to m easure our annual pension and retiree m edical expenses include:\n\n- certain em ployee-related dem ographic factors, such as turnover, retirem ent age and m ortality;\n- the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans; and\n- the spot rates along the yield curve used to determ ine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities.\n\nCertain assumptions reflect our historical experience and m anagem ent's best judgm ent regarding future expectations. All actuarial assum ptions are reviewed annually ,  except  in  the  case  of  an  interim   rem easurem ent  due  to  a  significant  event  such  as  a  curtailm ent  or  settl em ent.  Due  to  the signifi cant m anagem ent judgm ent involved, these assum ptions could have a m aterial im pact on the m easurem ent of our pension and retiree m edical expenses and obligations.\n\nAt each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality , long-term  corporate debt securities with m aturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree m edical expense is based on the discount rates determ ined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely m atch the tim ing and am ount of our expected benefit paym ents and reflects the portfolio of investm ents we would consider to settle our liabilities.\n\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statem ents for inform ation about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans' investm ent strategy . Although we review our expected long-term  rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly i n f l u en ce ou r ev al u ati on  of  l on g -term  rates of  retu rn .",

          "chunk_text": "regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax  balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax  positions.\n\nRealization  of  net  operating  losses  and  other  carryforwards  is  dependent  upon  generating  sufficient  tax able  income  in  the  appropriate  jurisdiction  prior  to  the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.\n\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.\n\nA core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax  authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have several audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nBecause there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\nWe sponsor various postretirement benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other  assumptions  affect  the  annual  ex pense  and  net  obligations  recognized  for  the  underlying  plans.  Our  assumptions  reflect  our  historical  ex periences  and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in ex pense for the following year.  The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPRB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2024, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 6.0% and 8.5%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $145 million.\n\nSince pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 4.2% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $85 million. The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.8% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where most of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basispoint change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately $30 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPRB plans.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party  valuation  specialists  for  significant  goodwill  reporting  units  and  intangible  assets.  Determining  the  useful  life  of  an  intangible  asset  also  requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) emphasizes a prudent debt strategy, leveraging its global presence and strong capital position to borrow at low costs, while actively managing its mix of short- and long-term debt. Mondelez (MDLZ) highlights a reduction in total debt from $20.0 billion in 2020 to $19.5 billion in 2021, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.41, and outlines its use of long-term financing and strategic debt issuance to fund acquisitions like Chipita. Target (TGT), while not directly disclosing its debt levels, references EBIT and EBITDA as key metrics to assess operational efficiency, implicitly acknowledging the role of debt in its capital structure. Together, these perspectives reveal that KO and MDLZ actively manage and optimize their debt levels with clear disclosures on financing activities, while TGT focuses more on performance metrics that factor in debt without explicit commentary on debt strategy.",

We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our long-term debt was rated 'A+' by Standard &amp; Poor's and 'A1' by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated 'A-1' by Standard &amp; Poor's and 'P-1' by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.\n\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company.\n\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.",

We expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.\n\n## Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:\n\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher amounts of net long-term debt repayments, higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid in 2021 than in 2020. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020.\n\n## Chipita Acquisition\n\nOn January 3, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of Chipita S.A. The cash consideration for Chipita totaled \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) and we assumed and substantially paid down \u20ac0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita's debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately \u20ac1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Cash paid for the business was raised from cash from operations and by issuing long-term debt in the third quarter of 2021. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures , and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for additional details.\n\n## Supply Chain Financing\n\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers are from 30 to 180 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We also facilitate voluntary supply chain financing ('SCF') programs through several participating financial institutions. Under these programs, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine invoices that they want to sell to participating financial institutions. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in SCF programs has no bearing on our payment terms or amounts due. Our responsibility is limited to making payments based upon the agreed-upon contractual terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF programs and we have no economic interest in the suppliers' decision to participate in the SCF programs. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheet. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers that participate in the SCF programs are outstanding.\n\n## Guarantees:\n\nAs discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies , we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2021, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.\n\n## Debt:\n\nThe nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.\n\nRefer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for a projection of long-term debt scheduled to mature (including current maturities and finance leases) in future periods. In the next 12 months, we expect to repay approximately $1.7 billion of maturing long-term debt including: $1.2 billion in July 2022 and $0.5 billion in September 2022. We fund ongoing debt maturities and other long-term obligations using cash on hand or we may refinance obligations with longterm debt or short-term financing (such as our commercial paper borrowings) depending on financing available, timing considerations, flexibility to raise funding and the cost of financing.\n\nDuring December 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new $7.0 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior $6.0 billion authority. As of December 31, 2021, all $7.0 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available.\n\nOur total debt was $19.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $20.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Our debt-tocapitalization ratio was 0.41 at December 31, 2021 and 0.42 at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average term of",

MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes  to  Financial  Statements  (Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K).  This  section  generally  discusses  the  results  of operations for  2022  compared to 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition  for  2021  compared  to  2020  refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  our  fiscal  year  2021  Form  10-K,  which  was  filed  with  the  United  States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline,  pharmacy,  optical,  food  court,  hearing  aids,  and  tire  installation)  and  other  businesses  (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members  and  the  amount  they  spend  on  each  visit  (average  ticket).  Sales  comparisons  can  also  be  particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international  operations);  inflation  and  changes  in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions.  The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&amp;A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins  are  also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a  wide  range  of  global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or  reliably  predict  general  economic  health  or  changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term  on  maximizing  prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our members of our 'pricing authority' - consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlierthan-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost  increases  on  to  our  members.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  may  include  reducing  prices  on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).\n\nWe  believe  our  gasoline  business  enhances  traffic  in  our  warehouses,  but  it  generally  has  a  lower  gross  margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&amp;A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-",

Note  4  to  the  Financial Statements defines gift card \"breakage.\" We use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that  have  been  closed,  and  digital  acquisitions  that  we  no  longer  operate.  Comparable  sales  measures  vary  across  the  retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales, including shipment from stores to guests, store Order Pickup or Drive Up, and delivery via Shipt. Digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties.\n\nSales growth - from both comparable sales and new stores - represents an important driver of our long-term profitability. We expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth. We believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests' shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price, convenience, guest experience, and  other  factors  will  over  the  long-term  drive  both  increasing  shopping  frequency  (number  of  transactions,  or  \"traffic\")  and  the amount spent each visit (average transaction amount).\n\n",

V olatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. (1)\n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. For fiscal 2021, gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.\n\nMembership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

      "question": "How do PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, and Target differ in their treatment and strategic implications of share-based compensation expense, particularly in terms of allocation, recognition, and cash flow impact?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo allocates share-based compensation expense to its divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost, excluding the impact of changes in assumptions from market conditions, which are instead recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. Procter & Gamble recognizes share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of awards at the grant date, with expense recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period, and includes estimates for forfeitures based on historical data. Target reports a share-based compensation expense of $304 million in 2024, which is included in operating activities within the cash flow statement, showing a steady increase from $251 million in 2023 and $220 million in 2022. These differences highlight how each company integrates share-based compensation into performance evaluation and financial planning, with PepsiCo focusing on divisional accountability, P&G emphasizing valuation and forfeiture modeling, and Target reflecting a growing cash flow impact over time.",

The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any im pact of changes in our assum ptions during the year which reflect m arket conditions over which division m anagem ent has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.\n\n## Pension and Retiree Medical Expense\n\nPension and retiree m edical service costs m easured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determ ine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These com m odity derivatives include agricultural products, m etals, and energy . Com m odity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatm ent are m arked to m arket each period with the resulting gains and l osses  recorded  in  corporate  unallocated  expenses  as  either  cost  of  sales  or  selling,  general  and  adm inistrative  expenses,  depending  on  the underlying com m odity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the econom ic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting m ark-tomarket volatility , which rem ains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying com m odity price risk and were not entered i n to f or tradi n g  or specul ati v e pu rposes.\n\n## Net Revenue, Significant Expenses and Operating Profit/(Loss) by Division\n\nOur chief operating decision m aker (CODM) is our Chairm an and Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM uses division operating profit/(loss) as the profit m easure to evaluate division perform ance and allocate resources across divisions. Corporate unallocated expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/incom e and net interest expense and other are centrally m anaged costs and are therefore excluded from  this profit measure to provide better transparency of our division operating results. Our CODM considers variances of actual perform ance to our annual operating plan and periodic forecasts when m aking decisions.\n\nSignificant expenses are expenses which are regularly provided to the CODM and are included in division operating profit/(loss). These consist of segment  cost  of  sales,  segm ent  selling,  general  and  adm inistrative  expenses,  and  various  item s  affecting  com parability .  Segm ent  cost  of  sales i n cl u des raw m ateri al s, di rect l abor and pl ant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, i n specti on  costs  and  raw  m aterials  handling  faciliti es,  excl udi ng  the  i m pact  of  i tem s  aff ecti ng  com parabi l i ty .  Segm ent  sel l i ng,  general   and administrative expenses include the costs to execute sales to custom ers, distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain m erchandising activities, costs related to brand and product m arketing to consum ers, other ongoing operating costs that are not directly related to m anufacturing, distribution, selling, advertising or m arketing activities as well as other incom e or expense item s, excluding the i m pact  of   i tem s  af f ecti n g   com parabi l i ty .

(1)\n\nAn overview of preferred shares can be found in Note 8. (2)\n\n## NOTE 7\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company has two primary share-based compensation programs under which we annually grant stock option, restricted stock unit (RSU) and performance stock unit (PSU) awards to certain managers and directors.\n\nIn our main long-term incentive program, managers can elect to receive stock options or RSUs. All options vest after three years and have a 10-year life. Exercise prices on options are set equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of the grant. RSUs vest and settle in shares of common stock three years from the grant date.\n\nSenior-level executives participate in an additional long-term incentive program that awards PSUs, which are paid in shares after the end of a three-year performance period subject to pre-established performance goals. The program includes a Relative Total Shareholder Return (R-TSR) modifier under which the number of shares ultimately granted is also impacted by the Company's actual shareholder return relative to our consumer products competitive peer set.\n\nIn addition to these long-term incentive programs, we award RSUs to the Company's non-employee directors and make other minor stock option and RSU grants to employees for which the terms are not substantially different from our long-term incentive awards.\n\nThe Company's share-based compensation plan was approved by shareholders in 2019. Under the 2019 plan, a maximum of 150 million shares of common stock was authorized for issuance and a total of 77 million shares remain available for grant.\n\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant. The expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are recognized as compensation expense ratably from the grant date through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and/or is no longer required to provide services to earn the award. Sharebased compensation expense is included as part of Cost of products sold and SG&amp;A in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and includes an estimate of forfeitures, which is based on historical data.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the \"Plan\"), as subsequently amended and restated, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.\n\nThe Plan's award types are summarized as follows:\n\n- Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2020, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25% each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50% of restricted stock units generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% were vested five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 3.8%, 4.4% and 4.9%, respectively.\n- Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and generally range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 4.2%, 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the Plan, Flipkart has certain share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued. Share-based compensation expense associated with these plans is included in the Other line in the table above.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) highlights that excise taxes on sweetened beverages could negatively affect its business, with past U.S. legislative proposals targeting sugary drinks. Altria (MO) reports that tobacco products are subject to substantial and increasing excise taxes, with cigarette taxes alone rising from $0.36 to $1.93 per pack since 1998, and anticipates further adverse impacts from e-vapor and oral nicotine tax increases. Philip Morris (PM) includes excise taxes in its net revenue reporting for combustible and smoke-free products, indicating that these taxes are a direct cost component of their financial disclosures. Together, these perspectives reveal that excise taxes are a significant and growing cost burden across different consumer staple categories\u2014beverages, traditional tobacco, and emerging nicotine products\u2014each facing distinct regulatory and tax policy pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "## RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERS\n\n## Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or regulations, or unfavorable resolutions of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax  rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, tax  treaties between such jurisdictions, and the geographic mix  of our income before income tax es, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix or foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our net income. Tax laws and regulations, including rates of taxation, are subject to revisions by individual taxing jurisdictions, and such revisions may result from multilateral agreements.\n\nMany jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's ('OECD') AntiBase Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a two-pillared project on behalf of the G20 and other participating countries which would grant additional tax ing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. Pillar One would allow countries to reallocate a portion of profits earned by multinational businesses with an annual global revenue exceeding \u20ac20 billion and a profit margin of over 10% to applicable market jurisdictions. While the OECD issued draft language for the international implementation of Pillar One in October 2023, both the substantive rules and implementation process remain under discussion at the OECD so the timetable for any implementation remains uncertain.\n\nIn December 2021, the OECD issued Pillar Two model rules which would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15%, and the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate similar provisions into their respective domestic laws. The directive requires, with certain limited ex ceptions, the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023. Numerous countries have enacted legislation that implemented certain aspects of Pillar Two effective January 1, 2024, while many others have indicated their intent to adopt, or have adopted, legislation effective in 2025. The OECD and implementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance.\n\nThe Company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate. To the extent additional legislative changes take place in the countries in which we operate, it is possible that these changes may increase uncertainty and have a material impact on our net income and cash flow. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax  audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax  provisions, estimates and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for which the statute of limitations is open.\n\nFor instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income for tax years 2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a potential additional U.S. federal income tax  liability of approx imately $3.3 billion for that period, plus interest. The Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and is pursuing, and will continue to pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its positions. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court ('Tax Court') issued an opinion ('Opinion') predominantly siding with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion (together with the original Tax Court opinion, 'Opinions') also siding with the IRS as to the validity of the blocked-income regulations and their application to the Brazilian legal restrictions. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the Opinions and intends to vigorously defend its positions, considering all avenues of appeal, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Company's favor. It is therefore possible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinions could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would be subject to significant additional liabilities for the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years if the unfavorable portions of the Opinions were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope of the Opinions. Moreover, the IRS could successfully appeal the portions of the Opinions that are favorable to the Company and/or assert new claims for additional tax  relating to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees. These adjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any such adjustments related to years prior to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may also have an impact on the transition tax  payable as part of the 2017 Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act ('Tax  Reform Act'). For additional information regarding the tax litigation, refer to Part I, 'Item 3. Legal Proceedings' of this report.\n\n## Increased or new indirect taxes could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income, sometimes referred to as 'indirect taxes,' including import duties, tariffs, ex cise tax es, sales or value-added tax es, tax es on sweetened or aerated beverages, packaging tax es, carbon tax es, property tax es and payroll tax es, in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, in the past, the U.S. Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax  on beverages sweetened with sugar, HFCS or other",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nregulatory requirements, even inadvertently, and FDA enforcement actions also could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n- Investigation and E nforcement: The FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it, including document requests and other required information submissions, facility inspections, facility closures, ex aminations and investigations, injunction proceedings, monetary penalties, product withdrawal and recall orders, and product seizures. Investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Excise Taxes\n\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States. The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of executive and legislative bodies.\n\nFederal, state and local cigarette ex cise tax es have increased substantially over the past two decades, far outpacing the rate of inflation. Between the end of 1998 and February 24, 2025, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax increased from $0.36 to $1.93 per pack. Three states (Maryland, Colorado and Rhode Island) increased excise taxes in 2024. As of February 24, 2025, no states have increased excise taxes in 2025. However, various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.\n\nA majority of states currently tax  MST using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight. We support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on MST to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax. As of February 24, 2025, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for MST. North Carolina has passed legislation that will cause the state to adopt a weight-based tax methodology for MST in July 2025.\n\nAn increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches. As of February 24, 2025, 33 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax e-vapor products. These taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the e-vapor product form. Similarly, 13 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our operating companies' products through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult tobacco consumer purchases from premium to non-premium or discount cigarettes, to lower taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. Lower sales volume and reported share performance of our operating companies' products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, substantial ex cise tax  increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine products may negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## International Treaty on Tobacco Control\n\nThe World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the 'FCTC') entered into force in February 2005. As of February 24, 2025, 182 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC. While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the U.S. Senate. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobacco-related issues.\n\nThere are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any FCTC actions on legislation or regulation in the United States, either indirectly or as a result of the United States becoming a party to the FCTC, or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence FDA regulation and enforcement.\n\n## State Settlement Agreements\n\nAs discussed in Note 20, during 1997 and 1998, PM USA and other major domestic cigarette manufacturers entered into the State Settlement Agreements. These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2024, the inflation calculation was approximately 2.9% based on the latest CPI-U data. We will continue to monitor the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment and our businesses.",

For a breakdown of asset impairment, exit and implementation costs by segment, see Note 5. Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs.\n\nIn addition, in 2021 the comparability of OCI was further impacted by the following disposition and acquisition-related costs:\n\nSte. Michelle Transaction: For the year ended December 31, 2021, net pre-tax disposition-related costs of $51 million were recorded in the wine segment, which consisted of a net pre-tax charge of $41 million to record the assets and liabilities associated with the Ste. Michelle Transaction at their fair value less costs to sell and $10 million of other disposition-related costs. The total net pre-tax charges of $51 million were recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\nAcquisition-Related Costs : For the year ended December 31, 2021, Altria recorded pre-tax acquisition-related costs of $37 million in the oral tobacco products segment primarily for the settlement of an arbitration related to the 2019 on! transaction. These costs were included in marketing, administration and research costs in Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n- PMCC Residual Value Adjustments: For the year ended December 31, 2020, PMCC recorded pre-tax charges of $125 million (as a reduction to net revenues in the all other category) related to the decrease in unguaranteed residual values of certain leased assets. There were no such adjustments in 2021 or 2019.\n\n## Note 16. Benefit Plans\n\nSubsidiaries of Altria sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees of Altria and its subsidiaries. Employees hired on or after a date specific to their employee group, except for certain employees of UST's subsidiaries and Middleton, are not eligible to participate in these noncontributory defined benefit pension plans but are instead eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan with enhanced benefits. Altria and its subsidiaries also provide postretirement health care and other benefits to certain retired employees.\n\nThe plan assets and benefit obligations of Altria's pension plans and postretirement plans are measured at December 31 of each year.\n\nThe discount rates for Altria's plans were based on a yield curve developed from a model portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations.",

These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands  or  businesses,  impacts  from  various  financing  and investing  activities  and  other  impacts  related  to  employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting  policies  used  within  the  reportable  segments  to U.S.  GAAP.  The  most  notable  ongoing  reconciling  item  is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected  in  the  reportable  segments  to  the  overall  Company effective tax rate.\n\nCorporate  net  sales  increased  69%  to  $744  million  in  fiscal 2022  due  to  an  increase  in  the  net  sales  of  the  incidental businesses  managed  at  the  corporate  level.  Corporate  net earnings  improved  by  $872  million  to  $485  million  in  fiscal 2022  due  primarily  to  the  prior  year  loss  on  the  early  debt extinguishment,  a  current  year  gain  on  the  divestiture  of  a minor  business,  net  sales  growth,  current  year  tax  benefits (primarily higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation) and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by  increased  commodity  costs  tied  to  the  aforementioned incidental businesses.\n\n## Restructuring  Program  to  Deliver  Productivity  and  Cost Savings\n\nThe  Company  has  historically  had  an  ongoing  restructuring program with  annual  spending  in  the  range  of  $250  to  $500 million. Savings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In fiscal 2022, the Company incurred before tax restructuring  costs  within  the  range  of  our  historical  annual ongoing level of $250 to $500 million.\n\nRestructuring accruals of $147 million as of June 30, 2022, are classified  as  current  liabilities.  Approximately  65%  of  the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2022 either have been or  will  be  settled  with  cash.  Consistent  with  our  historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges  are  funded  by  and  included  within  Corporate  for segment reporting.\n\nIn addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing  savings  efforts  in  our  supply  chain,  marketing  and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.\n\n## CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nWe  believe  our  financial  condition  continues  to  be  of  high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from  operations  and  to  readily  access  capital  markets  at competitive rates.\n\nOperating  cash  flow  provides  the  primary  source  of  cash  to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating  cash  is  used  first  to  fund  shareholder  dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position  of  the  Company  reflects  our  strong  business  results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.\n\n## Cash Flow Analysis\n\n",

Under the non-servicing arrangements, PMI does not provide any administrative support or servicing after the trade receivables have been sold to the unaffiliated financial institutions.\n\nCumulative trade receivables sold, including excise taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, were $11.8 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively. PMI's operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets, which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions. The trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were $0.9 billion, $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the sum of the cash received is recorded as a loss on sale of trade  receivables  within  marketing,  administration  and  research  costs  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings.  For  the  years  ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 the loss on sale of trade receivables was immaterial.\n\n## Note 19.\n\n## Asset Impairment and Exit Costs:\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, PMI recorded total pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $216 million, $149 million and $422 million, respectively. The total pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs were included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## South Korea\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, PM Korea commenced the implementation of a new business operating model, which requires the restructuring of its current distribution agreements. As a result, PMI recorded exit costs of $57 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, related to contract terminations and restructuring with certain distributors.\n\n## Organizational Design Optimization\n\nAs part of PMI's transformation to a smoke-free future, PMI seeks to optimize its organizational design, which includes the elimination, relocation  and  outsourcing  of  certain  operations  center  and  centralized  activities.  In  January  2020,  PMI  commenced  a  multi-phase restructuring project in Switzerland. PMI initiated the employee consultation procedures, as required under Swiss law, for the impacted employees. The consultation procedures for the first two phases were completed in 2020 with the final phases initiated and completed in 2021.  Additionally,  since  the  commencement  of  this  multi-phase  restructuring  project  in  2020,  PMI  launched  a  voluntary  separation program in Switzerland for certain eligible employees and announced the outsourcing of certain activities in Argentina, Indonesia, Poland and the United States. This multi-phase restructuring project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, PMI recorded pre-tax charges of $159 million and $149 million, respectively, related to the  organizational  design  optimization.  Since  inception  of  this  multi-phase  restructuring  project  in  January  2020  through  December  31, 2021,  approximately  1,020  positions  in  total  were  impacted,  resulting  in  cumulative  pre-tax  charges  of  $308  million  related  to  the organizational design optimization program. Of this cumulative pre-tax amount, $300 million related to separation program charges and $8 million related to asset impairment charges.\n\n## Global Manufacturing Infrastructure Optimization\n\nIn  light  of  declining  PMI  cigarette  volumes  resulting  from  lower  total  industry  volumes  and  the  shift  to  smoke-free  alternatives,  PMI continues to optimize its global manufacturing infrastructure. During 2019, PMI recorded asset impairment and exit costs related to plant closures in Argentina, Colombia, Germany and Pakistan as part of its global manufacturing infrastructure optimization.\n\n## Germany\n\nOn November 4, 2019, PMI announced that, as part of its global manufacturing infrastructure optimization, its German affiliate, Philip Morris Manufacturing GmbH (\"PMMG\"), reached an agreement with employee representatives to end cigarette production in its factory in Berlin, Germany, by January 1, 2020. As a result of this agreement, during 2019, PMI recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $342 million in the European Union segment. This amount included pension and employee separation costs of $251 million, which are paid in cash, and asset impairment costs of $91 million, primarily related to machinery and equipment, which were non-cash charges.",

          "chunk_text": "## Financial and Economic Risks\n\n## Uncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\n\nUncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Unfavorable global economic conditions, such as a recession, an economic slowdown, inflation, higher interest rates and/or reduced category growth rates, including as a result of the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, have negatively impacted and/or could negatively impact our business and result in declining revenues, profitability and/or cash flows. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, during periods of economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions, consumers may have less consumer confidence, reduce consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to 'private label,' or lower-priced product offerings. These changes could reduce demand for our products or result in a shift in our product mix, as consumers may choose products that sell at lower prices. Additionally, our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins. Furthermore, economic conditions can cause our customers, suppliers, distributors, contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to buy our products or provide us with or distribute finished product, raw and packaging materials and/or services in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we could face difficulty collecting or recovering accounts receivables from third parties facing financial or operational difficulties, including bankruptcies.\n\n## Disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.\n\nWhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption or volatility in the credit markets, interest rate increases or changes to our credit rating could negatively impact the availability or further increase the cost of funding. Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper programs or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate, foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate, foreign currency or commodity price exposures. In addition, tighter or more volatile credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could negatively impact our business.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we do business. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change. Changes in the mix of our earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in tax rates, changes in tax  laws, including how ex isting tax  laws are interpreted or enforced, or contemplated changes in long-standing tax  principles, if finalized and adopted, could adversely impact our future effective tax  rate and business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For ex ample, long-standing international tax  norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax  cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of a multilateral project, the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (the 'BEPS Project'), that has established new principles and reporting requirements recommended by the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the 'OECD'). In connection with the BEPS Project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities and the public on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in countries outside of the U.S. Many jurisdictions have already enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the BEPS Project. The OECD is also addressing the challenges of the digitization of the global economy with plans to redefine jurisdictional taxation rights in market countries and establish a global minimum tax. The European Union has established the Minimum Tax Directive ('Pillar II') that provides for a minimum level of taxation for certain large corporations in every jurisdiction in which they operate. In addition, many other jurisdictions outside of the European Union have also implemented a similar minimum tax regime consistent with the policy of Pillar II. Detailed",

Additionally, these and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient sales, income and cash flow , it could affect the Company's ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments.\n\n## Changing political and geopolitical conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results.\n\nChanges in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, as well as changing geopolitical conditions, may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. Results of elections, referendums, sanctions or other political processes and pressures in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, tariffs, import and ex port controls and the general movement of goods, materials, services, capital, data and people between countries. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, new or increased tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe Company operates a global business with sales, manufacturing, distribution and research and development organizations globally that contribute to our overall growth. If geopolitical tensions and trade controls were to increase or disrupt our business in markets where we have significant sales or operations, including disruptions due to governmental responses to such conflicts (such as the imposition of sanctions, export controls, retaliatory tariffs, increased business licensing requirements or limitations on profits), such disruptions could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nOur  business,  operations  or  employees  have  been  and  could  continue  to  be  adversely  affected  (including  by  the  need  to  de-consolidate  or  even  ex it  certain businesses in particular countries) by geopolitical conflicts, political volatility, trade controls, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions. This could include political instability, upheaval or acts of war and the related responses of governments or other entities (including, but not limited  to,  boycotts  in  certain  regions),  broad  economic  instability  or  sovereign  risk  related  to  a  default  by  or  deterioration  in  the  creditworthiness  of  local governments, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nFor example, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted, and the situation it generates may continue to negatively impact, our operations. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the overall situation will evolve. We may reduce  further  or  discontinue  our  operations  in  Russia  due  to  sanctions  and  ex port  controls  and  counter-sanctions,  monetary,  currency  or  payment  controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions, supply and transportation challenges or other circumstances and considerations. Ultimately, these could result in loss of assets or impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.\n\nMore broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation worsen, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures, energy and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe.\n\nChanges in geopolitical conditions could also amplify or affect the other risk factors set forth in this Part I, Item 1A, including, but not limited to, foreign ex change volatility,  disruptions to the financial and credit markets, energy supply and supply chain disruptions, increased risks of an information security or operational technology incident, cost fluctuations and commodity cost increases and increased costs to ensure compliance with global and local laws and regulations.\n\n## Disruptions in credit markets or to our banking partners or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit or overall liquidity.\n\nA disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, we rely on top-tier banking partners in key markets around the world, who themselves face economic, societal, political and other risks, for access to credit and to facilitate collection, payment and supply chain finance programs. A disruption to one or more of these top-tier partners could impact our ability to draw on existing credit facilities or otherwise adversely affect our cash flows or the cash flows of our customers and vendors.\n\n## BUSINESS OPERATIONS RISKS\n\n## Our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain.\n\nOur ability  to  meet  our  customers'  needs  and  achieve  cost  targets  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  key  manufacturing  and  supply  arrangements,  including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes or controversies, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity or disruptions in our internal information",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reports that Hill's Pet Nutrition saw a 5.0% volume growth in 2023, which contributed to a 15.5% increase in net sales, although operating profit declined due to higher raw material costs and unfavorable mix effects. Coca-Cola (KO) notes that volume growth was a key driver behind a 10.3% increase in net sales to equity method investees in 2023, indicating a strong link between volume and performance in its international bottling partnerships. Philip Morris (PM) identifies changes in product volume growth rates as one of several factors that could trigger asset impairments, signaling that sustained volume trends directly influence its asset valuations and long-term financial health. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are sensitive to volume dynamics, the financial implications vary\u2014CL experiences volume-driven top-line growth but margin pressure, KO benefits from volume expansion through its investees, and PM faces potential impairment risks if volume growth slows.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Executive Overview\n\n## Business Organization\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, 'we,' 'us' 'our' the 'Company' or 'Colgate') is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as to provide Colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. We do this by developing and selling products globally that make people's and their pets' lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and DE&amp;I strategies across our organization.\n\nWe are tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.\n\nOperationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. We compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. Approximately 70% of our Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of our Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.\n\nThe Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and eCommerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors. Through Hill's Pet Nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. We also sell certain of our products direct-to-consumer. We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. In addition, we review market share and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. The monitoring of these indicators and our Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the Company's use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' and 'Market Share Information' below.",

See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  At  the  end  of  2021,  the  potential  change  in  fair  value  of  commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola, Altria, and Target differ in their treatment of settlement charges as liabilities, and what does this suggest about their respective financial risk profiles in managing long-term obligations?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola's settlement charges were linked to strategic realignment initiatives, indicating a proactive approach to restructuring liabilities as part of broader operational changes. Altria reported $3.349 billion in settlement charges in 2021, a significant liability that remained relatively stable compared to 2020, suggesting ongoing exposure to legal or regulatory settlements. Target, in contrast, had negligible settlement charges\u2014only $1 million in 2020 and none in 2021\u2014indicating minimal impact from such liabilities. This contrast suggests that Altria faces higher financial risk from settlement obligations compared to Coca-Cola and Target, which either have fewer such liabilities or manage them differently as part of their risk profile.",

Refer to Note 13 and Note 18. 2\n\n## NOTE 16: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n\n- Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. We value assets and liabilities included in this level using dealer and broker quotations, certain pricing models, bid prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n- Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.",

These items were $64, $46 and $84 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to gov ernment agencies and member returns. The Company reserv es for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recov ery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectiv ely, in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods.  The  Company also prov ides  expanded  products  and  serv ices  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  T he  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its transactions and recognizes rev enue on a gross basis.  The  Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or serv ice before it is transferred to the member. The majority of rev enue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Rev enue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, rev enue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  rev enue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  ov er  the  one-year  membership  period.  Deferred membership fees at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $2,501 and $2,337.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executiv e members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum v alue, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of nonredemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the net reduction in sales was $2,804, $2,576, and $2,307.\n\nThe Company sells and otherwise prov ides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for  outstanding  shop  card  balances  as  a  shop  card  liability,  net  of  estimated  breakage.  Shop  card  liabilities  are  included  in  other  current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCitibank, N.A. is the exclusiv e issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receiv es v arious forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receiv e, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries.\n\n## Merchandise Costs\n\nMerchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inv entory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company's depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, and are reduced by v endor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNOTE 1\n\n## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter &amp; Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior  quality  and  value.  Our  products  are  sold  in  about 180  countries  and  territories  primarily  through  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  consumers.  We  have  on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.\n\n## Use of E stimates\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items,  consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax  positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although  management  does  not  generally  believe  such  differences  would  materially  affect  the  financial  statements  in  any  individual  year.  However,  regarding ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer.\n\nTrade  promotions,  consisting  primarily  of  customer  pricing  allowances,  merchandising  funds  and  consumer  coupons,  are  offered  through  various  programs  to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative E xpense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG &amp;A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include television, print, radio, digital and in-store advertising ex penses and were $9.6 billion in 2024, $8.0 billion in 2023 and $7.9 billion in 2022. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SG&amp;A include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.\n\n## Other Non-Operating Income, Net\n\nOther non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, net non-service impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income, accumulated foreign currency translation losses and other non-operating items.\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherw ise specified.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  are  provided  on  all  earnings  for  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States. These  provisions,  as  well  as  state  and  local  income  tax   provisions,  are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the  provision  for  income  tax es  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings. PMI  recognizes  income  tax es  associated  with  G lobal  Intangible  Low-Tax ed  Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\n\n## Leases\n\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange  for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the  lease  term. Lease ex pense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item. At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases. The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be ex ercised. Certain of PMI's leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage. These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs. PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Marketing costs\n\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, instore display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives. Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are ex pensed as incurred. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods. PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer's receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI's right to payment for those products and the customer's ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI's performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\n\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer. PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract. The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  PMI is a principal for majority of its arrangements and recognizes revenue at the transaction price, with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories  evolve. For arrangements where PMI acts as an agent, the net commission earned is recognized as revenue. PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.",

Philip Morris uses a five-year comparison starting from December 31, 2018, measuring against its own Peer Group and the S&P 500 Index, with a focus on quarterly dividend reinvestment. Target assesses cumulative total shareholder return over the last five fiscal years, starting from February 2, 2019, and compares performance against both a Previous Peer Group of 19 retailers and a Current Peer Group that includes BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc., weighted by market capitalization.

KO's effective tax rate increased from 16.7% in 2019 to 21.1% in 2021, influenced by differences in earnings across jurisdictions and other adjustments. PM's effective tax rate remained fairly flat at 21.8% in 2021, with slight fluctuations driven by foreign rate differences and global intangible low-taxed income impacts.

Costco emphasizes its conservative financial approach, mentioning short-term borrowings, commercial paper programs, and guarantees, while stating that off-balance sheet arrangements are not material. Philip Morris notes no off-balance sheet arrangements other than guarantees and purchase obligations totaling $3.7 billion in 2024, and details its debt structure and maturity profile.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) continues to invest behind its brands through advertising, while also seeking to reduce advertising and promotional material costs through funding-the-growth initiatives. PepsiCo (PEP) emphasizes the importance of advertising, marketing, and promotional activity as key competitive factors and notes the risk of being outspent or outperformed by competitors in digital marketing. Philip Morris International (PM) highlights that its ability to differentiate products and communicate with adult consumers is constrained by regulations that restrict advertising and dissemination of truthful product information. Synthesizing these perspectives reveals that while all three companies view advertising as critical, CL is balancing investment with cost reduction, PEP faces digital marketing pressures from competitors, and PM operates under significant regulatory limitations on brand communication.",

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, risks related to the impact of the war in Ukraine, including increases in the costs and, in certain cases, limitations on the availability of certain raw and packaging materials and commodities (including oil and natural gas), supply chain and logistics challenges, import restrictions, foreign currency volatility and reputational concerns. We also have faced and continue to face challenges to our ability to repatriate cash from Russia and identify banking partners to support our Russian operations and we may face challenges to our ability to protect our assets in Russia. We also continue to monitor the impact of sanctions, export controls and import restrictions imposed generally and in response to the war in Ukraine.\n\n## The Conflict in the Middle East\n\nThe conflict in the Middle East has not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Uncertainties and risks remain as to the duration of the conflict and its impact on geopolitical relations and stability in North Africa, the wider Middle East and nearby regions. The conflict has impacted and may continue to impact, among other things, supply chain and logistics, the availability and price of raw and packaging materials and commodities such as oil, consumer sentiment and consumption and category growth rates in the region.\n\nFor more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, refer to Part I, Item 1A 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Business Strategy\n\nTo achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on delivering consistent compounded earnings per share growth through driving organic sales growth, operational efficiencies and leveraging the strength of our balance sheet. We believe increased household penetration and improved brand health are the keys to consistent organic sales growth and aim to achieve these through science-led, core and premium innovation, pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments and expanding in faster-growing channels and markets. We aim to deliver margin expansion and cash flow growth through operating leverage and efficiency. We continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. We also seek to lead in the development of human capital and to maximize the impact of our Sustainability &amp; Social Impact Strategy. We are building and scaling our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, data, analytics and artificial intelligence, enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.\n\nThe investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect ex penses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification.\n\n## Significant Items Impacting Comparability\n\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we reassessed with our legal and tax advisers certain tax deductions taken in prior years by one of our subsidiaries and concluded that it was more likely than not that the deductions would not be sustained by the courts in that jurisdiction. The value of the tax deductions was not material to us in any year in which they were taken. The cumulative effect of the change in tax  position of $148 was reflected as a discrete item in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 income tax  ex pense, partially offset by the reversal of certain prior years' withholding tax  reserves of $22 that were no longer required (hereinafter referred to as the 'foreign tax  matter'). The tax  liability was paid in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. See Note 10, Income Tax es, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we recorded a charge of $267 as a result of a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the 'Second Circuit') affirming a grant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs in a",

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; unfair competition; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors.\n\nCompetitors in our industry include Altria G roup, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China,  Taiwan,  Thailand  and  V ietnam.  Some  competitors  have  different  profit,  volume  and  regulatory  objectives,  some  international  competitors  may  be  less susceptible than  PMI to changes in currency exchange rates, and some competitors may sell products in circumvention of applicable regulations that compete directly  with  our  products.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative  products  through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. See Item 1, Business-Competition for a description of the competitive environment in which we operate.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  changes  in  adult  consumer  preferences,  which  may  be  influenced  by  local  economic  conditions,  accessibility  to  our  products  and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n\n## To be successful, we must:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;\n- ensure that our products meet our quality standards;\n- develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;\n- improve productivity;\n- educate and encourage adult smokers to convert to our SFPs;\n- ensure effective adult consumer engagement, including communication about product characteristics and usage of SFPs;\n- mitigate the impact of developments that cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands;\n- provide excellent customer care;\n- ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and\n- be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.\n\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase low-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

      "question": "How do MDLZ, PG, and PM differ in their current portion of long-term debt for 2023, and what does this reveal about their short-term liquidity pressures and debt management strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MDLZ reported a current portion of long-term debt of $2,101 million, PG reported $3,838 million, and PM reported $4,698 million. These figures highlight varying degrees of short-term liquidity pressures across the three companies. MDLZ has the lowest current debt obligation, suggesting a more conservative approach to debt management or a longer-term debt structure. PG's higher current portion indicates a moderate level of upcoming refinancing or repayment needs, while PM's significantly higher current debt load suggests greater near-term liquidity demands, potentially requiring stronger cash flow generation or access to short-term financing.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) used commercial paper borrowings to finance the redemption of $500 million in Medium-Term Notes that matured in 2024, indicating a reliance on short-term debt to manage its capital structure. Coca-Cola (KO) had $1,139 million in outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2024, with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.0%, showing active use of this financing vehicle, though with significant unused capacity ($5,693 million). PepsiCo (PEP) highlighted commercial paper as a key part of its liquidity strategy, alongside long-term debt and cash from operations, to fund diverse obligations including debt repayments, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The comparison reveals that while all three use commercial paper, CL focuses on refinancing specific maturities, KO maintains flexibility with low utilization of backup lines, and PEP integrates it into a broader capital allocation framework.",

The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings. In March 2023, the Company issued $500 of three-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.800%, $500 of five-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.600% and $500 of ten-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.600%.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,725 (including under the facility discussed below) and could also issue long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for a five-year term expiring November 2027, which replaced, on substantially similar terms, the Company's $3,000 revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in August 2026. In November 2023, the Company extended the term of the credit facility for an additional year, ex piring in November 2028. In November 2024, the Company further ex tended the term of the credit facility for an additional year, ex piring in November 2029. Commitment fees related to the credit facility are not material.\n\nCertain agreements with respect to the Company's bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Executive Overview\n\n## Business Organization\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, 'we,' 'us,' 'our,' the 'Company' or 'Colgate') is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We seek to deliver consistent compounded earnings per share growth to help drive superior total shareholder return, as well as to provide Colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. We do this by developing and selling science-led products globally that make people's and their pets' lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our Sustainability &amp; Social Impact Strategy across our organization.\n\nWe are tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.\n\nOperationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. We compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. Approx imately two-thirds of our Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of our Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.\n\nThe Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of retailers, wholesalers, distributors, dentists and, in some geographies, skin health professionals. Through Hill's Pet Nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. We also sell certain of our products direct-to-consumer. We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.\n\nIn connection with management changes, we realigned the reporting structure of our skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are reported with our other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. In addition, we review market share, household penetration and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. The monitoring of these indicators and our Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the Company's use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' and 'Market Share Information' below.\n\n## The War in Ukraine\n\nThe war in Ukraine, and the related geopolitical tensions, have had and continue to have a significant impact on our operations in Ukraine and Russia, though it has not been material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no manufacturing facilities in Russia. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our business in the Eurasia region constituted approximately 1% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 2% of our consolidated operating profit.",

          "chunk_text": "products or competitive products among youth or non-smokers, even in situations over which we have no control, our reputation and credibility may suffer, the regulatory approach to our products may become more restrictive, and our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of SFPs may be significantly impacted.\n\nThe FDA's premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of two versions of our IQOS product as well as the premarket tobacco authorizations of 20 varieties of ZYN pouches are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements. Although we have received these authorizations from the FDA, there is no guarantee that the products will remain authorized for sale in the U.S., or that new versions of IQOS or other ZYN products will receive necessary authorizations, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or non-smoker initiation.\n\nMoreover, we also submitted additional premarket tobacco applications for other ZYN products after the September 9, 2020 deadline, and we are unable to market these products until the FDA authorizes such applications. In April 2024, we also submitted MRTPAs for ZYN products currently marketed in the U.S. and requested authorization of the modified risk claim. There is no guarantee that the ZYN products will receive the necessary authorizations from the FDA.\n\nThe commercialization of our products in the United States is dependent on successfully managing compliance with federal, state, and local laws, regulations, legal agreements, and related interpretations. Failure to successfully manage compliance and to resolve any disputes that may arise regarding the application of legal and administrative requirements to our products could negatively impact the timing, manner, or success of our SFP commercialization in the United States, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, revenues, cash flows, or profitability.\n\n## The financial and business performance of our smoke-free products is less predictable than our cigarette business.\n\nOur SFPs are novel products in a relatively new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. There may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business. The impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant, due to geopolitical or macroeconomic events that negatively impact SFP availability or adoption, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n## We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate smoke-free products and cigarettes with respect to taxation.\n\nTo date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our SFPs are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion, and accordingly they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. Nevertheless, we are unable to predict whether regulators will be issuing new regulations under which SFPs will be equally taxed in line with other tobacco products such as conventional cigarettes. If we cease to be successful in these efforts, SFP unit margins may be materially adversely affected, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, revenues, cash flows, and profitability.\n\n## Consumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets.\n\nThis decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, health concerns, competition, continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the continuing prevalence of illicit products. These factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in Item 7, Business Environment . A continuous decline in the consumption of cigarettes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and profitability, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our smoke-free transformation.\n\n## Cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.\n\nTax  regimes,  including  ex cise  tax es,  sales  tax es  and  import  duties,  can  disproportionately  affect  the  retail  price  of  cigarettes  versus  other  combustible  tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. Furthermore, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets.\n\nIn addition, increases in cigarette tax es are ex pected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and other noncompliant or otherwise illicit products.",

          "chunk_text": "## COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts)\n\n## 2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Colgate-Palmolive Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company's investments in consumer products companies with interests ranging between 20% and 50%, where the Company has significant influence over the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. Net income (loss) from such investments is recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, equity method investments included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $64 and $56, respectively. Unrelated third parties hold the remaining ownership interests in these investments. Investments with less than a 20% interest are recorded at cost and periodically adjusted based on observable price changes or quoted market prices in active markets, if applicable.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. As such, the most significant uncertainty in the Company's assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements includes pension and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves. Additionally, the Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments and retirement plan assets. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell its products to trade customers. Sales are recorded at the time control of the products is transferred to trade customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products. Control is the ability of trade customers to 'direct the use of' and 'obtain' the benefit from our products. In evaluating the timing of the transfer of control of products to trade customers, the Company considers several control indicators, including significant risks and rewards of products, the Company's right to payment and the legal title of the products. Based on the assessment of control indicators, sales are generally recognized when products are delivered to trade customers.\n\nNet sales reflect the transaction prices for contracts, which include units shipped at selling list prices reduced by variable consideration. Variable consideration includes expected sales returns and the cost of current and continuing promotional programs. Current promotional programs primarily include product listing allowances and co-operative advertising arrangements. Continuing promotional programs are predominantly consumer coupons and volume-based sales incentive arrangements. The cost of promotional programs is estimated using the expected value method considering all reasonably available information, including the Company's historical experience and its current expectations, and is reflected in the transaction price when sales are recorded. Adjustments to the cost of promotional programs in subsequent periods are generally not material, as the Company's promotional programs are typically of short duration, thereby reducing the uncertainty inherent in such estimates.\n\nSales returns are generally accepted at the Company's discretion and are not material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's contracts with trade customers do not have significant financing components or non-cash consideration and the Company does not have unbilled revenue or significant amounts of prepayments from customers. The Company records Net sales excluding taxes collected on its sales to its trade customers. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as contract fulfillment costs and classified as Selling, general and administrative expenses.",

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are  recorded  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company's  consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year.\n\nThe Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and  liabilities  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  in  interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar  payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreigncurrency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were $84 in 2022 and immaterial in 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe  Company  recognizes  sales  for  the  amount  of  consideration  collected  from  the  member,  which  includes  gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery,  which  are  included  in  other  current  liabilities  and  other  current  assets,  respectively,  in  the  consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh  foods.  The  Company  also  provides  expanded  products  and  services  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly  to  the  member,  shipping  and  handling  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  as  fulfillment  costs  and  included  in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the  member  picks  up  merchandise  at  the  warehouse.  Deferred  sales  are  included  in  other  current  liabilities  in  the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its  transactions  and  recognizes  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally  is  established  when  Costco  is  primarily  responsible  for  merchandising  decisions,  pricing  discretion,  and maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction.\n\nThe Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $2,174 and $2,042, respectively.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability  classified  as  accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  the  net  reduction  in  sales  was  $2,307,  $2,047,  and  $1,707 respectively.",

          "chunk_text": "We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.\n\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Refer to Note 3.\n\n## Advertising Costs\n\nOur Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures are expensed in the annual period in which the expenditure is incurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income were $4 billion, $3 billion and $4 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, advertising and production costs of $57 million and $83 million, respectively, were primarily recorded in the line item prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Shipping and Handling Costs\n\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers are also included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods sold by our consolidated bottlers to our customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to fulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised to customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are accrued.\n\n## Sales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes\n\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf of its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were collected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales, inventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Net Income Per Share\n\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Approximately 6 million stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share in both 2021 and 2020 because the stock options would have been antidilutive. The number of stock options excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2019 was insignificant.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash equivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line item other noncurrent",

      "answer": "Altria (MO) reports a funded status of $463 million for its pension plans as of the end of 2024, indicating that the fair value of plan assets ($6,545 million) exceeds the benefit obligation ($6,082 million). In contrast, PepsiCo (PEP) discloses that approximately $664 million of its total projected pension benefit obligation is unfunded due to unfavorable tax treatment for funding these plans. Procter & Gamble (PG) explains that its pension underfunding is primarily due to the lack of legal requirements or financial incentives to pre-fund pension obligations in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, where benefit payments are made directly from company cash as they come due. These differences highlight varying global pension funding strategies and regulatory environments impacting each company\u2019s balance sheet exposure.",

Mondelez (MDLZ) acknowledged higher overall operating costs, including SG&A, due to inflationary pressures and outlined cost-saving and productivity initiatives to manage these expenses. PepsiCo (PEP) referenced SG&A expenses in the context of adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts, indicating a retrospective evaluation of these costs.

          "chunk_text": "\nNet sales in Europe increased 7.7% in 2024 to $2,770, driven by volume growth of 4.1%, net selling price increases of 2.5% and positive foreign exchange of 1.1%. Organic sales in Europe increased 6.7% in 2024. Organic sales growth was led by Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Poland.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Europe in 2024 versus 2023 was primarily due to increases in Oral Care and Personal Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste category. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the body wash category.\n\nOperating profit in Europe increased 15% in 2024 to $658, or 140 bps to 23.7% as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (370 bps), partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative ex pense (230 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in G ross profit was due to cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (290 bps), higher pricing and favorable mix (70 bps), partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (100 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased advertising investment (220 bps).",

We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to ev aluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believ e these metrics are  useful  to  inv estors  as  they  prov ide  supplemental  information  in  addition  to  our  U.S.  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  ('U.S.  GAAP') financial  results.  We  believ e  it  is  useful  to  prov ide  inv estors  with  the  same  financial  information  that  we  use  internally  to  make  comparisons  of  our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and ev aluate our business. We believ e our non-GAAP financial measures should  always  be  considered  in  relation  to  our  GAAP  results.  Refer  to Non-GAAP Financial  Measures for  the  definitions  of  our  non-GAAP  financial measures and Consolidated Results of Operations for the respectiv e reconciliations.\n\nIn  addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of dev elopments and trends that could impact our rev enue and profitability objectiv es:\n\n## Demand\n\nWe monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and bev erage categories in which we sell our products. Core snacks categories continued to expand due to the continued growth of snacking as a consumer behav ior around the world. As part of our strategic plan, we seek to driv e category growth by lev eraging our local and consumer-focused commercial approach, making inv estments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building strong routes to market in both emerging and dev eloped markets and improv ing our av ailability across multiple channels. We believ e these actions will help driv e demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets.\n\n## Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends\n\nSnack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income lev els associated with a growing middle  class,  particularly  in  emerging  markets.  We  believ e  that  snacks  continue  to  be  a  source  of  comfort  as  well  as  excitement  and  v ariety  for consumers. Social media increasingly helps consumers find food trends, inspiration and connection on their social media and other feeds. Consumers are  also  interested  in  buying  snacks  conv eniently,  whether  through  same-day  deliv ery  platforms,  shipped  sources  or  different  retail  settings.  Many consumers also continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchase decisions, v aluing sustainably sourced ingredients, low carbon footprint preparation and lower waste packaging. We seek to continue to offer snacks that meet consumer needs and preferences and align with our strategic priorities.\n\n## Pricing\n\nOur net rev enue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions, such as increasing input and operating costs due to supply, transportation and labor constraints, the impact of tariffs and higher cost trends. We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including market factors, transportation, logistics and changes in our product input costs, and we hav e increased prices to control costs giv en significant cost inflation.\n\n## Operating Costs\n\nOur  operating  costs  include  raw  materials,  labor,  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses,  taxes,  currency  impacts  and  financing  costs.  We manage these costs through cost saving and productiv ity initiativ es, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. We experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher ov erall raw material (particularly cocoa) and labor costs that hav e continued to rise. Refer to Commodity Trends for additional information.\n\n## Trade and Regulatory Uncertainty\n\nIn many markets, including the United States, a portion of our products, including significant inputs, are imported from other jurisdictions. On February 1, 2025, the United States gov ernment announced tariffs up to 25% on imports from certain countries, including Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on product  imports  from  certain  countries,  including  China.  While  we  are  still  ev aluating  the  potential  impact  of  these  actions  as  well  as  our  ability  to mitigate the impact, they are expected to adv ersely impact our rev enue and cost of goods sold in the United States. If the prov isions of those tariffs were maintained as proposed, we would expect those adverse impacts to be significant. In addition, retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries or other potential gov ernment actions, would likely result in further adv erse impacts to our rev enue and cost of goods sold. For additional information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors , including the risk entitled ' We are subject to risks from changes to the trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations by the U.S. and/or other foreign governments .'",

Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.\n\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax  litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\n\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $6,805 million and $11,599 million, respectively, a decrease of $4,794 million, or 41%. This decrease was primarily driven by the $6.0 billion IRS Tax  Litigation Deposit, an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency ex change rate fluctuations, higher other tax  payments, increased charitable donations, and the reduced operating cash flows resulting from the refranchising of our bottling operations. The decrease was also impacted by additional annual incentive payments in the current year due to improved business performance in the prior year. These items were partially offset by strong cash operating results, the transfer of surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company, payments in the prior year resulting from the buildup of inventory to manage potential supply chain disruptions, increased dividend payments from our equity method investees, and $167 million of the $275 million milestone payment for fairlife in the prior year. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the refranchising of our bottling operations. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the pension transfer. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the milestone payment for fairlife.\n\n## Cash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $2,524 million in 2024 and net cash used in investing activities was $3,349 million in 2023.\n\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments\n\nIn 2024, purchases of investments were $5,640 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $6,589 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $949 million.

Gross profit in 2020 included acquisition-related costs. Excluding acquisition-related costs in 2020, Gross profit increased to $10,375 in 2021 from $10,021 in 2020, reflecting an increase of $565 resulting from higher Net sales and a decrease of $211 resulting from lower Gross profit margin.\n\nWorldwide Gross profit margin decreased to 59.6% in 2021 from 60.8% in 2020. This decrease in Gross profit margin was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (450 bps), partially offset by cost savings from the Company's funding-thegrowth initiatives (210 bps) and higher pricing (120 bps).\n\n",

For additional information about the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, refer to the heading 'Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange' below.\n\n## Gross Profit Margin\n\nGross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the operating costs incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.\n\nOur gross profit margin increased to 60.3 percent in 2021 from 59.3 percent in 2020. This increase was primarily due to the impact of favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel and package mix as well as the gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in many markets throughout 2021, partially offset by the impact of increased commodity and transportation",

Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume (due to increased promotional activity and innovation) and increased pricing were partially offset by increased promotional  spending  (versus  the  prior  year  with  low promotional activity due to the pandemic) and unfavorable  mix  (due  to  disproportionate  growth  in  the club  channel,  which  have  lower  than  category-average selling  prices).  Organic  sales  also  increased  low  single digits. North America's share of the family care category increased nearly a point.\n\nNet earnings in fiscal 2022 decreased 10% to $3.3 billion as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 280 basispoint  decrease  in  net  earnings  margin.  Net  earnings  margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially  offset  by  lower  SG&amp;A  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales. Gross  margin  decreased  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in commodity and transportation costs partially offset by increased pricing.

      "answer": "KO reported that higher commodity costs negatively impacted operating income across multiple regions, including Latin America, North America, Asia Pacific, and Bottling Investments, with specific mentions of cost pressures offsetting favorable pricing initiatives. MDLZ disclosed that it uses hedging, pricing adjustments, and cost control to manage commodity cost volatility, particularly for cocoa, dairy, wheat, edible oils, sugar, and nuts, but noted that full protection from cost increases is not always possible. PEP quantified the impact of higher commodity costs as a significant headwind, with Europe citing an 11-percentage-point impact and AMESA reporting a 70-percentage-point impact, primarily from potatoes, sweeteners, packaging, and grains. Together, these disclosures reveal that while all three companies face commodity cost pressures, their regional exposure and mitigation strategies differ, with KO experiencing broad regional cost pressures, MDLZ emphasizing proactive risk management, and PEP highlighting the acute impact in emerging markets.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Altria (MO), and PepsiCo (PEP) each manage and disclose the role of reinvested earnings in their capital allocation strategies, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to long-term growth and shareholder returns?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) shows a steady increase in reinvested earnings from $66.6B in 2020 to $69.1B in 2021, reflecting consistent net income growth offset by significant dividend payouts. Altria (MO) reports a decline in earnings reinvested in the business from $34.7B in 2020 to $30.7B in 2021, indicating a reduction in retained capital amid a broader decline in stockholders' equity. PepsiCo (PEP) highlights a strategic intent to reinvest $7B of undistributed international earnings indefinitely, signaling a focus on global expansion and tax-efficient capital retention. These differences suggest that KO prioritizes dividend consistency with moderate reinvestment, MO is reducing internal reinvestment possibly due to sector headwinds, and PEP is aggressively reinvesting abroad for sustained international growth.",

        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Reinvested Earnings: KO's reinvested earnings increased from $66.555B to $69.094B from 2020 to 2021, driven by net income of $9.771B and offset by $7.251B in dividends.",
        "Hop 2: MO \u2192 Reinvested Earnings: MO's 'Earnings reinvested in the business' decreased from $34.679B in 2020 to $30.664B in 2021, reflecting a reduction in retained capital.",
        "Hop 3: PEP \u2192 Reinvested Earnings: PEP intends to reinvest $7B of undistributed international earnings indefinitely, supporting global growth and tax-efficient capital deployment."

These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.3 billion in 2022, $26.8  billion  between  2023  and  2041  and  $2.9  billion  may  be  carried  forward  indefinitely.  We  establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\n\n## Undistributed International Earnings\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, we had approximately $7 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $7 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future  distribution  of  these  earnings  would  not  be  subject  to  U.S.  federal  tax  expense,  no  deferred  tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state  taxes  have  been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\n\n## Note 6 - Share-Based Compensation\n\nOur  share-based  compensation  program  is  designed  to  attract  and  retain  employees  while  also  aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.\n\nThe Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs.\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, 44 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reported 3.3% GAAP net sales growth in 2024, with strong performance in Latin America (3.1%) and Africa/Eurasia (1.2%), though foreign exchange headwinds (-4.1%) dampened overall growth. Costco saw 5% total net sales growth in 2024, driven by consistent performance across U.S. (4%), Canada (6%), and Other International (9%) markets. Walmart reported 4.9% total U.S. net sales growth in fiscal 2024, with Walmart U.S. growing at 4.8% and Sam's Club U.S. at 2.3%. Each company experienced different regional dynamics and external impacts, such as foreign exchange and fuel price fluctuations, reflecting varied growth trajectories within the consumer staples sector.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Altria (MO), and Philip Morris (PM) each reflect the trend in reinvested earnings over the past year, and what does this reveal about their respective capital allocation strategies?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) increased its reinvested earnings from $73,782 million in 2023 to $76,054 million in 2024, indicating a net addition of $10,631 million in net income offset by $8,359 million in dividends. Altria (MO) saw a rise in earnings reinvested in the business from $31,094 million in 2023 to $35,516 million in 2024, despite a stock repurchase cost of $42,194 million. Philip Morris (PM) experienced a decline in reinvested earnings from $34,090 million in 2023 to $32,869 million in 2024, even though it had a significant stock repurchase cost of $35,640 million. This suggests that KO is prioritizing reinvestment despite high dividend payouts, MO is growing reinvested equity despite aggressive stock buybacks, and PM is reducing reinvested equity while maintaining a large buyback program.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Reinvested Earnings: KO's reinvested earnings increased from $73,782 million in 2023 to $76,054 million in 2024, driven by $10,631 million in net income and offset by $8,359 million in dividends.",
        "Hop 2: MO \u2192 Reinvested Earnings: MO's earnings reinvested in the business increased from $31,094 million in 2023 to $35,516 million in 2024, despite $42,194 million in stock repurchase costs.",
        "Hop 3: PM \u2192 Reinvested Earnings: PM's reinvested earnings decreased from $34,090 million in 2023 to $32,869 million in 2024, even with $35,640 million in stock repurchase costs."

      "answer": "Altria (MO) reported a significant increase in net earnings to $8,130 million in 2023, up from $5,764 million in 2022, indicating strong performance despite broader economic pressures. Procter & Gamble (PG) acknowledged multiple external risks\u2014including geopolitical instability, commodity price fluctuations, foreign exchange volatility, and regulatory changes\u2014that could negatively impact net earnings. PG actively manages these risks through pricing adjustments and cost optimization. Target (TGT), while not directly quantifying external impacts on net earnings, noted that 2023 included 53 weeks compared to 52 in 2022 and 2021, which may have influenced earnings comparisons and highlighted the use of non-GAAP metrics like EBIT and EBITDA to assess operational efficiency amid external pressures. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies are subject to macroeconomic and operational risks, they experience and manage these impacts differently based on industry dynamics and strategic responses.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reports a common stock value of $1,466 million in 2024, with no change from 2023, indicating a stable capital structure with no new issuances or repurchases affecting the par value. Costco (COST) shows a minimal common stock value of $2 million in 2024, consistent with 2023, suggesting a focus on retained earnings and minimal reliance on equity adjustments. PepsiCo (PEP) reports a much smaller common stock value of $23 million in 2024, with no change from 2023, but a significant repurchased stock value of $(41,021) million, indicating a strong emphasis on returning value to shareholders through buybacks.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) uses Total Shareowner Return to track and communicate long-term investment performance, showing a $100 investment from December 31, 2018, with reinvested dividends. Procter & Gamble (PG) explicitly ties its strategic focus to delivering TSR in the top one-third of its peer group, supported by a long-term growth algorithm involving organic sales growth, core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits, and adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater. Philip Morris International (PM) incorporates TSR as a weighted performance metric (40%) in its Performance Share Unit (PSU) awards, measuring both relative to a peer group and on an absolute basis, alongside other metrics like earnings growth and sustainability. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies emphasize shareholder value, KO focuses on historical return transparency, PG aligns strategy directly with TSR leadership, and PM integrates TSR into executive compensation with a broader performance framework.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Altria (MO), and Philip Morris (PM) each characterize the impact of legal and operational risks on their consolidated results of operations, and what does this reveal about the differing nature of their exposure to external liabilities?",

Altria (MO) highlights the potential material adverse impact of ongoing tobacco litigation on its consolidated results, noting the risk of large damages and bonding obligations, particularly in cases where co-defendants may not share liability proportionally.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Overview\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') is intended to help the reader understand The Coca-Cola Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this report. MD&amp;A includes the following sections:\n\n- Our Business - a general description of our business and its challenges and risks.\n- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.\n- Operations Review - an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. An analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2020 and 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 can be found in MD&amp;A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n- Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations, foreign exchange, and the impact of inflation and changing prices.\n\n## Our Business\n\n## General\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; hydration, sports, coffee and tea; nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world's top six nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.\n\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the Company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.1 billion of the approximately 63 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\n\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\n\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n\n- beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as 'beverage bases,' and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our 'concentrate operations'); and\n- finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our 'finished product operations').\n\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\n\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as our 'bottlers' or our 'bottling partners'). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Note 18. Contingencies\n\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and USSTC, as well as their respective indemnitees and Altria's investees. Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, unfair trade practices, antitrust, tax, contraband shipments, patent infringement, employment matters, claims alleging violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'), claims for contribution and claims of competitors, shareholders or distributors. Legislative action, such as changes to tort law, also may expand the types of claims and remedies available to plaintiffs.\n\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. Damages claimed in some tobacco-related and other litigation are or can be significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions of dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. In certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants' liability is joint and several. In such cases, Altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment. As a result, Altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts. Furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, Altria or its subsidiaries also may be required to pay interest and attorneys' fees.\n\nAlthough PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. This risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and Puerto Rico limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all. As discussed below, however, tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida's bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well. Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court. States, including Florida, also may seek to repeal or alter bond cap statutes through legislation. Although Altria cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.\n\nAltria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed elsewhere in this Note 18. Contingencies : (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nAltria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation. Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain. It is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. Each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges. However, Altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of Altria to do so.",

However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\n\n## CCAA Proceedings and Stay of Tobacco-Related Cases Pending in Canada\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec's decision in both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp., and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019 respectively. CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred  in  carrying  on  its  business  in  the  ordinary  course  after  the  CCAA  filing,  including  obligations  to  employees,  vendors,  and suppliers.  As  further  described  in  Note  20. Deconsolidation  of  RBH ,  RBH's  financial  results  have  been  deconsolidated  from  our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019. As part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 31, 2022 of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .'  Ernst &amp; Young Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. In accordance with the CCAA process, as the parties work towards a plan of arrangement or compromise in a confidential mediation, it is anticipated that the court will set additional hearings and further extend the stay of proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all tobacco-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be extended by the stay period. While RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings will provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada. It is not possible to predict the resolution of the underlying legal proceedings or the length of the CCAA process.\n\nStayed Litigation - Canada\n\n## Smoking and Health Litigation - Canada\n\nIn the first class action pending in Canada, Conseil Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Sur Le Tabac Et La Sant\u00e9 and Jean-Yves Blais v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada ,  filed in November 1998, RBH and other Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants. The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who suffers allegedly from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015. The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members' compensatory damages totaled approximately CAD 15.5 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $12.1 billion). The trial court awarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating 20% to our subsidiary (approximately CAD 3.1 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $2.4  billion)).  In  addition,  the  trial  court  awarded  CAD  90,000  (approximately  $70,500)  in  punitive  damages,  allocating  CAD  30,000 (approximately $23,500) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at 99,957 members. RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish security totaling CAD 226 million (approximately $177 million) to cover both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases, which RBH has paid in installments through March 2017. The Court of Appeal ordered Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to furnish security totaling CAD 758 million (approximately $594 million) in installments through June 2017. JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish security in accordance with plaintiffs' motion. The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court's judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal.",

PG maintained the highest total long-term debt at $22,848 million, but spread across a broader range of maturities including significant amounts due in 2026 ($2,450 million), 2027 ($4,125 million), and beyond.

KO includes shipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from manufacturing to distribution centers and to customers in cost of goods sold, except for costs incurred by consolidated bottlers, which are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. PM includes shipping and handling as part of the cost of sales, along with raw materials and manufacturing costs. These differences reveal that COST treats shipping and handling as a fulfillment cost tied directly to e-commerce and direct-to-member delivery, KO integrates it into broader product cost structures with distinctions for bottler operations, and PM treats it as a core component of manufacturing and logistics cost of sales.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nderivative instruments, but generally qualify for the 'normal purchases and normal sales' exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nThe functional currencies of the Company's international subsidiaries are their local currencies. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are  recorded  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company's  consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year.\n\nThe Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and  liabilities  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  in  interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar  payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreigncurrency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were $84 in 2022 and immaterial in 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe  Company  recognizes  sales  for  the  amount  of  consideration  collected  from  the  member,  which  includes  gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery,  which  are  included  in  other  current  liabilities  and  other  current  assets,  respectively,  in  the  consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh  foods.  The  Company  also  provides  expanded  products  and  services  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly  to  the  member,  shipping  and  handling  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  as  fulfillment  costs  and  included  in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the  member  picks  up  merchandise  at  the  warehouse.  Deferred  sales  are  included  in  other  current  liabilities  in  the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its  transactions  and  recognizes  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally  is  established  when  Costco  is  primarily  responsible  for  merchandising  decisions,  pricing  discretion,  and maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction.\n\nThe Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $2,174 and $2,042, respectively.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability  classified  as  accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  the  net  reduction  in  sales  was  $2,307,  $2,047,  and  $1,707 respectively.",

          "chunk_text": "We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.\n\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Refer to Note 3.\n\n## Advertising Costs\n\nOur Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures are expensed in the annual period in which the expenditure is incurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income were $4 billion, $3 billion and $4 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, advertising and production costs of $57 million and $83 million, respectively, were primarily recorded in the line item prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Shipping and Handling Costs\n\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers are also included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods sold by our consolidated bottlers to our customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to fulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised to customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are accrued.\n\n## Sales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes\n\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf of its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were collected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales, inventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Net Income Per Share\n\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Approximately 6 million stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share in both 2021 and 2020 because the stock options would have been antidilutive. The number of stock options excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2019 was insignificant.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash equivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line item other noncurrent",

Estimated costs associated with device warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.\n\nOur marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to  the  manufacture  of  our  products  (including  general  corporate  expenses),  and  costs  incurred  to  develop  new  products.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) reported a net change in pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities of $152 million (before tax) in 2024, contributing positively to its comprehensive income. PepsiCo (PEP) disclosed $1,190 million in pension plan assets in 2024, indicating a significant noncurrent asset tied to its pension obligations. Philip Morris (PM), on the other hand, reported a long-term employment costs liability of $1,883 million related to pensions in 2024, showing a growing funded deficit. These differences suggest that while KO is experiencing a net inflow or gain in pension liabilities, PEP maintains a large asset position in its pension plans, and PM faces increasing pension liabilities with limited offsetting assets, reflecting distinct pension funding and risk management strategies across the three companies.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) classifies shipping and handling costs as part of Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses, reporting $1,777 million in 2024. Costco (COST) treats shipping and handling costs incurred for merchandise as fulfillment costs and includes them in merchandise costs on a gross basis upon shipment. Philip Morris (PM) accounts for shipping and handling as costs to fulfill contracts, recognizing them in cost of sales, and accrues for such costs that have not yet been incurred at the time revenue is recognized. These differences highlight CL's administrative expense categorization, COST's inventory cost integration, and PM's contract fulfillment alignment with revenue recognition.",

          "chunk_text": "## COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Dollars in Millions Ex cept Share and Per Share Amounts)\n\n## Shipping and Handling Costs\n\nShipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) are classified as Selling, general and administrative ex penses and were $1,777, $1,771 and $1,874 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Marketing Costs\n\nThe Company markets its products through advertising and other promotional activities. Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of the remaining inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and E quipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.\n\nDetermining the fair value of the Company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates and the selection of royalty rates and discount rates. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nAs a result of a reporting structure realignment, the Company reallocated the goodwill of a certain reporting unit from the Europe segment to the North America segment. Before and after the reporting structure realignment, the Company completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment was required. Refer to Note 13, Segment Information for additional information.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.",

These items were $64, $46 and $84 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to gov ernment agencies and member returns. The Company reserv es for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recov ery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectiv ely, in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods.  The  Company also prov ides  expanded  products  and  serv ices  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  T he  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its transactions and recognizes rev enue on a gross basis.  The  Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or serv ice before it is transferred to the member. The majority of rev enue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Rev enue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, rev enue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  rev enue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  ov er  the  one-year  membership  period.  Deferred membership fees at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $2,501 and $2,337.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executiv e members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum v alue, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of nonredemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the net reduction in sales was $2,804, $2,576, and $2,307.\n\nThe Company sells and otherwise prov ides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for  outstanding  shop  card  balances  as  a  shop  card  liability,  net  of  estimated  breakage.  Shop  card  liabilities  are  included  in  other  current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCitibank, N.A. is the exclusiv e issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receiv es v arious forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receiv e, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries.\n\n## Merchandise Costs\n\nMerchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inv entory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company's depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, and are reduced by v endor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  are  provided  on  all  earnings  for  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States. These  provisions,  as  well  as  state  and  local  income  tax   provisions,  are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the  provision  for  income  tax es  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings. PMI  recognizes  income  tax es  associated  with  G lobal  Intangible  Low-Tax ed  Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\n\n## Leases\n\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange  for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the  lease  term. Lease ex pense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item. At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases. The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be ex ercised. Certain of PMI's leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage. These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs. PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Marketing costs\n\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, instore display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives. Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are ex pensed as incurred. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods. PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer's receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI's right to payment for those products and the customer's ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI's performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\n\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer. PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract. The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  PMI is a principal for majority of its arrangements and recognizes revenue at the transaction price, with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories  evolve. For arrangements where PMI acts as an agent, the net commission earned is recognized as revenue. PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive noted that transportation and logistics challenges, particularly during the pandemic, disrupted their global supply chain and increased operating costs. Procter & Gamble explicitly stated that transportation costs (including trucks and containers) are a significant component of their cost fluctuations, and they rely on pricing actions and cost-saving initiatives to offset these pressures. Philip Morris International indicated that inflationary pressures, including transportation and logistics, have significantly increased their expenses and that they expect moderate increases to continue into 2024. Their mitigation strategies\u2014Colgate's supply chain resilience efforts, P&G's pricing and sourcing adjustments, and PM's cost control and pricing discipline\u2014reflect differing levels of exposure and response to transportation inflation.",

      "question": "How do PepsiCo (PEP), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Philip Morris (PM) each disclose or characterize their exposure to pension-related obligations, and what do these differences reveal about their respective financial strategies and risk management approaches in 2022?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo (PEP) provides a multi-year pension obligation schedule, projecting $1,110 million for 2022 and a cumulative $5,385 million from 2027 to 2031, indicating a detailed forward-looking view of its pension liabilities. Procter & Gamble (PG) discusses pension obligations in the context of broader input cost pressures, suggesting that pension costs are part of a complex set of financial risks that the company actively manages through pricing and cost-saving initiatives. Philip Morris (PM) reports pension-related movements in its financial statements, including $294 million in net losses and $255 million in amortization expenses in 2022, highlighting the volatility and ongoing earnings impact of pension adjustments. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies manage pension liabilities, they differ in transparency, framing (quantitative vs. strategic vs. volatility-focused), and the extent to which pension costs influence their broader financial planning and risk mitigation strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "materials like pulp) and raw and packaging materials and the costs of labor, transportation (including trucks and containers), energy, pension and healthcare. Inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results  depend,  in  part,  on  our  continued  ability  to  manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and  sourcing  decisions,  while  maintaining  and  improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of  operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how  well  we  can  compete  with  our  local  and  global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all  of  our  categories,  we  compete  against  a  wide  variety  of global  and  local  competitors.  As  a  result,  we  experience ongoing  competitive  pressures  in  the  environments  in  which we  operate,  which  may  result  in  challenges  in  maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be  able  to  successfully  respond  to  competitive  factors  and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives,  product  delivery  windows  and  trade  terms.  In addition,  evolving  sales  channels  and  business  models  may affect  customer  and  consumer  preferences  as  well  as  market dynamics,  which,  for  example,  may  be  seen  in  the  growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry  into  certain  categories  and  growth  in  hard  discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing  sales  channels  and  business  models,  particularly  ecommerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe  sell  most  of  our  products  via  retail  customers,  which include  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty  beauty  stores  (including  airport  duty-free  stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores  and professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot  reach  agreement  with  a  key  customer  on  trade  terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if  a  key  customer  were  to  significantly  reduce  the  inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased  offerings  of  other  branded  manufacturers,  private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons,  significantly  tighten  product  delivery  windows  or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If  the  reputation  of  the  Company  or  one  or  more  of  our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation  of  our  brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and  our  financial  success  directly  depends  on  the  success  of our  brands.  The  success  of  our  brands  can  suffer  if  our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also  be negatively  impacted  if  the  Company  or  one  of  our  brands suffers  substantial  harm  to  its  reputation  due  to  a  significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions  of  certain  ingredients,  negative  perceptions  of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleumbased materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices, privacy lapses or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.  Additionally,  negative  or  inaccurate  postings  or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage  the reputation of our brands or the Company.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  real  or perceived  issues,  including  concerns  about  safety,  quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the  Company  or  our products  could  be  negatively  impacted,  and  our  results  of operations  or  cash  flows  could  suffer.

We manage interest rate volatility by modifying the pricing or maturity characteristics of certain liabilities so that the net impact on expense is not, on a material basis, adversely affected by movements in interest rates. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value. We expect the effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation to be substantially offset by our gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to these hedged liabilities. We use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps that have indices related to the pricing of specific liabilities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. As a matter of policy, we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments for interest rate risk management. We use interest rate swaps to economically convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. Under the interest rate swap contracts, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts, which is calculated based on an agreedupon notional amount. We use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt obligations. We also execute cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge interest payments on newly issued debt denominated in a different currency than the functional currency of the borrowing entity. Substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n\nHedges of net investments in non-U.S. operations . We have numerous investments outside the United States. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to changes and volatility in currency exchange rates. We use local currency denominated debt to hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. We designated our euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall international operations. The gains and losses on our net investment in these designated international operations are economically offset by losses and gains on our euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings. The change in the debt's value, net of deferred taxes, is recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nWe use derivatives instruments such as cross-currency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge certain investments in our non-U.S. operations against movements in exchange rates. The after-tax gain/(loss) on these net investment hedge contracts is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income and the pre-tax impacts of the cash flows from these contracts are reported as other investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Income Taxes:\n\nOur provision for income taxes includes amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effects of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of our assets and liabilities, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse.\n\nThe realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider any carryback potential, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences (including liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits), future taxable income and tax planning strategies.\n\nWe recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. Future changes related to the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions could affect tax expense in the period when the change occurs.\n\nWe monitor for changes in tax laws and reflect the impacts of tax law changes in the period of enactment. When there is refinement to tax law changes in subsequent periods, we account for the new guidance in the period when it becomes known.",

      "question": "How do Altria (MO), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Philip Morris (PM) each report their deferred income tax positions in their 2024 financial disclosures, and what do these differences suggest about their respective tax strategies or liabilities?",
      "answer": "Altria (MO) reports a deferred income tax liability of $101 million as part of the final purchase price allocation in a transaction, indicating a measurement period adjustment that reduced the initial liability. Procter & Gamble (PG) shows a significant deferred income tax liability of $6,516 million on its balance sheet, reflecting long-term tax obligations tied to its global operations. Philip Morris (PM) reports a deferred income tax asset of $940 million, suggesting future tax benefits from temporary differences. These differences indicate contrasting tax strategies and reporting practices: MO\u2019s deferred tax position is tied to a specific acquisition accounting adjustment, PG reflects substantial long-term tax liabilities consistent with its multinational scale, and PM shows a sizeable deferred tax asset, potentially reflecting reinvestment of earnings or tax planning strategies.",

        "Hop 1: MO \u2192 Deferred income taxes: MO reports a deferred income tax liability of $101 million as part of the final purchase price allocation, down from $167 million due to a $66 million measurement period adjustment.",
        "Hop 2: PG \u2192 Deferred income taxes: PG discloses $6,516 million in deferred income taxes as of 2024, indicating a large long-term tax liability likely due to its global operations and tax structure.",
        "Hop 3: PM \u2192 Deferred income taxes: PM reports a deferred income tax asset of $940 million, suggesting future tax benefits from temporary differences, indicating a different tax planning or operational structure compared to PG."

      "answer": "MDLZ cited that global macroeconomic conditions, including increases in transportation costs, have contributed to cost pressures across its international operations, impacting profitability. PG identified transportation cost increases as part of broader cost pressures that affect its global supply chain and earnings. PM specifically quantified transportation cost increases in 2024, noting that higher shipping rates across all modes (air, ocean, inland) due to capacity constraints had a measurable impact on cost of sales. While all three companies acknowledged transportation cost pressures, PM provided the most specific financial impact, whereas MDLZ and PG framed the issue within broader macroeconomic and supply chain volatility.",

For example, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East could impact demand for our products or result in increased supply chain costs or other cost impacts. High unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending. Declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adv ersely impact our profitability. The nature and degree of the v arious risks we face can also differ significantly among our regions and businesses.\n\nAll of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased rev enues and could materially and adv ersely affect our product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, stock price, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short- or long-term.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  ris ks   from  changes   to  the  trade  policies   and  tariff  and  import/export  regulations   by  the  U.S.  and/or  other  foreign governments.\n\nChanges in the import and export policies, including trade restrictions, new or increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, sanctions and countersanctions, safeguards or customs restrictions by the U.S. and/or other foreign",

          "chunk_text": "## Governmental Investigations\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters, including tax, customs, antitrust, advertising, and labor practices. We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.\n\nThese developments above have or may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges.\n\nFor further details, see Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 8, Note 4. War in Ukraine and the \"Trade Policy \" section of this Item 7.\n\n## Impact of Inflation on Our Business and Mitigation E fforts\n\nLike many other global companies, we have experienced inflationary pressures in 2022, 2023 and 2024, including: growing pressures on the cost of certain direct materials, wages, energy, transportation, and logistics as well as an increased cost of capital due to interest rate increases driven by the response to increased inflation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

PG reports its EBIT as a percentage of net sales, showing a decline from 23.1% in 2021 to 22.4% in 2022, reflecting margin pressures. PM mentions EBIT in the context of its income tax disclosures but does not provide specific figures, suggesting a less transparent or less segmented presentation of pre-tax earnings.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) is increasing its investments in digital trade promotions to adapt to evolving consumer shopping habits, particularly in e-commerce, aiming to maintain brand loyalty and competitiveness in a digital environment. Mondelez (MDLZ) categorizes trade promotions as part of its marketing initiatives, using them to support price features, displays, and other merchandising activities by customers, while also investing in digital commerce strategies to grow its global snacking business. Philip Morris (PM) records trade promotions as a reduction of revenues, estimating amounts due to customers based on historical utilization, and supports products through discounts, rebates, and in-store display incentives. This reveals that while all three companies use trade promotions to drive customer engagement, KO emphasizes digital transformation, MDLZ integrates promotions into broader marketing and digital commerce strategies, and PM focuses on precise revenue recognition accounting tied to customer incentives. These differences reflect varying strategic emphases on digital adaptation, omnichannel marketing, and financial reporting accuracy in managing trade promotion expenses.",

      "answer": "In 2022, foreign exchange had a favorable 4.5-percentage-point impact on PepsiCo's Latin America operating profit, contributing to a 33% overall operating profit increase in that region. In contrast, Procter & Gamble reported that unfavorable foreign exchange reduced its Fabric & Home Care segment net sales by 2%. Meanwhile, Philip Morris International disclosed a $146 million deferred income tax liability related to foreign exchange at the end of 2021, which was not present in 2020 or 2022, indicating a significant but temporary tax-related impact from currency movements. These differences reveal that PepsiCo benefited from favorable currency dynamics in Latin America, while P&G faced headwinds in international markets, and PM experienced complex tax implications from foreign exchange fluctuations.",

Global market share of the Fabric &amp; Home Care segment increased 1.5 points.\n\n- Fabric  Care  net  sales  increased  high  single  digits.  The positive impacts of a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased  pricing,  increased  trade  spend  efficiencies  and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America  and  growth  of  fabric  enhancers  and  premium forms,  all  of  which  have  higher  than  category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in North  America and increased  low  single  digits  in  Asia  Pacific,  both  due  to market growth and innovation. Global market share of the fabric care category increased more than a point.\n- Home Care net sales were unchanged. Negative impacts of a  low  single  digit  decrease  in  volume,  increased  trade spending and unfavorable foreign exchange were offset by increased  pricing.  Organic  sales  increased  low  single digits.  V olume  decreased  20%  in  IMEA  (due  to  market contraction  and  competitive  activity)  and  decreased  low single digits in North America (due to market contraction versus  a  prior  year  that  benefited  from  pandemic-related consumption increases). Global market share of the home care category increased more than a point.\n\nNet earnings decreased 5% to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 190 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased  due  primarily  to  a  reduction  in  gross  margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by  an  increase  in  commodity  and  transportation  costs,  and unfavorable  mix  caused  by  the  growth  of  premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segmentaverage  gross  margins,  partially  offset  by  increased  pricing.

      "answer": "PEP incorporates the expected return on assets as a reduction in pension and retiree medical expenses, based on long-term rates that are reviewed annually but not significantly influenced by short-term asset returns. PM anticipates a higher expected return on assets in 2024, which partially offsets an overall increase in pension expense, indicating sensitivity to actuarial assumptions. TGT reports a negative value for expected return on assets (-$269 million in 2023), directly reducing total pension benefits expense. Together, these approaches reveal differing sensitivities to asset performance, assumption-setting practices, and financial planning strategies around pension liabilities.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) shows no amortization of prior service cost (credit) in 2021, a small positive amount in 2020, and a negative amount in 2019, indicating minimal or fluctuating legacy benefit plan amendments affecting current costs. PepsiCo (PEP) explains the amortization of prior service cost/(credit) as a reflection of benefit changes from plan amendments but does not provide specific figures, suggesting a qualitative rather than quantitative emphasis on this component. Procter & Gamble (PG) reports consistent positive amortization of prior service cost/(credit) for pension benefits at $28 million in 2022, $25 million in 2021, and $25 million in 2020, while showing significant negative values for other retiree benefits, indicating a structured recognition of legacy plan amendments in pension costs offset by adjustments in other benefit categories. Together, these patterns suggest that while all three companies manage legacy obligations, they differ in the magnitude and transparency of how they recognize prior service cost/(credit) amortization.",

Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest  cost.  Settlements  are  recognized  when  actions  are  irrevocable  and  we  are  relieved  of  the primary  responsibility  and  risk  for  projected  benefit  obligations.  Lump  sum  payouts  are  generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).\n- Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.\n\nThe components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the changes in commodity costs in 2024 impact the operating income or net earnings of The Coca-Cola Company (KO), PepsiCo (PEP), and Procter & Gamble (PG), and what does this reveal about their exposure to raw material fluctuations across different business segments?",
      "answer": "In 2024, The Coca-Cola Company (KO) experienced a decline in operating income across multiple segments\u2014Europe, Middle East and Africa; North America; and Bottling Investments\u2014due to higher commodity costs, although some regions like Global Ventures saw lower commodity costs contributing to improved operating income. PepsiCo (PEP) faced mixed effects: while LatAm benefited from lower commodity costs helping to offset other cost pressures, Europe saw an 8-percentage-point negative impact from higher commodity costs. Procter & Gamble (PG) reported improved net earnings margin, in part due to lower commodity costs contributing to gross margin expansion. This reveals that while all three companies are sensitive to commodity cost fluctuations, the net impact varies by region and business strategy, with KO most broadly affected negatively, PEP showing regional divergence, and PG benefiting from favorable cost trends.",

The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by a decline in concentrate sales volume of 1%, higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 15%, partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives.\n\nLatin America reported operating income of $3,780 million and $3,432 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 3% and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses, higher other operating charges and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 17%.\n\nOperating income for North America for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $4,336 million and $4,435 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses and higher other operating charges, partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 1% and favorable pricing initiatives.\n\nAsia Pacific's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $2,148 million and $2,040 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 2%, favorable pricing initiatives, lower other operating charges and the impact of acquired brands and structural changes, partially offset by higher commodity costs and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 2%.\n\nGlobal Ventures' operating income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $359 million and $329 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 4%, lower commodity costs and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1%, partially offset by increased marketing spending and higher operating expenses.\n\nBottling Investments' operating income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $496 million and $578 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India, higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending, higher operating expenses, and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1%, partially offset by unit case volume growth of 5% and favorable pricing initiatives.\n\nCorporate's operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $5,252 million and $3,705 million, respectively. Operating loss in 2024 increased primarily as a result of higher other operating charges due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition and higher operating expenses, partially offset by decreased marketing spending. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fairlife contingent consideration.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest income was $988 million in 2024, compared to $907 million in 2023, an increase of $81 million, or 9%. This increase was primarily driven by higher average investment balances on our Corporate and certain international investments.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest ex pense was $1,656 million in 2024, compared to $1,527 million in 2023, an increase of $129 million, or 8%. This increase was primarily due to the impact of higher average long-term debt balances compared to the prior year. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Equity Income (Loss) - Net\n\nEquity income (loss) - net represents our Company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. In 2024, equity income was $1,770 million, compared to equity income of $1,691 million in 2023, an increase of $79 million, or 5%. The increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results reported by certain of our equity method investees in the current year, partially offset by the impact of the sale of our ownership interests in certain of our equity method investees and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact. In addition, the Company recorded net charges of $92 million and $159 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represent the Company's proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.",

      "answer": "COST identifies Sam's Club as a direct competitor in the U.S. warehouse club segment, noting that many major metropolitan areas have multiple competing clubs, including Sam's. PEP highlights a dependency relationship, as Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club, accounted for approximately 13% of PEP\u2019s consolidated net revenue in 2021, with the loss of this customer having a material adverse effect on several of its divisions. WMT, as the parent company of Sam's Club, reports that Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club together generated approximately 82% of its consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, underscoring the strategic importance of Sam's Club within WMT\u2019s broader U.S. operations. Together, these perspectives reveal a complex dynamic where COST competes directly with Sam's Club, PEP is economically dependent on it as a major customer, and WMT operates it as a core part of its U.S. business, illustrating both competitive and interdependent relationships within the membership retail and wholesale channel.",

We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club. Many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products  are  high  quality,  offered  at  prices  that  are  generally  lower  than  national  brands,  and  help  lower  costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items.\n\nWe rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.\n\n## Available Information\n\nOur U.S. website is www.costco.com.

We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for  concentrate,  finished  goods  and Aquafina  royalties  and  specify  the  manufacturing  process  required  for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.\n\nWe rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to  the  consumer.  For  our  independent  distributors  and  retailers,  these  incentives  include  volumebased  rebates,  product  placement  fees,  promotions  and  displays.  For  our  independent  bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and  other  promotional  offers.  Advertising  support  is  directed  at  advertising  programs  and  supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace  support,  such  as  point-of-purchase  materials,  product  placement  fees,  media  and  advertising. Vending  and  cooler  equipment  placement  programs  support  the  acquisition  and  placement  of  vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.\n\nChanges to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of  sales  through  e-commerce  websites  and  mobile  commerce  applications,  including  through  subscription services  and  other  direct-to-consumer  businesses,  the  integration  of  physical  and  digital  operations  among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2021,  sales  to  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  its  affiliates,  including  Sam's  Club  (Sam's),  represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.\n\n## Our Competition\n\nOur beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies,  as  well  as  regional,  local  and  private  label  manufacturers  and  economy  brands  and  other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our  products  are  sold,  including  the  United  States,  The  Coca-Cola  Company  is  our  primary  beverage competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft  Heinz  Company,  Link  Snacks,  Inc.,  Mondel\u0113z  International,  Inc.,  Monster  Beverage  Corporation, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.\n\nMany of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2021, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 19%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc.

Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\n\n## Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 82% of our consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles.\n\nWe are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, regulations, guidance, and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.\n\nFurthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola maintains what it considers prudent debt levels, using debt financing to lower its overall cost of capital and enhance return on equity. It emphasizes strong credit ratings and access to global financial markets to manage borrowing costs, with long-term debt rated 'A+' by S&P and 'A1' by Moody\u2019s. Mondelez reduced its total debt from $20.0 billion in 2020 to $19.5 billion in 2021, reflecting a strategy of active debt management and repayment, while also funding acquisitions like Chipita ($1.9 billion total purchase price) through long-term debt issuance. Procter & Gamble kept its debt relatively stable at $31.5 billion in 2022 (from $32.0 billion in 2021), using net debt increases to fund $10.0 billion in share repurchases and $8.8 billion in dividend payments, supported by strong credit ratings (AA- by S&P and Aa3 by Moody\u2019s). Together, these approaches show that while all three companies maintain disciplined debt strategies, KO emphasizes cost of capital optimization, MDLZ focuses on deleveraging and strategic acquisitions, and PG balances debt to support shareholder returns.",

We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our long-term debt was rated 'A+' by Standard &amp; Poor's and 'A1' by Moody's. Our commercial paper program was rated 'A-1' by Standard &amp; Poor's and 'P-1' by Moody's. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.\n\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company.\n\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.",

We expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.\n\n## Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:\n\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher amounts of net long-term debt repayments, higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid in 2021 than in 2020. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020.\n\n## Chipita Acquisition\n\nOn January 3, 2022, we closed on our acquisition of Chipita S.A. The cash consideration for Chipita totaled \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) and we assumed and substantially paid down \u20ac0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) of Chipita's debt in January for a total purchase price of approximately \u20ac1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). Cash paid for the business was raised from cash from operations and by issuing long-term debt in the third quarter of 2021. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures , and Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for additional details.\n\n## Supply Chain Financing\n\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers are from 30 to 180 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We also facilitate voluntary supply chain financing ('SCF') programs through several participating financial institutions. Under these programs, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine invoices that they want to sell to participating financial institutions. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in SCF programs has no bearing on our payment terms or amounts due. Our responsibility is limited to making payments based upon the agreed-upon contractual terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF programs and we have no economic interest in the suppliers' decision to participate in the SCF programs. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheet. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers that participate in the SCF programs are outstanding.\n\n## Guarantees:\n\nAs discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies , we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2021, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.\n\n## Debt:\n\nThe nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.\n\nRefer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for a projection of long-term debt scheduled to mature (including current maturities and finance leases) in future periods. In the next 12 months, we expect to repay approximately $1.7 billion of maturing long-term debt including: $1.2 billion in July 2022 and $0.5 billion in September 2022. We fund ongoing debt maturities and other long-term obligations using cash on hand or we may refinance obligations with longterm debt or short-term financing (such as our commercial paper borrowings) depending on financing available, timing considerations, flexibility to raise funding and the cost of financing.\n\nDuring December 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new $7.0 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior $6.0 billion authority. As of December 31, 2021, all $7.0 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available.\n\nOur total debt was $19.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $20.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Our debt-tocapitalization ratio was 0.41 at December 31, 2021 and 0.42 at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average term of",

Acquisition activity used $34 million in 2021, primarily related to a minor Health Care acquisition.\n\nProceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales were $110 million in 2022 and $42 million in 2021,  primarily from  fixed asset  sales  and  minor  brand divestitures.\n\nInvestment  Securities. Investments  provided  net  cash  of  $3 million  in  2022  primarily  from  the  sale  of  other  investments and  used  cash  of  $55  million  in  2021  primarily  from  the purchase of investment securities.\n\n## Financing Cash Flow\n\nNet  financing  activities  consumed  $14.9  billion  of  cash  in 2022, mainly due to treasury stock purchases and dividends to shareholders,  partially  offset  by  a  net  debt  increase  and  the impact of proceeds received from stock option exercises. Net financing  activities  consumed  $21.5  billion  in  cash  in  2021, mainly due to treasury stock purchases, dividends to shareholders  and  a  net  debt  reduction,  partially  offset  by  the impact of stock options.\n\nDividend  Payments. Our  first  discretionary  use  of  cash  is dividend  payments.  Dividends  per  common  share  increased 9% to $3.5227 per share in 2022. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $8.8 billion in 2022 and $8.3 billion in 2021. In April 2022, the Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.8698 to  $0.9133  per  share  on  Common  Stock  and  Series A  and  B Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) Convertible Class A Preferred  Stock.  This  is  the  66th  consecutive  year  that  our dividend  has  increased.  We  have  paid  a  dividend  for  132 consecutive years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.\n\nLong-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider  appropriate  after  evaluating  a  number  of  factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions  and  share  repurchase  activities)  and  the  overall cost  of  capital.  Total  debt  was  $31.5  billion  as  of  June  30, 2022, and $32.0 billion as of June 30, 2021. We generated $1.9 billion  from  net  debt  increases,  primarily  due  to  issuance  of bonds. In 2021, we used $3.9 billion for net debt reductions, including  $512  million  for  early  debt  extinguishment  costs related to the early retirement of $2.3 billion of debt.\n\nTreasury  Purchases. Total  share  repurchases  were  $10.0 billion in 2022 and $11.0 billion in 2021.\n\nImpact  of  Stock  Options  and  Other. The  exercise  of  stock options  and  other  financing  activities  generated  $2.0  billion and $1.6 billion of cash in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nAt  June  30,  2022,  our  current  liabilities  exceeded  current assets  by  $11.4  billion,  largely  due  to  short-term  borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations.  The  Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various Western European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related  to  any  country  subject  to  exchange  controls  that significantly  restrict  our  ability  to  access  or  repatriate  the funds.  Under  current  law,  we  do  not  expect  restrictions  or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe  utilize  short-  and  long-term  debt  to  fund  discretionary items,  such  as  acquisitions  and  share  repurchases.  We  have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.\n\nOn  June  30,  2022,  our  short-term  credit  ratings  were  P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard &amp; Poor's), while our long-term credit  ratings  were  Aa3  (Moody's)  and  AA-  (Standard  &amp; Poor's), all with a stable outlook.\n\nWe  maintain  bank  credit  facilities  to  support  our  ongoing commercial  paper  program.  The  current  facility  is  an  $8.0 billion  facility  split  between  a  $3.2  billion  five-year  facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2026 and November 2022, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities  do  not  have  cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of  signing.  In  addition  to  these  credit  facilities,  we  have  an automatically  effective  registration  statement  on  Form  S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short-  or  long-term  debt  securities.  For  additional  details  on debt, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements,  including  variable  interest  entities,  which  we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.",

      "answer": "Costco reports 443,126,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding with a par value of $0.005, contributing minimally to total equity at $2 million. PepsiCo has 1,372 million shares issued, with common stock valued at $23 million, reflecting a slightly higher emphasis on equity structure. Procter & Gamble shows 4,009.2 million shares issued of common stock with a stated value of $1 per share, amounting to $4,009 million, indicating a more substantial role of common stock in its capital structure. This comparison suggests that COST maintains a minimal par value approach, PEP uses a moderate par value with a focus on retained earnings, and PG emphasizes a higher stated value of common stock, aligning with its larger equity base.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reported a net amount recognized of $(562) million for pension and retiree benefits as of the end of fiscal year 2023, indicating an unfunded liability. PepsiCo (PEP) showed a mixed position, with a net amount recognized of $542 million for international pension plans (surplus) but a $(494) million unfunded liability for U.S. pension plans. Procter & Gamble (PG), in contrast, reported a net amount recognized of $(1,498) million for pension benefits, reflecting a significantly larger unfunded liability compared to the other two companies. These differences suggest varying degrees of pension funding strategies and liabilities, with PEP showing a more balanced approach in international markets, while PG faces a more substantial pension shortfall.",

      "answer": "MDLZ faces significant exposure due to its global footprint, with 73.4% of 2023 net revenues generated outside the U.S., highlighting transportation cost increases as a key risk in its international operations. PG explicitly identifies transportation costs (including trucks and containers) as a major component of its cost structure that is subject to fluctuation and requires active management through pricing and cost-saving initiatives. WMT emphasizes that transportation costs are impacted by fuel prices and supply chain disruptions, which directly affect its distribution and fulfillment operations, including delays and increased costs from port labor slowdowns. While all three companies are exposed to transportation cost volatility, PG's direct linkage of transportation costs to margin management and pricing strategy suggests a more acute sensitivity compared to MDLZ's broader global risk profile and WMT's supply chain logistics exposure.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive considers royalty rates as part of its income approach when valuing intangible assets, selecting them based on the long-term profitability of the brand and recent market transactions for similar brands. Coca-Cola includes royalty rates among several critical assumptions in impairment testing of equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets, highlighting their sensitivity to broader economic and market conditions. Philip Morris International uses royalty rates as a key assumption in estimating the fair value of trademarks and customer relationships, testing their reasonableness against economic and industry forecasts. Together, these disclosures show that royalty rates are a critical yet variable input in intangible asset valuation, with each company applying distinct contextual factors\u2014brand profitability, market transactions, and economic forecasts\u2014reflecting differing strategic approaches to intangible value assessment.",

PEP notes a significant increase in settlement charges due to lump sum distributions and annuity purchases, contributing to a $272 million rise in pension and retiree medical benefits expense. PM attributes its settlement and curtailment charges primarily to employee severance and early retirement programs. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies face settlement-related costs, the drivers and trends differ\u2014MO is reducing its liability, PEP is experiencing increased charges due to proactive pension de-risking, and PM is managing workforce restructuring through early retirement incentives.",

      "question": "How did MDLZ and PG's exposure to earnings volatility through hedging and foreign exchange risks contrast with TGT's reported net earnings stability in 2022?",
      "answer": "MDLZ disclosed that it expected to transfer $28 million in losses from interest rate cash flow hedges to earnings over the next 12 months, indicating a near-term drag on net earnings due to prior hedging activities. PG, on the other hand, highlighted multiple structural risks to net earnings, particularly from foreign exchange fluctuations in countries like Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, and Russia, which had historically reduced earnings and could do so again. PG also noted potential earnings impacts from global tax policy changes and supply chain execution risks. In contrast, TGT reported a strong and stable net earnings performance in 2022, reaching $6.9 billion with a significant increase from the prior year, and did not disclose any forward-looking earnings risks in the provided materials. This suggests that while MDLZ and PG faced identifiable headwinds that could reduce future earnings, TGT experienced a more favorable earnings trajectory without immediate volatility concerns being flagged in its disclosures.",

          "chunk_text": "consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our  gross  margin,  operating  margin,  net  earnings  and  cash flows.  Net  sales  could  also  be  adversely  impacted  following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including     supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we  are not successful in  executing  and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our  gross  margin,  operating  margin,  net  earnings  and  cash flows.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure  to  the  fluctuation  of  exchange  rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange  rate impacts of  measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a  currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation  of  transaction-related  working  capital  balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In  the  past  three  years,  a  number  of  foreign  currencies  have weakened  versus  the  U.S.  dollar,  leading  to  lower  sales  and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries  that  recently  had  and  are  currently  experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly  impacted  our  historical  net  sales,  costs  and  net earnings  and  could  do  so  in  the  future.  Increased  pricing  in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  may  offset  portions  of  the  currency  impacts  but  could also  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  consumption  of  our products,  which  would  negatively  affect  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative,  regulatory  or  enforcement  policies.  For  example, our  net  earnings  and  cash  flows  could  be  affected  by  any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under  the  current  work  being  led  by  the  OECD  for  the  G20 focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the  Economy.\"  The  breadth  of  the  OECD  project  extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most  countries,  is  likely  to  impact  most  large  multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly  establishing  a  15%  minimum  tax  on  their  foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and  climate change  matters.  Additionally, we  attempt  to carefully  manage  our  debt,  currency  and  other  exposures  in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and  pricing  controls,  such  as  Nigeria,  Turkey, Argentina  and Egypt. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere.  Changes  in  government  policies  in  these  areas might  cause  an  increase  or  decrease  in  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCOVID-19  Pandemic. Because  we  sell  products  that  are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nHowever, the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to governmental actions or  key  material,  transportation  and  labor  shortages  impacting our  ability  to  produce  and  ship  products)  or  could  impact consumers'  movements  and  access  to  our  products.  There could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning,  health  and  hygiene  products)  as  economic  activity resumes  following  slowdowns  or  relaxation  of  governmental restrictions.  Net,  the  uncertainty  in  the  timing  and  extent  of demand  volatility,  the  relaxation  and  reimplementation  of movement  restrictions,  the  timing  and  impact  of  potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a  resurgence  of  positive  cases  and  governmental  actions  in response  to  the  pandemic  may  result  in  heightened  volatility and negative impacts to net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic.\n\nWhile we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee  safety  measures  to  minimize  disruption  to  the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions  caused  either  by  resurgence  of  positive  cases  or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution  facility  or  the  inability  of  a  key  material  or transportation supplier to source and transport materials).\n\nThe pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. We continue to generate operating  cash  flows  to  meet  our  short-term  liquidity  needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.\n\nRussia-Ukraine  War .  The  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine  business  includes  two  manufacturing  sites.  We  have approximately  500  employees  including  both  manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reported noncurrent liabilities of $416 million in the U.S. and $273 million internationally as of the end of 2022, primarily tied to pension obligations. Mondelez International (MDLZ) disclosed significantly higher noncurrent liabilities of $27,204 million as of December 31, 2022, indicating a much larger long-term financial burden. Target (TGT) did not explicitly state its noncurrent liabilities in the provided excerpts but highlighted long-term obligations related to general liability and workers' compensation claims, which are recorded at net present value. These differences suggest that MDLZ has the highest long-term liability exposure among the three, while TGT's liabilities are more contingent and actuarially determined, and CL's are more structured and pension-focused.",

We estimate our ultimate cost based on analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. Note 20 provides the noncurrent balance of these liabilities. (a)\n\n## 15. Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Contingencies\n\nWe are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. When a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and, if material, disclose the estimated range of loss. We do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range. If we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that any of these identified claims or litigation will be material to our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.\n\n## Commitments\n\nPurchase obligations, which include all legally binding contracts such as merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketingrelated  contracts,  software  acquisition/license  commitments,  firm  minimum  commitments  for  inventory  purchases,  and  service contracts,  were  $944  million  and  $785  million  as  of  January  29,  2022,  and  January  30,  2021,  respectively.  These  purchase obligations are primarily due within three years and recorded as liabilities when goods are received or services are rendered. Real estate  obligations,  which  include  legally  binding  minimum  lease  payments  for  leases  signed  but  not  yet  commenced,  and commitments  for  the  purchase,  construction,  or  remodeling  of  real  estate  and  facilities,  were  $2.5  billion  and  $2.1  billion  as  of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. Over half of these real estate obligations are due within one year, a portion of which are recorded as liabilities.\n\nWe  issue  inventory  purchase  orders  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  which  represent  authorizations  to  purchase  that  are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "MDLZ reported $106 million in total charges in 2023, including $89 million in liabilities and $17 million in non-cash settlements. PEP disclosed $1.9 billion in cumulative pre-tax charges under its 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan through 2023, with $1.4 billion in cash expenditures, and also recognized charges related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and brand impairments. PM reported $78 million in net charges during 2023, with $79 million in cash spent and a resulting liability balance of $29 million. These figures show that while all three companies are managing cost through restructuring or impairment actions, the scale and scope of these initiatives vary significantly, with PEP undertaking a much larger and more long-term restructuring effort compared to MDLZ and PM.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Altria (MO), and Philip Morris (PM) each reflect the impact of prior service credits or costs in their pension and postretirement benefit disclosures, and what does this reveal about their respective benefit plan adjustments in 2023?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola reported a prior service credit of $17 million for pension plans in 2023, indicating a reduction in future benefit obligations. Altria recorded a prior service cost of $24 million for pensions but a large prior service credit of $293 million for postretirement benefits, suggesting significant restructuring or benefit changes in different plan categories. Philip Morris showed a minor prior service cost of $2 million for pensions in 2023, reflecting minimal adjustments to pension benefits. Collectively, these figures highlight varied approaches to managing retirement liabilities, with KO and MO showing notable credits in certain areas while PM maintained a more stable pension structure.",

      "answer": "COST highlights that rising healthcare and insurance costs are a key factor affecting labor and benefit costs, which are difficult to predict and could materially impact their financial condition. PG notes that healthcare cost increases are part of broader input cost fluctuations they must manage through pricing, cost-saving initiatives, and sourcing decisions to maintain margins. WMT indirectly references healthcare costs as part of the broader macroeconomic pressures, particularly in relation to inflation and rising essential service costs, which could affect consumer spending and in turn, their retail performance. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are sensitive to healthcare cost pressures, they experience and manage these costs at different levels\u2014COST directly through employee benefits, PG as part of a broader cost structure, and WMT through the lens of consumer affordability and macroeconomic trends.",

      "answer": "COST reported an effective tax rate of 25.9% in 2023, reflecting a relatively stable rate compared to prior years. KO had a significantly lower effective tax rate of 17.4% in 2023, driven by favorable impacts from equity income and excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. PM's effective tax rate was 22.4% in 2023, influenced by foreign rate differences, global intangible low-taxed income, and non-deductible goodwill impairment. These differences suggest varied exposures to international tax regimes and distinct tax planning strategies, particularly in how each company leverages cross-border income and credits.",

          "chunk_text": "## ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nGlobal E conomic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are G reater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and G ermany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments due to economic, political and social instabilities, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, foreign ex change and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2024.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the US dollar, which  have  negatively  impacted  net  sales,  net  earnings  and  cash  flows.  In  response  to  the  devaluation  of  foreign  currencies  (including  those  deemed  highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCommodities and  Supply  Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. V olatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution  operations  can  lead  to  increased  costs.  Legal  or  regulatory  requirements  and  sustainability  initiatives  may  result  in  increased  costs.  We  strive  to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response  to  certain  inflationary  or  cost  increases  may  also  offset  portions  of  the  cost  impacts;  however,  such  price  increases  may  negatively  impact  product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy'. G overnment controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.\n\nFor additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&amp;A), operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.\n\nFor most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG &amp;A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for ex ample, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&amp;A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in  SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased  advertising),  inflation,  foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.",

MO assumes a 6.5% health care cost trend rate for its postretirement plans, with no distinction made between short- and long-term projections. PM reports a 6.82% health care cost trend rate for its postretirement plans in 2024, with an ultimate trend rate of 4.71% expected by 2048. These assumptions suggest that while all three companies anticipate similar near-term increases in health care costs, they differ in their long-term expectations and the timeframes for stabilization, with PM projecting the highest initial growth rate but the lowest long-term rate and the longest timeframe to reach it.",

Altria (MO), in valuing developed technology acquired from NJOY, relied on volume growth rates as a key assumption in the income approach used to estimate fair value. While CL experienced volume growth through both organic and acquisition-driven channels, KO leveraged volume growth through its investee relationships, and MO projected future volume growth as part of its valuation assumptions for a strategic acquisition.

PM anticipates making $108 million in contributions to its pension plans in 2022 and provides a structured outlook on future benefit payments, reflecting a proactive funding strategy aligned with tax and regulatory considerations. TGT states it is not required to make any contributions to its qualified pension plan in 2022 but may choose to do so based on investment performance and plan funded status, suggesting a more flexible and contingent approach. Together, these perspectives reveal differing risk tolerance levels and funding philosophies across the three firms.",

WMT, through its inventory accounting methods, adjusts for inflation or deflation effects annually, particularly in its U.S. and Sam's Club segments that use the LIFO valuation method.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) states that sales returns are generally accepted at the company's discretion and are not material to its financial statements. Altria (MO) records estimated sales returns based on historical volume and return rates, and notes that differences between actual and estimated returns have not had a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Philip Morris (PM) estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience and indicates that these estimates are immaterial. The comparative analysis reveals that while all three companies treat sales returns as immaterial, CL and PM rely heavily on historical experience, whereas MO explicitly ties its estimates to volume and return rates, reflecting a more structured approach to forecasting. This suggests that MO may face more predictable or frequent return patterns due to the nature of its products (e.g., tobacco), compared to CL\u2019s consumer goods and PM\u2019s global tobacco and nicotine products.",

          "chunk_text": "## 2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Colgate-Palmolive Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company's investments in consumer products companies with interests ranging between 20% and 50%, where the Company has significant influence over the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. Net income (loss) from such investments is recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, equity method investments included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $81 and $83, respectively. Unrelated third parties hold the remaining ownership interests in these investments. Investments with less than a 20% interest are recorded at cost and periodically adjusted based on observable price changes or quoted market prices in active markets, if applicable.\n\n## Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. As such, the most significant uncertainty in the Company's assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements includes pension and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves. Additionally, the Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments and retirement plan assets. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation to sell its products to trade customers. Sales are recorded at the time control of the products is transferred to trade customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products. Control is the ability of trade customers to 'direct the use of' and 'obtain the benefit from' our products. In evaluating the timing of the transfer of control of products to trade customers, the Company considers several control indicators, including significant risks and rewards of products, the Company's right to payment and the legal title of the products. Based on the assessment of control indicators, sales are generally recognized when products are delivered to trade customers.\n\nNet sales reflect the transaction prices for contracts, which include units shipped at selling list prices reduced by variable consideration. V ariable consideration includes ex pected sales returns and the cost of current and continuing promotional programs. Current promotional programs primarily include product listing allowances and co-operative advertising arrangements. Continuing promotional programs are predominantly consumer coupons and volume-based sales incentive arrangements. The cost of promotional programs is estimated using the expected value method considering all reasonably available information, including the Company's historical experience and its current expectations, and is reflected in the transaction price when sales are recorded. Adjustments to the cost of promotional programs in subsequent periods are generally not material, as the Company's promotional programs are typically of short duration, thereby reducing the uncertainty inherent in such estimates.\n\nSales returns are generally accepted at the Company's discretion and are not material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

We reflect differences between actual and estimated sales returns in the period in which the actual amounts become known. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. All returned goods are destroyed upon return and not included in inventory. Consequently, we do not record an asset for USSTC's right to recover goods from customers upon return.\n\nSales incentives include variable payments related to goods sold by our businesses. We include estimates of variable consideration as a reduction to revenues upon shipment of goods to customers. The sales incentives that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n\n- Price promotion payments We make price promotion payments, substantially all of which are made to our retail partners to incent the promotion of certain product offerings in select geographic areas.\n- Wholesale and retail participation payments We make payments to our wholesale and retail partners to incent merchandising and sharing of sales data in accordance with our trade agreements.\n\nThese estimates primarily include estimated wholesale to retail sales volume and historical acceptance rates. Actual payments will differ from estimated payments to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Differences between actual and estimated payments are reflected in the period such information becomes available. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 5. Supplier Financing\n\nWe facilitate a voluntary supplier financing program through a third-party intermediary under which participating suppliers may elect to sell receivables due from us to participating third-party financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions ('Program'). Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether our supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. We pay the thirdparty intermediary a nominal fee to administer the Program. Under the terms of the agreement with our third-party intermediary, ALCS has a direct obligation to pay the participating financial institutions or the participating suppliers when payment obligations are due, unless such obligations are satisfied by the applicable ALCS affiliate. Additionally, Altria guarantees the obligations of ALCS to those parties. We do not enter into agreements with any of the participating financial institutions in connection with the Program. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers (up to 120 days) is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the Program.\n\nWe have no economic interest in a supplier's sale of a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the Program and reaches an agreement with a participating third-party financial institution, the qualifying supplier elects which individual invoices it sells to the financial institution.\n\nAll outstanding balances under the Program are recorded in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending confirmed outstanding obligations was as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, e-vapor and oral nicotine products. Our performance obligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers. PMI estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience, and these estimates are immaterial. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs for IQOS devices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized, based on a number of factors, including historical ex perience, product failure rates and warranty policies. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to  be  entitled  to  under  the  terms  of  the  contracts  with  customers,  historical  ex perience  of  discount  or  rebate  redemption,  where  relevant,  and  the  terms  of  any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve.\n\nGoodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets V aluation We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review, using either a qualitative or quantitative assessment for each of our reporting units. Where a qualitative assessment is followed, we determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists based on qualitative factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and competitive  conditions,  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  historical  financial  performance  and  significant  changes  within  the  reporting  unit.  If  the  qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. If the carrying value ex ceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we use the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global companies within the tobacco industry and a discounted cash flow model. To determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method. These discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for  forecasting  operating  cash  flows,  which  are  subject  to  changes  in  business  conditions,  such  as  volumes  and  prices,  costs  to  produce,  discount  rates  and estimated capital needs. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated, and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for all of our reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets with the exception of the three reporting units and nonamortizable intangible asset related to the Swedish Match segment for which we have performed a qualitative assessment. Based on this review, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Wellness and Healthcare reporting unit was lower than its carrying value. Consequently, PMI recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $665 million. Additionally, as a result of the impairment test of non-amortizable intangible assets, PMI recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $15 million. There was no impairment charge of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for our other reporting units. For additional information, see Item 8, Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment using a quantitative assessment for all of its reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets. As a result of this review, no impairment charges were required.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our goodwill was $16.6 billion, which is related to eleven geographical reporting units, each consisting of a group of markets with similar operating and economic characteristics, and the Wellness and Healthcare business. The estimated fair value of each of our twelve reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value as of December 31, 2024.\n\nInvestment in non-marketable equity securities -For  further  details,  see  Item  8,  Note  6. Related  Parties  -  Equity  Investments  and  Other to  our  consolidated financial statements\n\nMarketing  Costs  We  incur  certain  costs  to  support  our  products  through  programs  that  include  advertising,  marketing,  consumer  engagement  and  trade promotions. The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program.  For  volume-based  incentives  provided  to  customers,  management  continually  assesses  and  estimates,  by  customer,  the  likelihood  of  the  customer's achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made. For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola reports specific income tax payments of $2,168 million in 2021 and highlights that its effective tax rate benefits from foreign operations in countries like Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Eswatini, where tax incentive grants favorably impacted tax expense by $381 million in 2021. Procter & Gamble does not disclose a specific tax payment figure but clarifies that cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities in its cash flow presentation, aligning tax payments with core business operations. Target notes a $1.0 billion increase in income tax payments in 2021, which it directly ties to stronger operating results. These differences show that while Coca-Cola emphasizes geographic tax incentives, Procter & Gamble focuses on the classification of tax payments within financial statements, and Target links changes in tax payments to performance metrics.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other Non-Operating Income, Net\n\nOther non-operating income, net primarily includes net acquisition  and  divestiture  gains,  net  non-service  impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income and other non-operating items.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nFinancial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured  using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies,  the  U.S.  dollar  is  the  functional  currency.  Remeasurement  adjustments  for  financial  statements  in  highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings.\n\n## Cash Flow Presentation\n\nThe  Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows  are  prepared using  the  indirect  method,  which  reconciles  net  earnings  to cash flows from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at monthly exchange  rates  for  each  period.  Cash  flows  from  hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net  investment  hedges  are  classified  as  financing  activities. Realized  gains  and  losses  from  non-qualifying  derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany  financing  transactions  are  also  classified  as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest rates, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments  related  to  income  taxes  are  classified  as  operating activities.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe  Company  holds  minor  equity  investments  in  certain companies over which we exert significant influence,  but  do not  control  the  financial  and  operating  decisions.  These  are accounted  for  as  equity  method  investments.  Other  equity investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, and for which there  is  a  readily  determinable  market  value,  are  recorded  at fair value, with gains and losses recorded through net earnings. Equity  investments  without  readily  determinable  fair  values are measured at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price changes. Equity investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company also holds highly-liquid investments, primarily money market funds and time deposits. Such investments are considered cash equivalents and are included within Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable value. Product-related inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over  the  assets'  estimated  useful  lives  using  the  straight-line method.  Machinery  and  equipment  includes  office  furniture and fixtures (15-year life), computer equipment and capitalized  software  (3-  to  5-year  lives)  and  manufacturing equipment (3- to 20-year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically  reviewed  and,  when  appropriate,  changes  are made  prospectively. When  certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if  indicators  of  a  potential  impairment  are  present.  Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from  our  impairment  testing  of  indefinite-lived  intangible assets.\n\nWe have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite  lives.  We  evaluate  several  factors  to  determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic  environment  of  the  countries  in  which  the brands are sold. In addition, when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an additional impairment assessment  is  performed  and  indefinite-lived  assets  may  be adjusted to a determinable life.\n\nThe cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed,  either  on  a  straight-line  or  accelerated  basis  over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized  over  their  respective  legal  or  contractual  lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible  assets  with  determinable  lives  are  amortized  over periods  generally  ranging  from  5  to  30  years.  When  certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment  assessment  is  performed  and  remaining  lives  of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted.\n\nFor  additional  details  on  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  see Note 4.\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.",

Coca-Cola acknowledged that price increases were part of its strategy to offset rising input costs, but expressed concern that such increases might reduce sales volume and consumer willingness to pay for premium products. Philip Morris International emphasized its ability to raise prices as a key lever to improve margins and profitability, particularly in the context of economic uncertainty and adult consumer down-trading to lower-priced products.

      "answer": "CL highlights that climate change and associated regulatory pressures, such as carbon pricing and packaging regulations, are expected to increase compliance and distribution costs, potentially impacting financial performance. KO notes that the pandemic significantly increased its distribution costs due to supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and shifts in consumer demand, though it reported no material impact from temporary disruptions. MDLZ explicitly ties distribution cost increases to climate-related transition risks, including potential carbon taxes and extended producer responsibility policies, and emphasizes the need for transformational changes to meet sustainability goals. Together, these perspectives indicate that while all three companies face rising distribution costs, the drivers and strategic responses differ: CL and MDLZ focus on long-term climate and regulatory risks, while KO emphasizes near-term pandemic-related volatility and supply chain resilience.",

In addition, the increased concern over climate change is likely to result in new or additional legal and regulatory requirements intended to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment and may relate to, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., carbon pricing), alternative energy policy and additional disclosure obligations. Such additional regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition by increasing our compliance and manufacturing costs and/or negatively impacting our reputation if we are unable to, or are perceived (whether or not valid) not to, satisfy such requirements. Despite our sustainability efforts, any failure to achieve our sustainability targets, including those aimed to reduce our impact on, improve or preserve the environment, or the perception (whether or not valid) that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change, could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers, consumers, our employees and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients and ingredient transparency. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nOur business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad. Such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, packaging content, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising, sale and environmental impact. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the 'FDA'), the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nNew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities around the world review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products. While we monitor and seek to mitigate the impact of any emerging information, a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging. Additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients, to obtain regulatory approval of such products or ingredients on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business.\n\nBecause of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide anti-bribery laws, including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and laws that prohibit commercial bribery. We are also subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. (including, without limitation, those imposed by OFAC) and/or by other jurisdictions that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries, or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted. While our policies mandate compliance with these laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, findings that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations have subjected us to, and could subject us to, civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

          "chunk_text": "\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climates, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThroughout 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus continued to impact our business globally. In particular, the number of people contracting COVID19 and the preventive measures taken to contain COVID-19, including the spread of new variants, negatively impacted our unit case volume and increased our costs to manufacture and distribute our products. Our price, product and geographic mix was also negatively impacted, primarily due to unfavorable channel and product mix as consumer demand shifted to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. However, the timing and number of people receiving vaccinations, the governmental actions to reopen certain economies around the world, and the substance and pace of the economic recovery favorably impacted our business when compared to 2020. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply chain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as we continue to learn and adapt to the everchanging environment.\n\nThe Company's priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic and related business disruptions are ensuring the health and safety of our employees; supporting and making a difference in the communities we serve; keeping our brands in supply; maintaining the quality and safety of our products; and serving our customers across all channels as they adapt to the shifting demands of consumers during the pandemic.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers have been critical. We have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and processes, which include the management of any supply chain challenges. As of the date of this filing, while we have experienced some temporary supply chain disruptions, there has been no material impact, and we do not foresee a material impact, on our and our bottling partners' ability to manufacture or distribute our products.",

Physical risks include increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters and effects on water availability and quality. These impacts increase risks to the global food production and distribution system. Decreased agricultural productivity caused by climate change might limit the availability of the commodities we purchase and use. These include cocoa, which is a critical raw material for our chocolate and biscuit portfolios that is particularly sensitive to changes in climate, as well as other raw materials such as dairy, wheat, vegetable oils, sugar and nuts. Weather events such as floods, severe storms or water shortages that are partially caused or exacerbated by climate change might disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers, their suppliers, our external manufacturing partners, distributors or other business partners.\n\nTransition risks include increased focus by federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies globally regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single use plastics. New legal and regulatory requirements have increased and could continue to increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging through taxes or regulations, including payments under extended producer responsibility policies, taxes on specific packaging material types and targets to increase the use of reuse/refill delivery models. Increasing regulation of carbon taxes could also substantially increase our product supply chain and distribution costs. Concern about climate change might cause consumer preferences to switch away from products or ingredients considered to have high climate change impact and towards products that are more sustainably grown and made, and we expect to incur additional costs as we evolve our portfolio and engage in due diligence, verification and reporting in connection with our ESG and sustainability initiatives. We might not effectively address increased attention from the media, shareholders, activists and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, water use and packaging, including plastic. Those stakeholders might also have requests or proposals that are not aligned with the focus of our efforts on climate change and ESG matters. Climate change-related impacts could also reduce demand for our products. If costs for raw materials increase or availability decreases, we raise prices for our products and our competitors respond differently to those cost or availability pressures, demand for our products and our market share could suffer. We have also experienced decreased demand for chocolate during periods when temperatures are warmer.\n\nIn 2021, we announced our goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Achieving this goal will require significant transformation of our business, capital investment and the development of technology that might not currently exist. We might incur significant additional expense or be required to recognize impairment charges in connection with our efforts, and we might be unable to achieve our goal.\n\nAny or all of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet the needs of our customers, reputation, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n\n## Our retail customers are consolidating, and we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands.\n\nRetail customers, such as supermarkets, discounters, digital commerce merchants, warehouse clubs and food distributors in the European Union, the United States and other major markets, continue to consolidate, form buying alliances or be acquired by new entrants in the food retail market, resulting in fewer, larger customers. Large retail customers and customer alliances can delist our products or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs or longer payment terms. Retail customers might also adopt these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products, which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels and has increased further in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth of alternative online retail channels, such as direct-to-consumer and electronic business-tobusiness, may adversely affect our relationships with our large retail and wholesale customers.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reports 'Other, net' as a relatively small and fluctuating component of its 'Other (income) expense, net' totaling $4 million in 2021, reflecting minor adjustments compared to other larger items like amortization and restructuring charges. Coca-Cola's 'Other, net' impacts its effective tax rate by (0.8)% in 2021, indicating a modest influence on tax positioning. PepsiCo reports 'Other, net' as a consistent negative adjustment to its tax rate at (0.5)% annually from 2019\u20132021, suggesting a recurring impact on its tax liabilities. Together, these figures show that while all three companies disclose an 'Other, net' category, its role and magnitude differ: Colgate treats it as a minor operational item, while Coca-Cola and PepsiCo reflect its influence on tax outcomes, with PepsiCo showing more sustained impact.",

          "chunk_text": "\nGross margin decreased 380 basis points to 47.4% of net sales in fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin was due to:\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n- 390 basis points of increased commodity costs,\n- a  130  basis-point  decline  from  unfavorable  mix,  due primarily  to  negative  product  mix  resulting  from  the launch  and  growth  of  premium-priced  products  that  are profit-accretive  but  have  lower  than  Company-average gross margin, and\n- 40 basis points of net manufacturing cost increases, as 60 basis points of increased transportation costs and 20 basis points of product and packaging investments were partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings net of inflation and other cost increases.\n\nThese  impacts  were  partially  offset  by  a  180  basis-point increase due to higher pricing.\n\nTotal SG&amp;A decreased 4% to $20.2 billion, due to decreased overhead costs, marketing spending and other operating costs. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales decreased 240 basis points to 25.2% primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales  increase  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  a  decrease  in  overhead costs and marketing spending.\n\n- Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 120  basis  points due  primarily  to the positive  scale impacts  of  the  net  sales  increase  and,  to  a  lesser  extent, due  to  increased  media  and  production  cost  savings  and decreased media spending.\n- Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 110 basis  points  due  to  the  positive  scale  impacts  of  the  net sales increase and productivity savings.\n- Other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 10 basis points due primarily to gains from the divestiture of a minor business and sale of real estate, partially offset by increased foreign exchange transactional charges.\n\nProductivity-driven  cost  savings  delivered  70  basis  points  of benefit to SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales.\n\nOperating margin decreased 140 basis points to 22.2% due to the decrease in gross margin partially offset by the decrease in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales as discussed above.\n\n- Interest  expense  was  $439  million  in  fiscal  2022,  a decrease  of  $63  million  versus  the  prior  year  driven primarily  by  lower  average  interest  rates  on  fixed  rate debt.\n- Interest income  was  $51  million  in fiscal  2022,  an increase of $6 million versus the prior year.\n- Other  non-operating  income  increased  $484  million  to $570 million, due primarily to a prior year loss on earlydebt  extinguishment  and  a  current  year  increase  in  net non-operating  benefits  on  post-retirement  benefit  plans, partially offset by unrealized gains on equity investments in the prior year and unrealized losses on equity investments in the current year.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe effective  tax  rate  decreased  70  basis  points  to  17.8%  in 2022 due to:\n\n- a 45 basis-point decrease from higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 200 basis-point benefit in the  current  year  versus  a  155  basis-point  benefit  in  the prior year),\n- a 30 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (35 basis-point favorable impact in the current year versus a 5 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year), and\n- a 15 basis-point decrease from higher current year deductions  for  foreign-derived  intangible  income  versus prior year.\n\nThese  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  a  20  basis-point increase due to unfavorable geographic mix impacts of current year earnings.\n\n## Net Earnings\n\nOperating  income  decreased  1%  or  $0.2  billion,  to  $17.8 billion as the increase in net sales was more than fully offset by  the  decrease  in  operating  margin,  both  of  which  are discussed above.\n\nEarnings before income taxes increased 2%, or $0.4 billion, to $18.0  billion,  as  the  decrease  in  operating  income  was  more than fully offset by a prior year loss on early-debt extinguishment and lower interest expense. Net earnings increased  3%,  or  $0.4  billion,  to  $14.8  billion  due  to  the increase in earnings before income taxes and the decrease in the effective income tax rate discussed above. Foreign",

Procter & Gamble (PG) showed Total Liabilities of $71,811 million and Total Shareholders' Equity of $50,559 million, reflecting a more balanced capital structure with a lower debt-to-equity ratio. Philip Morris (PM) disclosed Total Liabilities of $74,750 million and Total Stockholders' Deficit of ($9,446) million, suggesting the highest leverage among the three, with equity in deficit.

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Mondelez (MDLZ), and Procter & Gamble (PG) differ in their composition and year-over-year trends of noncurrent assets, and what do these differences reveal about their respective balance sheet structures?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola reported noncurrent assets of $72,064 million as of December 31, 2021, showing an increase from $67,900 million in 2020. Mondelez, in contrast, reported a decrease in noncurrent assets from $72,941 million in 2020 to $71,949 million in 2021. Procter & Gamble disclosed a more specialized composition of noncurrent assets, with $765 million in noncurrent assets related to pension benefits and $4,525 million in noncurrent assets related to other retiree benefits as of 2022. These differences reflect distinct asset structures: Coca-Cola maintained a growing base of long-term assets, Mondelez experienced a reduction in noncurrent holdings, and Procter & Gamble had a significant portion of its noncurrent assets tied to post-employment benefits. The data reveals varying approaches to long-term asset management and liability structuring across these consumer staples firms.",

It is estimated that approximately 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. Annualized pre-tax savings are projected to be in the range of $90 to $110.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM\n\nThe  Company  has  historically  incurred  an  ongoing  annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before tax costs incurred under ongoing programs have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually.\n\nRestructuring  costs  incurred  consist  primarily  of  costs  to separate  employees,  asset-related  costs  to  exit  facilities  and other  costs.  Employee  separation  costs  relate  to  severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged  to  earnings  when  the  employee  accepts  the  offer. Asset-related  costs  consist  of  both  asset  write-downs  and accelerated depreciation.  Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken  out  of  service  prior  to  the  end  of  their  normal  service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations  and  technology  standardizations.  The  assetrelated  charges  will  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  future depreciation charges. Other restructuring-type charges primarily  include  asset  removal  and  termination  of  contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization.  The Company  incurred  total  restructuring  charges  of  $253  and $330  for  the  years  ended  June  30,  2022  and  2021.  Of  the charges  incurred  for  fiscal  year  2022,  $67  were  recorded  in SG&amp;A, $182 in Costs of products sold and $4 in Other nonoperating  income,  net.  Of  the  charges  incurred  in  fiscal  year 2021,  $176  were  recorded  in  SG&amp;A,  $134  in  Costs  of products sold and $20 in Other non-operating income, net.

      "answer": "Altria (MO) highlights that accrued interest on long-term debt of $410 million was included in Other Accrued Liabilities as of December 31, 2023, indicating a significant exposure to interest obligations. Target (TGT) provides a detailed breakdown showing that 'Other' liabilities amounted to $1,415 million as of February 3, 2024, though the specific components remain unspecified. Walmart (WMT) categorizes items such as interest, supply chain obligations, advertising, and utilities under Other Accrued Liabilities, suggesting a diverse set of operational commitments. Comparing these disclosures reveals that MO emphasizes interest-related liabilities, TGT reports the highest aggregate 'Other' category without itemization, and WMT shows a broad range of operational accruals, reflecting different financial and operational risk profiles.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive recorded a net tax expense of $164 million in 2023, primarily driven by current and future tax impacts related to benefit plans and currency translation adjustments. Mondelez incurred a $125 million net tax expense linked to the KDP share sale, along with a $150 million expense tied to pre-tax gains and losses on KDP marketable securities. PepsiCo reported a $2.3 billion mandatory transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with $309 million paid in 2023. These figures highlight distinct tax challenges each company faced: Colgate dealt with pension and currency impacts, Mondelez with divestiture-related tax consequences, and PepsiCo with long-term obligations from U.S. tax reform.",

Mondelez reported $16 million in North America revenue for 2023, a significant increase from a loss of $1 million in 2022. PepsiCo, on the other hand, reported $5,426 million in North America revenue for 2023, showing a decline from its 2022 performance after accounting for restructuring and acquisition-related charges.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reduced its total lease cost from $178 million in 2020 to $168 million in 2022, indicating a modest downsizing or renegotiation of lease terms. Mondelez (MDLZ) saw a significant increase in total lease cost, rising from $764 million in 2020 to $853 million in 2021, largely driven by variable lease costs which jumped from $442 million to $506 million. Procter & Gamble (PG) experienced a steady decline in total lease cost, falling from $347 million in 2020 to $309 million in 2022, suggesting a strategic reduction in leased facilities or cost optimization. Collectively, these trends show varied approaches to real estate management, with CL and PG reducing costs while MDLZ expanded its leased footprint, potentially reflecting different phases of operational restructuring or market expansion.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Costco reported 'Other Current Assets' of $1,499 million, which accounted for approximately 4.6% of its total current assets of $32,696 million. Philip Morris disclosed 'Other Current Assets' of $561 million, representing about 3.2% of its total current assets of $17,717 million. Walmart listed 'Other Current Assets' at $2,545 million, making up roughly 14.8% of its total current assets of $17,195 million. These differences may suggest varying financial strategies: Walmart's higher proportion could reflect a greater emphasis on short-term flexibility or investments, while Costco and Philip Morris appear to allocate a smaller portion of their current assets to this category, potentially indicating a more conservative or streamlined asset structure.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola, Altria, and Philip Morris differ in their accounting treatment of consumer incentive and trade promotion programs as a percentage of sales, and what does this reveal about their revenue recognition strategies in competitive consumer markets?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola notes that competitive pressures may increase marketing costs, including in-store placement, slotting, and other marketing fees, and that these costs are essential to maintaining market share and brand loyalty. Altria discloses that it expenses consumer engagement programs as incurred and includes these in marketing, administration, and research costs, while also charging certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated annual figures. Philip Morris states that it records reductions in revenue for volume-based incentives provided to customers at the time of sale, using estimates by customer of achieving specified targets, and relies on historical experience for other trade promotions. Synthesizing these perspectives, Coca-Cola emphasizes the strategic importance of marketing in a competitive environment, Altria focuses on the operational expense recognition of marketing programs, and Philip Morris highlights the use of customer-specific estimates for incentive-based revenue reductions. This reveals differing approaches to revenue recognition: Coca-Cola anticipates increased marketing costs as a necessary competitive response, Altria emphasizes expense timing and estimation, and Philip Morris focuses on customer-level performance metrics in recognizing revenue net of promotional incentives.",

For additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, including the names of certain of our significant competitors, refer to the heading 'Competition' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of sales in the global market or in regional or local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause the Company and our bottling partners to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers' ability to increase prices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost increases. Such pressures may also increase marketing costs along with in-store placement, slotting and other marketing fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e-commerce may create additional consumer price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route-to-market strategies and thus negatively affect revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing, data analytics (including artificial intelligence and machine learning) and innovation to understand and maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while strategically ex panding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.\n\n## If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.\n\nAchieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop, introduce and market new beverage products. The success of our innovation activities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends; obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property rights; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines between, retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Retailers may seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures in support of their businesses, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the CocaCola system's profitability. In addition, in developed markets, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace, while in emerging and developing markets, modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, ecommerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we and our bottling partners continue to build e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new ecommerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail and foodservice customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\n\n## If we are unable to expand our business in emerging and developing markets, our growth could be negatively affected.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Additionally, we rely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. Scarcity of, or heavy competition for, talented employees could impede our abilities in such markets. Moreover, the supply of our products in emerging and developing markets must match consumer demand for those products. Due to product price, limited purchasing power and cultural differences, our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or developing market.\n\n## If we do not successfully manage the potential negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement the most effective and efficient business model possible. Consequently, we continuously search for productivity opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take from time to time in pursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee morale, which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and give rise to",

We use certain factors to make this determination including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nSee Note 8. Investments in Equity Securities for additional information on our accounting policy for our former investment in JUUL.\n\n- Litigation Contingencies and Costs: We record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We expense litigation defense costs as incurred and include these costs in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. See Note 20. Contingencies .\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred, and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Revenue Recognition: Our businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. While our businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type, all sales contracts are similarly structured. These contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer. Our businesses satisfy all performance obligations within one year; therefore, we expense costs to obtain contracts as incurred and do not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations. There is no financing component because our businesses expect, at contract inception, that the period between when our businesses transfer product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less.\n\nOur businesses define net revenues as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. Our businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\n\nOur businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer. Our businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer. Our businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings. Our businesses record an allowance for returned goods, based principally on historical volume and return rates, which is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. We include expected payments for sales incentives in accrued marketing liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nPayment terms vary depending on product type. Our businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue, which we include in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized. PM USA primarily receives payments in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product. USSTC, Helix and NJOY receive substantially all payments within one business day of a customer obtaining control of the product. We include amounts due from customers in receivables on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n- Supplier Financing: We facilitate a voluntary supplier financing program under which participating suppliers may elect to sell receivables due from us to a third-party financial institution. Our payments are made on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier, and we have no economic interest in a supplier's sale of a receivable. All outstanding balances under the supplier financing program are recorded in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets.",

          "chunk_text": "Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, e-vapor and oral nicotine products. Our performance obligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers. PMI estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience, and these estimates are immaterial. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs for IQOS devices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized, based on a number of factors, including historical ex perience, product failure rates and warranty policies. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to  be  entitled  to  under  the  terms  of  the  contracts  with  customers,  historical  ex perience  of  discount  or  rebate  redemption,  where  relevant,  and  the  terms  of  any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve.\n\nGoodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets V aluation We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review, using either a qualitative or quantitative assessment for each of our reporting units. Where a qualitative assessment is followed, we determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists based on qualitative factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and competitive  conditions,  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  historical  financial  performance  and  significant  changes  within  the  reporting  unit.  If  the  qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. If the carrying value ex ceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we use the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global companies within the tobacco industry and a discounted cash flow model. To determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method. These discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for  forecasting  operating  cash  flows,  which  are  subject  to  changes  in  business  conditions,  such  as  volumes  and  prices,  costs  to  produce,  discount  rates  and estimated capital needs. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated, and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for all of our reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets with the exception of the three reporting units and nonamortizable intangible asset related to the Swedish Match segment for which we have performed a qualitative assessment. Based on this review, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Wellness and Healthcare reporting unit was lower than its carrying value. Consequently, PMI recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $665 million. Additionally, as a result of the impairment test of non-amortizable intangible assets, PMI recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $15 million. There was no impairment charge of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for our other reporting units. For additional information, see Item 8, Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment using a quantitative assessment for all of its reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets. As a result of this review, no impairment charges were required.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our goodwill was $16.6 billion, which is related to eleven geographical reporting units, each consisting of a group of markets with similar operating and economic characteristics, and the Wellness and Healthcare business. The estimated fair value of each of our twelve reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value as of December 31, 2024.\n\nInvestment in non-marketable equity securities -For  further  details,  see  Item  8,  Note  6. Related  Parties  -  Equity  Investments  and  Other to  our  consolidated financial statements\n\nMarketing  Costs  We  incur  certain  costs  to  support  our  products  through  programs  that  include  advertising,  marketing,  consumer  engagement  and  trade promotions. The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program.  For  volume-based  incentives  provided  to  customers,  management  continually  assesses  and  estimates,  by  customer,  the  likelihood  of  the  customer's achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made. For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reported $793 million in Other Current Assets in 2023, a slight increase from $760 million in 2022, indicating a relatively stable short-term liquidity position. Altria, on the other hand, reported $4,052 million in Other Current Assets for the parent company, significantly higher than its guarantor subsidiary's $678 million, suggesting a more centralized liquidity strategy. Philip Morris reported $1,530 million in Other Current Assets in 2023, down from $1,770 million in 2022, reflecting a reduction in short-term asset flexibility. These differences suggest that Altria maintains a more liquid short-term asset position compared to Colgate and Philip Morris, which may reflect different working capital strategies across the companies.",

MDLZ had a much larger total long-term debt of $19,296 million, with a diversified maturity profile across multiple currencies, including $9,280 million in U.S. dollar notes and $8,134 million in Euro notes. PM disclosed a significantly higher total long-term debt of $27,581 million, with a notable $7,965 million maturing 'thereafter,' indicating a more back-loaded maturity structure.

MO shows deferred income taxes impacting accumulated other comprehensive losses, with a net tax effect of $9 million in 2023, suggesting a smaller or offsetting tax liability. PM reports $2,335 million in deferred income taxes as part of its long-term liabilities, showing an increase from 2022.

      "answer": "COST views supercenters as key competitors in a highly competitive retail environment, emphasizing the need to differentiate through pricing, selection, and digital innovation. MDLZ sells its snack products to supercenters as part of a broad distribution strategy that includes multiple retail formats, highlighting the importance of these channels in reaching consumers. WMT operates supercenters as a core store format, with an average size of 178,000 square feet, indicating a strategic focus on combining general merchandise and grocery under one roof. Together, these perspectives show that while COST competes directly with supercenters, MDLZ supplies them, and WMT owns and operates them, revealing complementary but distinct roles in the same retail ecosystem.",

Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negativ ely impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core v alues. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prev ailing wage rates, union relations and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and inv est significant resources in training and motiv ating them. T here is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\n\nClaims for  employee health care benefits, workers' compensation, general liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and  officers'  liability,  v ehicle  liability, inv entory  loss,  and  other  exposures  are  funded  predominantly  through  self-insurance.  Insurance  cov erage  is  maintained  for  certain  risks  to  limit exposures arising from v ery large losses. T he types and amounts of insurance may v ary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or ev ents, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance cov erage could hav e an adv erse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough we maintain specific cov erages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any  physical  damage  to,  or  the  destruction  of,  any  warehouses,  depots,  manufacturing  or  home  office  facilities,  loss  or  spoilage  of  inv entory,  and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.\n\n## Market and Other External Risks\n\nWe  face  strong  competition  from  other  retailers  and  warehouse  club  operators,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe retail business is highly competitiv e. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and serv ices and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, online retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete v igorously and in a v ariety of ways, including pricing,  selection  and  av ailability,  serv ices,  location,  conv enience,  store  hours,  and  the  attractiv eness  and  ease  of  use  of  websites  and  mobile applications. The ev olution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improv ed the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition.

We also sell products directly to businesses and consumers through v arious pure play e-retail platforms, retailer digital platforms, our direct-to-consumer websites and social media platforms. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net rev enues from continuing operations in 2024. For a discussion of long-term demographics, consumer trends and demand, refer to our Financial Outlook within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\n## Distribution and Marketing\n\nOur  product  distribution  network  encompasses  direct  store  deliv ery,  company-owned  and  satellite  warehouses,  distribution  centers,  third  party distributors and other facilities. Additionally, we lev erage the serv ices of independent sales offices and agents in v arious international locations. T hrough our global digital commerce organization and capabilities, we pursue online growth with partners in key markets around the world, including both pure etailers and omni-channel retailers. We continue to inv est in adv ertising and consumer promotions, talent and digital capabilities. Our digital commerce channel strategies play a critical role in our ambition to be the global leader in snacking.\n\nOur marketing initiativ es are categorized in three principal sets of activ ities: (i) consumer marketing and adv ertising including digital and social media, onair , print, outdoor and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentiv es such as coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers.\n\n## Research, Development and Innovation\n\nOur  innov ation  and  new  product  dev elopment  objectiv es  include  continuous  improv ement  in  food  safety  and  quality,  growth  through  new  products, superior  consumer satisfaction  and  reduced  production  costs.  We  hav e  established  a  robust  framework  for  innov ation  to  driv e  a  technology  pipeline supporting the creation of new product bundles across short-, medium- and long-term horizons. These bundles enhance our portfolio to address ev olv ing consumer preferences and market trends, nutritional  needs  as  well  as  reduce  our  env ironmental  impact.  We  work  to  test  and  learn  new  ideas  and implement successful ones into other areas of our business. T o driv e growth, creativ ity, greater effectiv eness, improv ed efficiency and accelerated project deliv ery, we are focusing our technical research and dev elopment resources at technical centers around the globe.\n\nMindful snacking and sustainability are a significant focus of our current research and dev elopment initiativ es. We work to introduce new v arieties of our core products, including new taste or nutrition profiles that cater to ev olv ing consumer preferences, such as the launch in the UK of Cadbury Dairy Milk &amp; MORE , a multi-dimensional tablet designed to deliv er a richer, more indulgent eating experience, zero-sugar Oreo's in China and reduced sugar candies under The  Natural  Confectionary  Company brand  in Australia.  We  continue  to  expand  our  portfolio  of  cakes  and  pastries  in  new  markets  and  with updated formats including Milka brownies a nd Oreo cakes .\n\nWe  also  hav e  a  dedicated  innov ation  and  v enture  hub,  SnackFutures,  specifically  tailored  to  lev erage  emerging  consumer  trends  and  growth opportunities in mindful snacking. T he core objectiv es of this group are aligned with three key strategic areas: inv ent new brands and businesses, inv est in early-stage entrepreneurs and amplify SnackFutures' influence through the CoLab start-up engagement and mentoring programs built to equip startups with essential tools, technologies and expertise that can help them learn, grow and succeed.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe operate in highly competitiv e markets that are comprised of global, regional and local competitors, including new start-up brands and businesses. Some competitors have different profit objectiv es and inv estment time horizons than we do and therefore may approach pricing and promotional decisions differently.  We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, serv ice, product innov ation, taste, conv enience, nutritional v alue, the ability  to  identify  and  satisfy  consumer  preferences,  effectiv eness  of  our  digital  and  other  sales  and  marketing  strategies,  routes  to  market  and distribution  networks,  promotional  activ ities  and  price.

      "answer": "MDLZ highlights that 73.4% of its 2023 net revenues were generated outside the U.S., making it highly exposed to global macroeconomic conditions, including rising transportation costs. PM notes that increasing inflationary pressures have led to significant increases in transportation costs, which it attempts to mitigate through pricing actions. WMT specifically cites increased transportation costs due to fuel prices and supply chain disruptions, which affect its delivery of goods to distribution centers and stores. Together, these perspectives indicate that while all three companies face rising transportation costs, their operational structures and geographic exposures lead to different risk profiles and mitigation strategies.",

Coca-Cola (KO) referenced Note 14 for detailed information on its pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities, indicating transparency through detailed disclosures in the footnotes. PepsiCo (PEP) quantified its pension liabilities at $167 million in 2023 and $189 million in 2022, showing a reduction in this liability over time.

Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n## Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nNote 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Altria's consolidated financial statements. In most instances, Altria must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under GAAP.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in Altria's consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between Altria's estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of Altria's consolidated financial statements:\n\n- Revenue Recognition: Altria's businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. Net revenues are defined as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. Altria's businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\n\nAltria's businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. Expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nFor further discussion, see Note 3. Revenues from Contracts with Customers to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n\n- Depreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation: Altria depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes its definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\n\nAltria reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. These analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If Altria determines that an impairment exists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. Altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\n\nAltria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require Altria to perform an interim review. Altria has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, Altria will perform a single step quantitative impairment test. Additionally, Altria has the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit, but is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value in the period identified.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) aims to achieve organic sales growth through innovation, expanding into higher-growth channels and markets, and improving brand health, despite challenges from foreign exchange and competitive pressures. Target (TGT) ties executive compensation to sales growth as part of a multi-metric performance share unit plan, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $164.92 per unit in 2024, indicating that sales growth is a key performance benchmark for long-term incentives. Walmart (WMT) notes that increased sales growth contributed to a rise in the working capital deficit due to higher inventories and receivables, suggesting that sales growth directly impacts operational liquidity and reinvestment capacity. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies view sales growth as a strategic lever, they operationalize it differently\u2014through innovation and brand strength (CL), executive incentives (TGT), and working capital dynamics (WMT).",

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nGiven that approximately two-thirds of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations, particularly in Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye, which are considered hyper-inflationary economies. Effective January 1, 2025, we designated Nigeria as a hyper-inflationary economy. Consequently, the functional currency for our Nigerian subsidiary will be the U.S. dollar and the impact of all future Nigerian currency fluctuations will be recorded in income. However, this designation is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed above, we continue to experience higher raw and packaging material costs, including the impact of transactional foreign exchange. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as our funding-the-growth and revenue growth management initiatives, in the current environment it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. Should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results.\n\nWhile the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors (including private label competitors), from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion.\n\nWe have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory destocking, fulfillment requirements, technology-aided category pricing pressures, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. In addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of eCommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online, including to compare prices and product availability) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. We are building and scaling our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, data, analytics and artificial intelligence and investing behind higher growth businesses. The substantial growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers.\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of geopolitical events and tensions, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, tensions between China and Taiwan and the developments in trade relations, and the challenging market conditions discussed above, on our business and the related uncertainties and risks. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of these events and conditions, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of their impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. For more information about factors that could impact our business, see 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain, dedicated and diverse global team and focused business strategy. Our strategy is based on delivering consistent compounded earnings per share growth through driving organic sales growth, operational efficiencies and leveraging the strength of our balance sheet. We believe increased household penetration and improved brand health are the keys to consistent organic sales growth and aim to achieve these through science-led, core and premium innovation, pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments and expanding in faster-growing channels and markets. We aim to deliver margin expansion and cash flow growth through operating leverage and efficiency. We also seek to lead in the development of human capital and to maximize our Sustainability &amp; Social Impact Strategy. Our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to profitability and driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges we face and increase shareholder value over time.",

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2025, when compared to the previous fiscal year, is primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating income and lapping the payment of accrued opioid legal charges in the prior year, partially offset by increased inventory purchases. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2024, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to higher cash provided by operating income, as well as timing of certain payments and strategic inventory management as part of working capital initiatives, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $9.0 billion and $9.9 billion as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $17.1 billion and $15.5 billion as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in our working capital deficit is primarily driven by an increase in short-term borrowings for general corporate purposes and accounts payable due to timing of payments, partially offset by increased inventories and receivables related to higher sales growth. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.\n\nWe use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Under current law, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax , but may incur other tax es such as withholding or state tax es. We do not ex pect current local laws, or other ex isting limitations on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025 and 2024, cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders.\n\n## Net Cash Used in Investing Activities\n\n",

      "question": "How do Costco, Altria, and Walmart each characterize changes in their net deferred tax liabilities in 2024, and what do these changes suggest about their respective tax planning strategies and financial positioning?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Costco reported a decrease in its net deferred tax liabilities from $304 million to $221 million, indicating a reduction in future tax obligations, potentially due to changes in asset timing or valuation allowances. Altria, on the other hand, saw an increase in its net deferred tax liabilities from $2,771 million to $3,744 million, signaling growing future tax burdens, possibly due to asset impairments or changes in international tax positions. Walmart reported a decline in its net deferred tax liabilities from $5,585 million to $5,271 million, suggesting a modest improvement in its deferred tax position, likely due to adjustments in asset depreciation or lease liabilities. These differing trends reflect varied tax planning approaches and financial strategies among the three firms.",

Procter & Gamble (PG) notes that a downgrade in its credit rating or disruptions in the credit markets could significantly increase its cost of capital and impair access to capital markets. Philip Morris (PM) states that inflationary pressures have led to increased costs of capital due to interest rate hikes, which could negatively affect profitability and financial flexibility.

      "answer": "MDLZ reported actuarial losses of $63 million for U.S. plans and $269 million for non-U.S. plans in 2021, driven by changes in assumptions and market conditions. MO attributed its actuarial (gains) losses primarily to changes in discount rates and mortality assumptions, with a notable $432 million reduction in postretirement obligation due to plan amendments in 2021. PM recognizes actuarial gains and losses using the corridor approach, deferring their impact through other comprehensive earnings, which indicates a more gradual recognition of market and assumption-driven volatility. Together, these approaches show varying sensitivities to actuarial assumptions and differing accounting treatments that affect financial reporting and funded status.",

(1)\n\nThe table above presents the projected benefit obligation for Altria's pension plans. The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, for the pension plans was $8.2 billion and $9.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nActuarial (gains) losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 for the pension and postretirement plans were due primarily to changes in the discount rate. Actuarial (gains) losses for the pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2021 were further impacted by changes to mortality rate assumptions.\n\nPlan amendments for the postretirement plans for the year ended December 31, 2021 included several plan changes announced in June 2021 to Altria's salaried retiree healthcare plans, primarily changing its post-age 65 coverage to a private medicare marketplace. These amendments triggered a plan remeasurement in June 2021, resulting in a reduction of $432 million (including discount rate impact and other changes) to the postretirement obligation in the second quarter of 2021 and a corresponding reduction to its accumulated other comprehensive losses.\n\nFor pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2021, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $176 million and $0 million, respectively. For pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2020, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $393 million and $149 million, respectively.\n\nFor pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2021, the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $227 million and $0 million, respectively. For pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $9,324 million and $8,750 million, respectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were in excess of plan assets for all postretirement plans.",

          "chunk_text": "## Note 2.\n\n## Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated primarily over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years, and buildings and building improvements primarily over periods up to 40 years.\n\n## Employee benefit plans\n\nPMI  provides  a  range  of  benefits  to  its  employees  and  retired  employees,  including  pensions,  postretirement  health  care  and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). PMI records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified under U.S.  GAAP. PMI recognizes the funded status of its  defined  pension  and  postretirement  plans  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the benefit obligation. PMI measures the plan assets and liabilities at the end of the fiscal year. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For  the  postretirement  health  care  plans,  the  benefit  obligation  is  the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation. Any  plan  with  an overfunded status is recognized as an asset, and any plan with an underfunded status is recognized as a liability. Any gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs are recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred taxes. PMI elects to recognize actuarial gains/(losses) using the corridor approach.\n\n## Fair value measurements\n\nPMI follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. The guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The guidance describes three levels of input that may be used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nPMI translates the results of operations of its subsidiaries and affiliates using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholders' (deficit) equity. In addition, some of PMI's subsidiaries have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their  functional  currencies,  and  to  the  extent  those  are  not  designated  as  net  investment  hedges,  these  assets  and  liabilities  generate transaction gains and losses when translated into their respective functional currencies.\n\n## Goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation\n\nPMI tests goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review. PMI performs its annual impairment analysis in the second quarter of each year. The impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) disclosed that contract termination costs were part of its 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, making up 15% of total pretax charges, with these costs primarily stemming from implementation-related charges tied to exit activities and new strategic implementations. PepsiCo (PEP) included contract termination costs as part of its broader 2019 Productivity Plan and other initiatives, with such costs contributing to a total pre-tax charge of $6.15 billion, including $5.1 billion in cash expenditures. Philip Morris International (PM) specifically quantified $78 million in contract termination costs related to supplier agreements as part of its 2023 e-vapor manufacturing restructuring, including $21 million in finance lease terminations. The comparative analysis reveals that while all three companies incurred contract termination costs in the context of operational restructuring, the scale and strategic focus of these initiatives differ significantly, with PM focusing on outsourcing e-vapor manufacturing, PEP on a multi-year global productivity plan, and CL on implementation of new strategies post-exit activities.",

Definite-life  intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of  trademarks,  customer-related intangibles, process technology, licenses and non-compete agreements.\n\nAmortization expense for intangible assets was $153 million in 2024, $151 million in 2023 and $132 million in 2022. For the next fiv e years, we estimate annual amortization expense of approximately $135 million in 2025, $110 million in 2026, $90 million in 2027 and $85 million in 2028 and 2029 (reflecting December 31, 2024 exchange rates).\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were no goodwill impairments and each of our reporting units had sufficient fair v alue in excess of its carrying v alue. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific v aluation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair v alues of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.\n\nIn 2024, we recorded $153 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to two biscuit brands in the Europe segment, one biscuit brand in the AMEA segment and one candy and one biscuit brand in the Latin America segment. We identified thirteen brands, as part of our annual test, that each had a fair v alue in excess of book v alue of 10% or less. T he aggregate v alue of the thirteen brands was $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2024. We believ e our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to not be impaired, but if plans to grow brand rev enue and earnings, and expand margin are not met or specific v aluation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future.\n\nIn 2023, we recorded $26 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a chocolate brand in North America and a biscuit brand in Europe. In 2022, we recorded $101 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to two biscuit brands in AMEA.",

We estimate that our 2025 effective tax rate will be approximately 22.5% to 23.5%, excluding discrete tax  events. For further details, see Item 8, Note 12. Income Taxes .\n\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $2,316 million related to our RBH equity investment in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.\n\nIncome from equity investments and securities, net, increased by $480 million or over 100%, primarily driven by a favorable fair value adjustment for our equity security investments in India and Sri Lanka. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other .\n\nNet earnings attributable to PMI of $7.1 billion decreased by $756 million or 9.7%. This decrease was due primarily to the impairment related to the RBH equity investment and a higher effective tax rate, partly offset by higher operating income and higher income from equity investments and securities. Basic earnings per share of $4.53 decreased by 9.8%. Diluted EPS of $4.52 decreased by 10.0%. Excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.38, diluted EPS decreased by 2.4%.\n\n## 2023 compared with 2022\n\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023, with the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Part II, Item 7.

PepsiCo recorded $86 million in net tax expense in 2022 related to the TCJ Act and maintains a $2.3 billion liability for the mandatory transition tax, expecting to pay $579 million in 2024.

      "answer": "In 2021, MDLZ reported $89 million in amortization of right-of-use assets and $7 million in interest on lease liabilities under finance leases. PM reported $54 million in amortization and $1 million in interest. WMT, on the other hand, reported $583 million in amortization and $298 million in interest on lease obligations. This suggests that WMT has a significantly larger finance lease burden compared to MDLZ and PM, which may reflect differences in asset financing strategies across the three companies.",

These items were $64, $46 and $84 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to gov ernment agencies and member returns. The Company reserv es for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recov ery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectiv ely, in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods.  The  Company also prov ides  expanded  products  and  serv ices  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  T he  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its transactions and recognizes rev enue on a gross basis.  The  Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or serv ice before it is transferred to the member. The majority of rev enue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Rev enue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, rev enue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  rev enue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  ov er  the  one-year  membership  period.  Deferred membership fees at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $2,501 and $2,337.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executiv e members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum v alue, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of nonredemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the net reduction in sales was $2,804, $2,576, and $2,307.\n\nThe Company sells and otherwise prov ides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for  outstanding  shop  card  balances  as  a  shop  card  liability,  net  of  estimated  breakage.  Shop  card  liabilities  are  included  in  other  current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCitibank, N.A. is the exclusiv e issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receiv es v arious forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receiv e, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries.\n\n## Merchandise Costs\n\nMerchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inv entory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company's depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, and are reduced by v endor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses.",

          "chunk_text": "We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.\n\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Refer to Note 3.\n\n## Advertising Costs\n\nOur Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures are expensed in the annual period in which the expenditure is incurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income were $5 billion, $5 billion and $4 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, advertising and production costs of $25 million and $43 million, respectively, were primarily recorded in the line item prepaid ex penses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Shipping and Handling Costs\n\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers are also included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods sold by our consolidated bottlers to our customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative ex penses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to fulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised to customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are accrued.\n\n## Sales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes\n\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf of its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were collected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales, inventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Net Income Per Share\n\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were ex ercised. We ex cluded 3 million, 8 million and 8 million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash equivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNOTE 1\n\n## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter &amp; Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior  quality  and  value.  Our  products  are  sold  in  about 180  countries  and  territories  primarily  through  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  consumers.  We  have  on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.\n\n## Use of E stimates\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items,  consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax  positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although  management  does  not  generally  believe  such  differences  would  materially  affect  the  financial  statements  in  any  individual  year.  However,  regarding ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer.\n\nTrade  promotions,  consisting  primarily  of  customer  pricing  allowances,  merchandising  funds  and  consumer  coupons,  are  offered  through  various  programs  to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative E xpense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG &amp;A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include television, print, radio, digital and in-store advertising ex penses and were $9.6 billion in 2024, $8.0 billion in 2023 and $7.9 billion in 2022. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SG&amp;A include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.\n\n## Other Non-Operating Income, Net\n\nOther non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, net non-service impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income, accumulated foreign currency translation losses and other non-operating items.\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherw ise specified.",

MO implemented selective pricing actions in 2023, including a $0.09 per can increase on its Copenhagen, Red Seal, and Skoal brands, while decreasing prices on select Husky brands by $0.18 per can, indicating a segmented pricing strategy. PG noted that pricing actions were used to offset inflationary cost increases, though it acknowledged the potential negative impact on product consumption.

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ) reported a $495 million positive impact from pension and other benefit plans on other comprehensive earnings in 2021, contributing to a total comprehensive earnings figure of $4,364 million. Altria (MO) had a more complex relationship with benefit plans, showing a $1,612 million accumulated loss in benefit plans by the end of 2021, though the company also experienced a $961 million gain in benefit plans during the year before reclassifications and tax adjustments. Philip Morris (PM) did not provide specific numerical impacts of benefit plans in its disclosures, but it referenced the importance of these plans in its consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings and linked them to broader financial instruments and reclassifications. The differences in magnitude and direction of impact suggest that benefit plans contribute varying degrees of volatility to comprehensive earnings across the sector, with MO experiencing larger swings and MDLZ showing a more isolated positive contribution, while PM's disclosures emphasize structural complexity rather than specific financial impacts.",

Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. (\"Altria\") and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and Philip Morris USA Inc. (\"PM USA\"), a  U.S.  tobacco  subsidiary  of Altria,  for  tobacco  product  claims  based  in  substantial  part  on  products  manufactured  by  PMI  or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.\n\nIt  is  possible  that  there  could  be  adverse  developments  in  pending  cases  against  us  and  our  subsidiaries.  An  unfavorable  outcome  or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.\n\nDamages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada and Nigeria, range into the billions  of  U.S.  dollars.  The  variability  in  pleadings  in  multiple  jurisdictions,  together  with  the  actual  experience  of  management  in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, price increases had distinct effects across MO, PG, and PM. For MO, significant price increases were necessary to offset rising costs and settlement payments, but this led to increased competition from lower-priced brands and potential down-trading by consumers, threatening market share and shipment volumes. PG benefited from price increases in its Personal Health Care segment, where higher pricing contributed to a high-teens increase in net sales and improved market share, despite supply chain challenges. In contrast, PM faced negative consequences from price increases in certain international markets, particularly Canada, where adult smokers switched to e-vapor products, contributing to a decline in total market size and market share. Collectively, these dynamics show that while price increases can help offset cost pressures, their impact varies significantly depending on consumer sensitivity, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment.",

In addition, our subsidiaries and investees may incur increased costs and otherwise be negatively affected if significant portions of their respective workforces (or the workforces within their respective distribution or supply chains) are unable to work or work effectively, including because of illness, unavailability of personal protective equipment, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak (including new variants), increases in the number of cases in future periods, and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate the public health effects. We cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our or our investees' future financial or operational results, but the impact could be material over time. See the risks below related to extended disruptions at a facility, of a distributor or in service by a service provider and the risks related to our investments in JUUL, ABI and Cronos and the earnings from and carrying value of those investments. For further discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our tobacco operating companies and investees, see Executive Summary - COVID-19 Pandemic in Item 7.\n\nAltria's tobacco businesses face significant competition (including across categories) and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria, or the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies and on Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\nEach of Altria's tobacco operating companies operates in highly competitive tobacco categories. This competition also exists across categories as adult tobacco consumer preferences evolve. Significant methods of competition include product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging, distribution and promotional activities. This highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability, market share (including as a result of down-trading to lower-priced competitive brands) and shipment volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria. See Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Summary in Item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. Growth of the e-vapor product category and other innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, has further contributed to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and in the consumption levels and sales volumes of other tobacco products, including MST. In addition, growth of unregulated synthetic nicotine products, which may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions (including marketing restrictions and FDA pre-marketing requirements) as the tobacco-derived e-vapor and oral nicotine products of Altria's tobacco operating companies and JUUL, could negatively impact the growth of e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products. Continued growth in these categories could have a material adverse impact on the business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies if they are unable to compete effectively (directly or through Altria's investments) in these innovative product categories, which could also negatively impact Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\nPM USA also faces competition from lower-priced brands sold by certain United States and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the United States and, as such, are not required to make annual settlement payments as required by the parties to the settlements. These settlement payments are significant for PM USA, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation in Item 7. These settlements, among other factors, resulted in substantial cigarette price increases to help cover the cost of the settlement payments. Manufacturers not party to the settlements are subject to state escrow legislation requiring escrow deposits. Such manufacturers may avoid these escrow obligations by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers' cigarettes sold in such states. Additional competition has resulted from diversion into the United States market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the United States, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes, and imports of foreign lower-priced brands.\n\nAltria and its tobacco operating companies may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences, responding to changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Altria or the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies.\n\nEach of our tobacco operating companies is subject to intense competition and changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences. To be successful, they must continue to:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new and evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences;\n- develop, manufacture, market and distribute new and innovative products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers (including, where appropriate, through arrangements with, or investments in, third parties);\n- improve productivity; and\n- protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases.",

          "chunk_text": "- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 2.98% and 2.65% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 3.06%, and 2.88% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. The assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 5.70% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rate of return.\n\nAverage annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 3%, 8%, 8%, 6% and 7%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans' investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 76% in fixed income securities, 21% in equity securities and 3% in real estate and other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $18. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans and U.S. other retiree benefit plan would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $2 and $10, respectively. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2021, and 2020. Refer to Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's pension and other postretirement plans.\n\n- The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits (other than the discount rate noted above) is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 6.00% for 2022, declining to 4.75% by 2026 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. The effect on the total of service cost and interest costs components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $11.\n- The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton ('Black-Scholes') option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2021 was $11.11. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 4%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%. The Company uses a MonteCarlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the date of grant. The Monte-Carlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the Black-Scholes model.\n- Goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.",

For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the countries.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) explains that variable lease costs include items like utilities, common area maintenance, property taxes, and insurance, which are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as incurred. Costco (COST) quantifies its variable lease costs at $157 million in 2022, showing an upward trend from $151 million in 2021 and $87 million in 2020. Target (TGT) notes that in 2022 (by implication, consistent with prior years), variable and short-term lease costs were $64 million in 2021 and $44 million in 2020, with insignificant amounts in 2019.

      "answer": "MDLZ updated its stock incentive plan in 2024, authorizing 50.7 million shares under the new plan, indicating a focus on employee incentives and long-term equity-based compensation. MO, with 23.99 million shares reserved for stock-based awards as of year-end 2024, shows a more measured approach to equity compensation, possibly balanced against its significant dividend and share repurchase activities, including a $3.4 billion share repurchase program in early 2024. WMT, by contrast, executed a 3-for-1 stock split with a corresponding increase in authorized shares, signaling a structural adjustment to maintain liquidity and potentially facilitate broader shareholder participation, rather than focusing on employee compensation or share buybacks.

          "chunk_text": "## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## General\n\nWalmart Inc. (\"Walmart\" or the \"Company\") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to helping people around the world save money and live better by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers.\n\nThe Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\"), January 31, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\") and January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2025 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Common Stock Split\n\nOn February 23, 2024, the Company effected a 3-for-1 forward split of its common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of authorized shares. All share and per share information, including share based compensation, has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of $0.10 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from capital in ex cess of par value to common stock.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n\nThe Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $9.0 billion and $9.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, approximately 62% and 60% were held outside of the U.S., respectively. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations.\n\nThe Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025 and 2024, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws, other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders.\n\n## Walmart Inc.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements",

MDLZ states that the fair value of its long-term debt is determined using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 valuation data) for publicly traded obligations and approximates the amounts recorded on its consolidated balance sheets. MO highlights that the fair value of its long-term debt, which is entirely fixed-rate, is subject to fluctuations primarily due to changes in market interest rates, and it provides sensitivity analysis showing how a 1% change in rates would impact fair value. Together, these disclosures indicate varying debt structures and valuation approaches, with COST using multiple valuation levels, MDLZ relying on active market pricing, and MO emphasizing interest rate sensitivity.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reported $535 million in pension-related noncurrent liabilities as of the end of its fiscal year, reflecting an increase from the prior year and driven by actuarial losses and an ERISA litigation matter. Coca-Cola, while disclosing $33,989 million in total noncurrent liabilities, does not break down pension-specific obligations, suggesting a broader liability structure that may include other long-term commitments. Procter & Gamble disclosed $2,884 million in pension-related noncurrent liabilities, showing a decrease from the prior year and indicating a relatively stronger funded status compared to Colgate. These differences suggest that Colgate faces more immediate pension funding pressures, while Procter & Gamble appears to have more strategic flexibility due to its larger asset base relative to obligations. Coca-Cola\u2019s lack of pension-specific disclosure implies a potentially different liability composition that may not weigh as heavily on pension obligations compared to the other two companies.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) reports a net deferred tax liability related to benefit plans of $527 million in 2021, indicating a growing tax obligation tied to these plans. Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ) shows a pension and benefit plan-related component of $495 million in its 2021 other comprehensive earnings, suggesting a positive non-tax impact on equity from benefit plan adjustments. Altria (MO) discloses accumulated losses tied to benefit plans of $1,612 million by the end of 2021, reflecting a significant negative impact on equity. Together, these figures highlight how each company experiences and reports the financial implications of benefit plans differently\u2014KO through deferred tax liabilities, MDLZ through comprehensive earnings, and MO through accumulated losses\u2014revealing varied exposures and accounting treatments.",

      "question": "How did the impact of foreign exchange movements on financial performance differ across PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, and Philip Morris International in 2023, and what does this reveal about their respective exposure and reporting practices?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo experienced a favorable 9-percentage-point impact from foreign exchange on net revenue growth in Latin America, contributing to a 19% increase in regional net revenue. Procter & Gamble reported a negative 2-percentage-point impact from foreign exchange on total company net sales growth, affecting several business segments including Beauty and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Meanwhile, Philip Morris International recorded a $149 million foreign exchange-related deferred income tax asset in 2023, contrasting with a $175 million deferred tax liability in 2022, indicating a shift in tax positioning due to currency movements. These differences reveal varying degrees of exposure and distinct financial reporting treatments of foreign exchange impacts across the three firms.",

      "question": "How did KO, MO, and PM each disclose their approaches to managing marketing costs in their 2023 filings, and what do these disclosures reveal about their distinct strategic responses to competitive and operational pressures?",
      "answer": "In their 2023 filings, KO, MO, and PM each disclosed distinct approaches to managing marketing costs, shaped by their unique competitive and operational environments. KO explicitly linked rising marketing costs to competitive pressures, noting that increased competition could cause the company and its bottling partners to increase marketing expenditures, including in-store placement, slotting, and other marketing fees. This reflects a strategic emphasis on maintaining market share in the face of aggressive competition, especially in the evolving e-commerce landscape. MO, on the other hand, categorized marketing costs under 'marketing, administration and research costs' and described them as part of routine promotional activities such as consumer incentives, trade promotions, and event marketing. These costs were expensed as incurred or estimated as a percentage of sales, indicating a more standardized and integrated approach to marketing spend without direct linkage to external pressures like geopolitical events. PM reported a significant increase in marketing, administration, and research costs, attributing part of this rise to inflationary impacts, particularly wages, and lower commercial investments in the prior year period. Additionally, PM noted a $80 million charge related to the termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East, which may have disrupted regional marketing strategies. This suggests a more volatile and event-driven approach to marketing cost management influenced by geopolitical instability and restructuring. Collectively, these disclosures show KO responding to competitive intensity, MO maintaining a steady and policy-driven marketing cost structure, and PM navigating inflation and geopolitical disruptions that directly impacted their marketing and administrative spending.",

PEP includes overhead costs as part of cost of sales, specifically mentioning that plant overhead is a component of manufacturing costs, and emphasizes cost control through operational efficiency and strategic sourcing. PG allocates overhead costs under Corporate, which includes charges related to Enterprise Markets, Global Business Services, and Corporate Functions, indicating a centralized cost structure.

      "answer": "PM's financial planning must account for significant pension-related tax sensitivities, where a 50-basis-point change in discount rate could alter pension expense by over $50 million, requiring careful long-term liability management. TGT, with effective tax rates of 22.2% and 21.9% in recent periods, demonstrates relative tax rate stability, enabling more predictable financial forecasting and capital allocation decisions. WMT explicitly flags changes in effective tax rates as a risk factor that could materially affect its financial performance, indicating a need for greater contingency planning and sensitivity analysis in its financial modeling. Together, these perspectives reveal differing degrees of tax risk exposure and corresponding strategic financial planning approaches across the three consumer staples firms.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2025 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $166 million as compared with approximately $158 million in 2024, ex cluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs. The anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses of $45 million, coupled with higher service cost of $17 million, partially offset by higher expected return on assets of $20 million, coupled with lower interest cost of $30 million and other movements of $4 million.\n\nWeighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans. A fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2025 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $56 million, and a fifty-basispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2025 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $46 million. Similarly, a fifty-basis-point decrease (increase) in the ex pected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our 2025 pension expense by approximately $44 million.\n\nIncome T axes Income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the United States, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax  audits. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes, we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax  liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to ex pense would generally result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax  benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\nWe are required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income. If we determine, using all available evidence, that we do not reach the more likely than not threshold for recovery, a valuation allowance is recorded.  Significant judgment is required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including estimates of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions and the feasibility of on-going tax planning strategies, as applicable.\n\nThe effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our full-year geographic earnings mix projections. Changes in currency exchange rates, earnings mix by taxing  jurisdiction  or  future  regulatory  developments  may  have  an  impact  on  the  effective  tax   rates. Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  income  tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 12. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nHedging As discussed below in 'Market Risk,' we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings. For our other derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting, gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other",

Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.\n\nOne or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the type, volume and mix of services we provide and the reimbursement we receive for health and wellness services rendered. Any of these developments could, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\n## Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our ex isting stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous ex ternal factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully ex ecute organizational changes, including our enterprise strategy and management transitions within our senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. We compete for talent with other retail and non-retail businesses, including, for ex ample, technology, health and wellness and fintech businesses, and invest significant resources in training and motivating our associates. Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including senior management and executive levels, could result in increased associate costs or make it more difficult to recruit and retain associates. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised or novel interpretations of ex isting labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws, including those related to worker classification, are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Illegal or inappropriate activ ity of our independent contractors or third-party serv ice prov iders could expose us to liability and adv ersely affect our business, reputation and financial performance.\n\nWe are subject to risks related to our engagement of independent contractors or other third-party service providers. The qualification processes and background checks we utilize when engaging independent contractors may not reveal all potentially relevant information, including accurate worker authorization information and criminal history. If these independent contractors engage in misconduct, consumers may not consider our goods and services safe, and we may receive negative press coverage. Further, we have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud with respect to unauthorized uses of another person's identity and use of fraudulent identification documents. Any physical injury, loss of life, fraud, property and/or financial damage caused by our independent contractors or third-party service providers could adversely affect our business reputation, which could negatively affect demand for our goods and services, lead to increased regulatory or litigation ex posure and adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\n\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market ex pectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, advertising and other higher-margin initiatives (which are ex pected to help drive our operating income growth at a rate faster than net sales over the long term), capital ex penditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of our performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\n\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and ex penses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using ex change rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.",

These items were $64, $46 and $84 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to gov ernment agencies and member returns. The Company reserv es for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recov ery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectiv ely, in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods.  The  Company also prov ides  expanded  products  and  serv ices  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  T he  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its transactions and recognizes rev enue on a gross basis.  The  Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or serv ice before it is transferred to the member. The majority of rev enue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Rev enue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, rev enue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  rev enue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  ov er  the  one-year  membership  period.  Deferred membership fees at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $2,501 and $2,337.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executiv e members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum v alue, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of nonredemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the net reduction in sales was $2,804, $2,576, and $2,307.\n\nThe Company sells and otherwise prov ides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for  outstanding  shop  card  balances  as  a  shop  card  liability,  net  of  estimated  breakage.  Shop  card  liabilities  are  included  in  other  current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCitibank, N.A. is the exclusiv e issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receiv es v arious forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receiv e, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries.\n\n## Merchandise Costs\n\nMerchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inv entory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company's depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, and are reduced by v endor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses.",

          "chunk_text": "We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.\n\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Refer to Note 3.\n\n## Advertising Costs\n\nOur Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures are expensed in the annual period in which the expenditure is incurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income were $5 billion, $5 billion and $4 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, advertising and production costs of $25 million and $43 million, respectively, were primarily recorded in the line item prepaid ex penses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Shipping and Handling Costs\n\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers are also included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods sold by our consolidated bottlers to our customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative ex penses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to fulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised to customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are accrued.\n\n## Sales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes\n\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf of its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were collected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales, inventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Net Income Per Share\n\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were ex ercised. We ex cluded 3 million, 8 million and 8 million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash equivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  are  provided  on  all  earnings  for  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States. These  provisions,  as  well  as  state  and  local  income  tax   provisions,  are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the  provision  for  income  tax es  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings. PMI  recognizes  income  tax es  associated  with  G lobal  Intangible  Low-Tax ed  Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\n\n## Leases\n\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange  for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the  lease  term. Lease ex pense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item. At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases. The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be ex ercised. Certain of PMI's leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage. These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs. PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Marketing costs\n\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, instore display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives. Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are ex pensed as incurred. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods. PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer's receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI's right to payment for those products and the customer's ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI's performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\n\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer. PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract. The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  PMI is a principal for majority of its arrangements and recognizes revenue at the transaction price, with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories  evolve. For arrangements where PMI acts as an agent, the net commission earned is recognized as revenue. PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reported noncurrent liabilities of $416 million related to retirement and other post-employment benefits, reflecting long-term obligations tied to employee benefits. Coca-Cola disclosed noncurrent liabilities of $37,353 million, indicating a significantly larger long-term debt burden or other long-term obligations. Target, while not disclosing a specific dollar amount for noncurrent liabilities, highlighted that it retains substantial risk for general liability and workers' compensation claims, which are recorded at net present value. These differences suggest that Coca-Cola has the highest level of long-term financial obligations, potentially tied to debt or other liabilities, while Colgate-Palmolive's exposure is more focused on retiree benefits, and Target faces contingent liabilities that are not fully quantified in its financial statements.",

We estimate our ultimate cost based on analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. Note 20 provides the noncurrent balance of these liabilities. (a)\n\n## 15. Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Contingencies\n\nWe are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. When a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and, if material, disclose the estimated range of loss. We do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range. If we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. We do not believe that any of these identified claims or litigation will be material to our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.\n\n## Commitments\n\nPurchase obligations, which include all legally binding contracts such as merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketingrelated  contracts,  software  acquisition/license  commitments,  firm  minimum  commitments  for  inventory  purchases,  and  service contracts,  were  $944  million  and  $785  million  as  of  January  29,  2022,  and  January  30,  2021,  respectively.  These  purchase obligations are primarily due within three years and recorded as liabilities when goods are received or services are rendered. Real estate  obligations,  which  include  legally  binding  minimum  lease  payments  for  leases  signed  but  not  yet  commenced,  and commitments  for  the  purchase,  construction,  or  remodeling  of  real  estate  and  facilities,  were  $2.5  billion  and  $2.1  billion  as  of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. Over half of these real estate obligations are due within one year, a portion of which are recorded as liabilities.\n\nWe  issue  inventory  purchase  orders  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  which  represent  authorizations  to  purchase  that  are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

We also have faced and continue to face challenges to our ability to repatriate cash from Russia and identify banking partners to support our Russian operations and we may face challenges to our ability to protect our assets in Russia. We also continue to monitor the impact of sanctions, export controls and import restrictions imposed generally and in response to the war in Ukraine.\n\n## The Conflict in the Middle East\n\nThe conflict in the Middle East has not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Uncertainties and risks remain as to the duration of the conflict and its impact on geopolitical relations and stability in North Africa, the wider Middle East and nearby regions. The conflict has impacted and may continue to impact, among other things, supply chain and logistics, the availability and price of raw and packaging materials and commodities such as oil, consumer sentiment and consumption and category growth rates in the region.\n\nFor more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, refer to Part I, Item 1A 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Business Strategy\n\nTo achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on delivering consistent compounded earnings per share growth through driving organic sales growth, operational efficiencies and leveraging the strength of our balance sheet. We believe increased household penetration and improved brand health are the keys to consistent organic sales growth and aim to achieve these through science-led, core and premium innovation, pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments and expanding in faster-growing channels and markets. We aim to deliver margin expansion and cash flow growth through operating leverage and efficiency. We continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. We also seek to lead in the development of human capital and to maximize the impact of our Sustainability &amp; Social Impact Strategy. We are building and scaling our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, data, analytics and artificial intelligence, enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.\n\nThe investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect ex penses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification.\n\n## Significant Items Impacting Comparability\n\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we reassessed with our legal and tax advisers certain tax deductions taken in prior years by one of our subsidiaries and concluded that it was more likely than not that the deductions would not be sustained by the courts in that jurisdiction. The value of the tax deductions was not material to us in any year in which they were taken. The cumulative effect of the change in tax  position of $148 was reflected as a discrete item in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 income tax  ex pense, partially offset by the reversal of certain prior years' withholding tax  reserves of $22 that were no longer required (hereinafter referred to as the 'foreign tax  matter'). The tax  liability was paid in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. See Note 10, Income Tax es, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we recorded a charge of $267 as a result of a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the 'Second Circuit') affirming a grant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs in a",

Alternative product businesses (including heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and nicotine pouches) would be transferred to an RBH affiliate or otherwise maintained separately from RBH's combustible business. The Proposed Plan also contains a number of operating covenants that would govern RBH's business going forward until the settlement amount has been paid.\n\nOn  January  15,  2025,  RBH's  court-appointed  monitor  filed  a  motion  seeking  an  order  by  the  CCAA  court  approving  and  sanctioning  the  Proposed  Plan  and authorizing and directing the monitor, among others, to take all steps and actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Proposed Plan ('Sanction Motion' and the requested order, the 'Proposed Sanction Order'). On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to the Sanction Motion ('RBH Objection'). The RBH Objection argues that the Proposed Plan cannot be approved because it fails to resolve the Allocation Issue. The RBH Objection also states that, without an appropriate, fair and reasonable resolution of the Allocation Issue, RBH cannot presently consent to implementation of the Proposed Plan. To address the Allocation Issue, the RBH Objection seeks to amend the Proposed Sanction Order to include provisions (the 'Proposed Allocation Provisions') requiring that ITL and JTIM make payments to RBH from their retained working capital and net income after taxes over a period of years. ITL, JTIM, and certain claimant groups have opposed the Proposed Allocation Provisions set forth in the RBH Objection.\n\nA judicial hearing to consider approval of the Proposed Plan, including the Sanction Motion, the RBH Objection and the Proposed Allocation Provisions, was held from January 29 through January 31, 2025. Further hearing dates may be scheduled. A decision from the CCAA court on whether and what form to sanction the Proposed Plan is expected in the first quarter. If ultimately approved by the CCAA court and, among other things, not subject to appeal, implementation of the Proposed Plan is expected in 2025.\n\nFor additional information concerning the fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH and the impairment charge recorded in the Company's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other .\n\nStayed Litigation - Canada\n\nSmoking and Health Litigation - Canada\n\nIn  the  first  class  action  pending  in  Canada, Conseil  Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois  Sur  Le  Tabac  Et  La  Sant\u00e9 and  Jean-Yves  Blais v.  Imperial  Tobacco  Canada  Ltd., Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada ,  filed  in  November  1998,  RBH  and  other  Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants (the \" Blais Class Action\"). The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who suffers allegedly from certain smoking-related diseases.  The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015. The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members'  compensatory  damages  totaled  approximately  CAD 15.5  billion  (approximately  $10.6  billion),  including  pre-judgment  interest.  The  trial  court  awarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating 20% to our subsidiary (approximately CAD 3.1 billion (approximately $2.1 billion) including pre-judgment interest). In addition, the trial court awarded CAD 90,000 (approximately $62,000) in punitive damages, allocating CAD 30,000 (approximately $21,000) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at 99,957 members. RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish security totaling CAD 226 million (approximately $155 million) to cover both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases, which RBH has paid in installments through  March  2017. The  Court  of Appeal  ordered  Imperial  Tobacco  Canada  Ltd.  to  furnish  security  totaling  CAD 758  million  (approx imately  $520  million)  in installments through June 2017. JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish security in accordance with plaintiffs' motion. The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court's judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn March 1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court's findings of liability and the compensatory and punitive damages award while reducing the total amount of compensatory damages to approximately CAD 13.5 billion (approximately $9.3 billion), including interest due to the trial court's error in the calculation of interest. The compensatory damages award is on a joint and several basis with an allocation of 20% to RBH (approximately CAD 2.7 billion (approximately $1.9 billion), including pre-judgment interest). The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court's findings that defendants violated the Civil Code of Quebec, the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, and the Quebec Consumer Protection Act by failing to warn adequately of the dangers of smoking and by conspiring  to  prevent  consumers  from  learning  of  the  dangers  of  smoking.  The  Court  of Appeal  further  held  that  the  plaintiffs  either  need  not  prove,  or  had adequately  proven,  that  these  faults  were  a  cause  of  the  class  members'  injuries. In  accordance  with  the  judgment,  defendants  were  required  to  deposit  their respective portions of the damages awarded in both the L\u00e9tourneau case described below and the Blais case, approximately CAD 1.1 billion (approximately $754 million),  into  trust  accounts  within 60  days. RBH's share of the deposit was approximately CAD 257 million (approximately $194  million). PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $194 million in its consolidated results, representing $142 million net of tax , as tobacco litigation-related",

      "answer": "In 2023, KO experienced higher commodity costs that partially offset favorable pricing initiatives across several regions, including Latin America, North America, Asia Pacific, and Bottling Investments. MDLZ disclosed that commodity cost increases were a key challenge, influenced by macroeconomic inflation, supply chain disruptions, and currency fluctuations, and they employed hedging and pricing strategies to mitigate these pressures. PG, in contrast, reported lower commodity costs as a contributing factor to improved gross margins, alongside productivity savings and pricing actions. These differences highlight varying regional and sector-specific exposures to commodity markets and distinct strategic approaches to managing input cost volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Commodity Costs: KO reported that higher commodity costs were a consistent headwind across multiple regions (Latin America, North America, Asia Pacific, and Bottling Investments), reducing operating income growth despite favorable pricing initiatives.",
        "Hop 2: MDLZ \u2192 Commodity Costs: MDLZ explicitly disclosed that commodity cost increases were a major challenge, driven by global inflation, supply chain issues, and currency fluctuations. They used hedging and pricing to manage the impact but noted that full protection was not always possible.",
        "Hop 3: PG \u2192 Commodity Costs: PG reported a decrease in commodity costs, which contributed to a 230 basis-point improvement in gross margin, alongside productivity savings and pricing, indicating a more favorable input cost environment for their operations."

PepsiCo (PEP) notes that increased input costs and geopolitical instability may force pricing decisions that reduce volume, revenue, and margins. Philip Morris (PM) emphasizes that regulatory pressures, such as tax increases and plain packaging laws, are expected to continue reducing cigarette sales volume globally. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are sensitive to external pressures affecting volume, MO focuses on internal valuation assumptions, PEP on cost and geopolitical volatility, and PM on regulatory erosion of consumer demand.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reported $713 million in Other Current Assets in 2024, a decrease from $793 million in 2023, suggesting a reduction in non-core liquid resources. Costco maintained a relatively stable level with $1,734 million in Other Current Assets in 2024, compared to $1,709 million the prior year, indicating consistent management of short-term flexible assets. Altria, however, showed a significant decline from $117 million in 2023 to just $36 million in 2024, pointing to a possible reallocation or write-down of short-term assets. These differences suggest varying approaches to liquidity management, with COST maintaining flexibility, CL moderately reducing it, and MO significantly curtailing its Other Current Assets.",

      "question": "How do PepsiCo (PEP), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Philip Morris International (PM) each account for goodwill and other intangible assets, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to asset impairment and valuation methodologies?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo (PEP) identifies goodwill and other intangible assets as one of its critical accounting policies, indicating that these assets are subject to significant management judgment and are sensitive to macroeconomic uncertainties such as geopolitical conflicts and inflation. Procter & Gamble (PG) provides a detailed explanation of its impairment testing procedures, noting that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. PG also discusses how indefinite-lived assets may be reclassified to determinable lives based on changes in operating conditions. Philip Morris International (PM) discloses that segment-level goodwill and other intangible assets are reported net and referenced in Note 5, indicating a structured approach to asset valuation and impairment tracking. When combined, these perspectives show that while all three companies treat goodwill and intangible assets with high scrutiny, they differ in the specificity of their impairment triggers and the level of detail provided on valuation adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PEP \u2192 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: PEP identifies goodwill and other intangible assets as a critical accounting policy, subject to subjective judgment and macroeconomic uncertainty, though it does not provide specific valuation or impairment testing details.",
        "Hop 2: PG \u2192 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: PG details its impairment testing process, distinguishing between indefinite-lived and determinable-lived intangible assets, and explains how changes in operating conditions may affect asset classification and valuation.",
        "Hop 3: PM \u2192 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: PM reports goodwill and intangible assets net by segment and refers to Note 5 for details, indicating a structured but less transparent approach to impairment and valuation adjustments compared to PG."

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), PepsiCo (PEP), and Walmart (WMT) each approach participant contributions in their retirement and postretirement benefit plans, and what does this reveal about their respective employee benefit strategies?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) reports participant contributions of $5 million in 2023 for both pension and other postretirement plans, indicating a minimal but consistent employee contribution. PepsiCo (PEP) shows participant contributions of $2 million in 2023 for its international pension plans, while no contributions are reported for U.S. pension or retiree medical plans, suggesting a more employer-funded structure for U.S. employees. Walmart (WMT) emphasizes a 401(k) plan with a strong employer match of 100% up to 6% of annual eligible earnings after one year of employment, with participants able to contribute up to 50% of pre-tax earnings. This reveals that WMT places more emphasis on defined contribution plans with generous employer matching, while KO and PEP rely on more traditional pension structures with limited participant input, especially in the U.S. context.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) highlights that temporary differences between financial and tax accounting result in the current tax provision being higher or lower than the total income tax provision. Costco (COST) reports a total provision for income taxes of $2,195 million in 2023, with federal, state, and foreign components of $1,089 million, $384 million, and $722 million respectively, showing a growing federal and foreign current tax burden. Walmart (WMT) reports a significantly higher total tax provision of $5,724 million in 2023, with a current tax provision of $5,294 million and a deferred tax expense of $430 million, driven by U.S. federal and international tax components. These differences suggest that while COST maintains a relatively balanced tax exposure across jurisdictions, WMT faces a much larger overall tax burden, particularly from current U.S. federal taxes, and CL emphasizes the impact of accounting differences on its tax provision.",

      "answer": "PG discusses pension costs as part of its broader exposure to input cost fluctuations, indicating that rising pension and healthcare expenses could pressure margins. PM provides detailed quantitative data, showing a $294 million impact from pension net losses and a total pension-related movement of $1,154 million during the year. TGT reports a reduction in pension-related accumulated other comprehensive loss from $735 million to $583 million, signaling a partial reversal of prior pension liabilities. These differences suggest that PM has the most direct and substantial ongoing pension exposure, TGT has seen some relief, and PG treats pension risk as part of a broader cost management challenge.",

Inflation pressures could also result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results  depend,  in  part,  on  our  continued  ability  to  manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and  sourcing  decisions,  while  maintaining  and  improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations  could  adversely  impact  our  results  of  operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how  well  we  can  compete  with  our  local  and  global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all  of  our  categories,  we  compete  against  a  wide  variety  of global  and  local  competitors.  As  a  result,  we  experience ongoing  competitive  pressures  in  the  environments  in  which we  operate,  which  may  result  in  challenges  in  maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be  able  to  successfully  respond  to  competitive  factors  and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives,  product  delivery  windows  and  trade  terms.  In addition,  evolving  sales  channels  and  business  models  may affect  customer  and  consumer  preferences  as  well  as  market dynamics,  which,  for  example,  may  be  seen  in  the  growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry  into  certain  categories  and  growth  in  hard  discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing  sales  channels  and  business  models,  particularly  ecommerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe  sell  most  of  our  products  via  retail  customers,  which include  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty  beauty  stores  (including  airport  duty-free  stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores  and professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot  reach  agreement  with  a  key  customer  on  trade  terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if  a  key  customer  were  to  significantly  reduce  the  inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased  offerings  of  other  branded  manufacturers,  private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons,  significantly  tighten  product  delivery  windows  or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If  the  reputation  of  the  Company  or  one  or  more  of  our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation  of  our  brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and  our  financial  success  directly  depends  on  the  success  of our  brands.  The  success  of  our  brands  can  suffer  if  our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also  be negatively  impacted  if  the  Company  or  one  of  our  brands suffers  substantial  harm  to  its  reputation  due  to  a  significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions  of  certain  ingredients,  negative  perceptions  of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleumbased materials), lack of recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns about actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices, privacy lapses or data breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.  Additionally,  negative  or  inaccurate  postings  or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage  the reputation of our brands or the Company.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  real  or perceived  issues,  including  concerns  about  safety,  quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the  Company  or  our products  could  be  negatively  impacted,  and  our  results  of operations  or  cash  flows  could  suffer.  Our  Company  also devotes  time  and  resources  to  citizenship  efforts  that  are consistent  with  our  corporate  values  and  are  designed  to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation,  including  programs  driving  ethics  and  corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental  sustainability.  While  the  Company  has  many programs and initiatives  to  further  these  goals,  our  ability  to achieve  these  goals  is  impacted  in  part  by  the  actions  and efforts of third parties including local and other governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers. If these programs  are  not  executed  as  planned  or  suffer  negative publicity,  the  Company's  reputation  and  results  of  operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nDue to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract  manufacturers,  distributors,  contractors,  commercial banks,  joint  venture  partners  and  external  business  partners, for  certain  functions.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash  flows  could  be  adversely  impacted.  Further,  failure  of these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the",

      "question": "How do COST, MDLZ, and PEP each reflect the financial and strategic significance of their Europe segments, and what does this reveal about their regional priorities and challenges in 2023?",
      "answer": "COST highlights that its Europe segment faces risks from political and economic instability, regulatory constraints, and currency fluctuations, which could negatively affect its international operations and expansion plans. MDLZ explicitly includes Europe as one of its four key operating segments, indicating its strategic importance in managing regional business and pursuing growth opportunities. PEP reported an $862 million impairment of intangible assets in its Europe segment, tied to the SodaStream brand and goodwill, signaling financial challenges and potential strategic reevaluation in that region. Together, these perspectives show that while Europe remains a strategically important market for all three companies, it also presents distinct financial and operational risks that vary in nature and impact.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reported a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by 50 basis points in Asia Pacific, driven by reduced advertising investment. Costco noted that rising commodity prices and inflationary pressures negatively impacted its SG&A expenses, affecting its cost structure and operational efficiency. Coca-Cola experienced an $1,092 million (8%) increase in SG&A expenses, primarily due to higher advertising and marketing costs, despite reductions from refranchising bottling operations. Together, these trends illustrate contrasting strategies: Colgate focused on cost containment, Costco faced external cost pressures, and Coca-Cola invested more in marketing and brand development.",

See 'Other Consolidated Results' for further inform ation.\n\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further inform ation.\n\n## Pension and Retiree Medical Plans\n\nOur pension plans cover certain em ployees in the United States and certain international em ployees. Benefits are determ ined based on either years of service or a com bination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for m edical and life insurance benefits (retiree m edical) if they m eet age and service requirem ents. Generally , our share of retiree m edical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the rem ainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree m edical benefits.\n\nSee 'Items Affecting Comparability' and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statem ents for inform ation about changes and settlem ents within our pension plans.\n\n## Our Assumptions\n\nThe determination of pension and retiree m edical expenses and obligations requires the use of assum ptions to estim ate the am ount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree m edical expense am ounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by em ployees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of tim e (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated fi n an ci al  statem en ts, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.\n\nSignificant assum ptions used to m easure our annual pension and retiree m edical expenses include:\n\n- certain em ployee-related dem ographic factors, such as turnover, retirem ent age and m ortality;\n- the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans; and\n- the spot rates along the yield curve used to determ ine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities.\n\nCertain assumptions reflect our historical experience and m anagem ent's best judgm ent regarding future expectations. All actuarial assum ptions are reviewed annually ,  except  in  the  case  of  an  interim   rem easurem ent  due  to  a  significant  event  such  as  a  curtailm ent  or  settl em ent.  Due  to  the signifi cant m anagem ent judgm ent involved, these assum ptions could have a m aterial im pact on the m easurem ent of our pension and retiree m edical expenses and obligations.\n\nAt each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality , long-term  corporate debt securities with m aturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree m edical expense is based on the discount rates determ ined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely m atch the tim ing and am ount of our expected benefit paym ents and reflects the portfolio of investm ents we would consider to settle our liabilities.\n\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statem ents for inform ation about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans' investm ent strategy . Although we review our expected long-term  rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly i n f l u en ce ou r ev al u ati on  of  l on g -term  rates of  retu rn .",

Procter & Gamble (PG) shows a noncurrent liabilities balance of $2,884 million related to pension benefits as of June 30, 2024, with a net actuarial loss of $1,258 million.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) uses TSR as a historical performance metric to illustrate the value of reinvested dividends over time, with a base investment of $100 on December 31, 2018. Philip Morris (PM) integrates TSR as a weighted performance metric (40%) in its Performance Share Unit (PSU) awards, measuring it both absolutely and relative to a peer group over a 3-year cycle, with payout potential ranging from 0% to 200% of target. Target (TGT) also uses TSR as a relative performance measure against a retail peer group to determine the final number of shares issued under performance-based restricted stock units over a 3-year period. This shows that while all three companies use TSR in incentive structures, KO focuses on historical reinvestment returns, PM combines TSR with earnings and sustainability goals, and TGT emphasizes relative TSR performance within the retail sector to align executive outcomes with shareholder value creation.",

In contrast, PG benefited from lower commodity costs, which, alongside productivity savings and pricing, contributed to a 230 basis-point improvement in gross margin.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) reported a net deferred tax asset related to benefit plans of $554 million in 2023, up from $522 million in 2022, indicating a growing tax asset tied to these obligations. Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ) recorded a pension and benefit plan-related comprehensive loss of $218 million in 2023, contrasting with a gain of $274 million in 2022, highlighting volatility in the valuation of these liabilities. Altria (MO) showed a balance of $1,493 million in accumulated losses related to benefit plans by the end of 2023, up from $1,436 million in 2022, reflecting a continued negative impact on its comprehensive earnings. Collectively, these figures reveal that while all three companies face significant exposure to benefit plans, the direction and magnitude of these impacts vary, with KO showing growth in asset value, MDLZ experiencing a reversal in performance, and MO facing increasing losses.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Colgate-Palmolive reported a slight increase in total current assets from $5,113 million to $5,279 million, driven by growth in cash and receivables despite a decline in inventories. Mondel\u0113z International saw a more significant increase from $10,091 million to $11,703 million, largely due to a rise in trade receivables and a notable increase in other current assets. Philip Morris experienced a marginal increase from $19,619 million to $19,755 million, with growth in inventories and cash, despite a drop in trade receivables. These changes reflect differing liquidity strategies: CL maintained conservative growth, MDLZ expanded its receivables and other current assets, and PM focused on inventory buildup.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reported an increase in Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC) from $3,546 million to $3,808 million, indicating a net increase of $262 million. Mondel\u0113z International (MDLZ) showed a modest increase in APIC from $32,143 million to $32,216 million, reflecting a small net change of $73 million. Philip Morris International (PM) also experienced growth in APIC, rising from $2,230 million to $2,285 million, an increase of $55 million. These increases suggest that all three companies may have issued new equity or experienced positive capital adjustments during the year, though the magnitude of these changes varies significantly across firms. CL and PM, with relatively smaller APIC bases, experienced proportionally larger changes compared to MDLZ, which has a much larger capital base and saw a smaller relative shift.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) includes royalty rates as a key component in the impairment testing of equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets, estimating them alongside other factors like sales volume, pricing, and discount rates. Mondelez (MDLZ) relies on royalty rates as part of its valuation methodologies (e.g., relief from royalty) when assessing the fair value of brand names during annual impairment tests, requiring significant judgment in forecasting future sales and growth. Procter & Gamble (PG) uses royalty rates in its income method-based fair value estimation for indefinite-lived intangible assets, particularly the Gillette brand, where a 50 basis-point decrease in the royalty rate could significantly impact the asset\u2019s fair value and potentially trigger further impairment. Together, these approaches highlight the critical role of royalty rate assumptions in valuing and monitoring brand strength across the consumer staples sector.",

        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Royalty Rates: KO discloses that royalty rates are among the critical estimates used in impairment testing of equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets, alongside factors like sales volume, pricing, and cost assumptions.",

      "answer": "In 2024, MDLZ reports $47 million in finance lease obligations, TGT reports $176 million, and WMT reports $675 million. These figures indicate that WMT has a significantly larger reliance on finance leases compared to TGT and MDLZ, suggesting a more asset-intensive strategy. MDLZ's lower finance lease obligation reflects a more conservative capital structure, while TGT's position suggests moderate use of finance leases relative to its overall leasing activity.",
