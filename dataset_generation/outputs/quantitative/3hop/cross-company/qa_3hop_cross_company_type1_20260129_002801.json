      "answer": "CMCSA experienced a 1.5% increase in costs and expenses in 2023, while META's Apps Segment saw a 2% decrease in the same period. This divergence suggests that CMCSA faced rising operational pressures, whereas META successfully reduced its costs in the Apps Segment, potentially improving profitability in that division.",

      "answer": "Disney's Direct-to-Consumer business includes distribution costs as part of its operating expenses, which encompass technology support, operating labor, and fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air linear network feeds. These costs are integral to the segment's operations and are influenced by the company's flexible distribution strategy, which may shift cost allocations and revenue timing across platforms. Meanwhile, Comcast explicitly excludes distribution costs (such as marketing and distribution expenses for theatrical releases or licensing) from capitalized film and television content costs, treating them as period expenses. This indicates that while both companies recognize distribution costs as a key expense, Disney integrates them into a broader allocation model tied to content distribution platforms, whereas Comcast separates them from content amortization and treats them as immediate operating costs.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs  are  based  on  anticipated  release  patterns  and  distribution  strategies,  public  acceptance  and  historical  results  for  similar productions.  Amortization  for  content  predominantly  monetized  with  other  owned  or  licensed  content  is  recorded  based  on estimated  usage.  In  determining  the  method  of  amortization  and  estimated  life  of  an  acquired  film  or  television  library,  we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do  not  capitalize  costs  related  to  the  distribution  of  a  film  in  movie  theaters  or  the  licensing  or  sale  of  a  film  or  television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe may enter  into  cofinancing  arrangements  with  third  parties  to  jointly  finance  or  distribute  certain  of  our  film  productions. Cofinancing  arrangements  can  take  various  forms,  but  in  most  cases  involve  the  grant  of  an  economic  interest  in  a  film  to  an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor's  interest  in  the  profit  or  loss  of  the  film  is  recorded  as  either  a  charge  or  a  benefit,  respectively,  in  programming  and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and  record  an  impairment  charge  to  the  extent  the  unamortized  costs  exceed  the  fair  value.  Owned  content  is  assessed  either individually  or  in  identified  film  groups,  for  content  predominantly  monetized  on  an  individual  basis  or  with  other  content, respectively.  The  substantial  majority  of  our  owned  content  is  evaluated  for  impairment  on  an  individual  title  basis.  Licensed content that  is  not  part  of  a  film  group  is  generally  assessed  in  packages,  channels  or  dayparts. A  daypart  is  an  aggregation  of programs  broadcast  during  a  particular  time  of  day  or  programs  of  a  similar  type.  Licensed  content  is  tested  for  impairment primarily  on  a  channel,  network  or  platform  basis,  with  the  exception  of  our  broadcast  networks  and  owned  local  broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative  value.  Estimated  relative  value  is  generally  based  on  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  nature  of  and  potential  revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment.  When  cash  payments,  including  advanced  payments,  exceed  the  relative  value  of  the  sports  rights  delivered,  we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented with licensed content.\n\n## Note 5: Income Taxes\n\n## Income Before Income Taxes\n\n",

      "answer": "AT&T's Entertainment segment incurred distribution costs as part of its operating expenses in 2023, which included programming and production costs, technology support, and labor. These costs directly affected the segment's profitability and overall performance.

      "answer": "NFLX reduces its content amortization by $899 million in 2024 due to tax incentives earned on qualified production spend, which directly lowers the cost basis of content assets. This reduction in amortization is based on historical and forecasted viewing patterns used in their amortization model. CMCSA also benefits from tax incentives, which are recorded as a reduction of capitalized film and television costs, with a corresponding decrease in amortization. However, CMCSA's amortization methodology relies on the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes costs based on the ratio of associated ultimate revenue, whereas NFLX uses estimated viewing patterns. These differing amortization approaches mean that while both companies benefit from tax incentives, the financial impact is calculated using fundamentally different operational and financial assumptions.",

If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Telev ision Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

The CODM  uses segment operating income to allocate resources (including employees, financial or capital resources) and to assess performance during the monthly and quarterly financial strategic review process. When assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources, the CODM  focuses on evaluating whether revenues generated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate return on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM  using segment operating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network technologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's priorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks, establishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions, branding matters and people management.\n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:",

      "answer": "CMCSA's Entertainment segment reports amortization of capitalized production costs as a key component of its programming and production costs, which are allocated across its businesses based on the estimated relative value of distribution windows. Meanwhile, DIS also lists amortization of capitalized production costs as a major expense within its Entertainment segment, directly affecting segment operating income. Both companies disclose this expense in their respective 10-K filings, with DIS specifically noting its inclusion in the broader category of programming and production costs. The detailed breakdown of how each company accounts for and allocates these costs suggests varying impacts on operating margins, depending on the scale and distribution of content monetization.",

      "answer": "GOOGL's advertising revenue represented over 75% of its total revenues in 2024, highlighting its heavy reliance on this income stream. CMCSA, on the other hand, includes advertising revenue as one of the components influencing its average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Therefore, if GOOGL experiences volatility or a decline in advertising revenue due to regulatory, competitive, or market factors, it could indirectly affect the broader advertising ecosystem, including CMCSA's advertising revenue. This, in turn, could impact CMCSA's average monthly total revenue per customer relationship, especially since CMCSA notes that changes in advertising revenue influence this metric. Thus, a downturn in GOOGL's core revenue source could ripple through to CMCSA's customer revenue trends.",

This aligns with the methodology described in NFLX's 10-K, where tax incentives are recognized as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets, resulting in lower amortization over the life of the title. Meanwhile, DIS disclosed that its acquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years, with impairment testing conducted either at the individual title level or as a group, depending on monetization strategy. The $899 million reduction for NFLX reflects a similar mechanism where incentives lower the initial cost basis, which in turn reduces the annual amortization expense, consistent with the 20-year amortization framework DIS applies to its own acquired content.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, ex cept it ex cludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title's unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the ex tent the title's unamortized costs ex ceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\n\n## Content Production Incentives\n\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as 'Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset's amortization period.\n\n## Internal-Use Software Costs\n\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.\n\n## Parks, Resorts and Other Property\n\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n",

In contrast, CMCSA experienced a more modest 1.5% increase in costs and expenses from 2022 to 2023, suggesting a more stable or slower-growing investment approach in its content delivery infrastructure. This divergence highlights META's aggressive push into VR development compared to CMCSA's relatively restrained cost growth.",

In contrast, AT&T\u2019s Latin America - Mexico segment reported an Operating Loss of $326 million during the same period.

      "answer": "Disney reported a 7% year-over-year increase in Total Hulu subscribers, reaching 52.0 million as of September 28, 2024, up from 48.5 million in the prior year. Meanwhile, AT&T disclosed that it provides wireless services to approximately 22 million subscribers in Mexico. The significant subscriber growth at Hulu suggests strong demand for streaming services, while AT&T's substantial wireless subscriber base in Mexico highlights its entrenched position in the telecommunications market. This contrast may reflect differing growth trajectories between streaming platforms and traditional telecom providers in key markets.",

In contrast, GOOGL's unallocated AI R&D activities, including general AI model development, are significant enough to be explicitly called out as not allocated to any segment and are central to corporate-level planning. This suggests T focuses relatively modestly on Latin America as an emerging market, while GOOGL is heavily investing in foundational AI research at the corporate level, indicating divergent strategic priorities between the two companies.",

As further announced, in October 2024, the Gemini app team that is dev eloping the direct consumer interface to our Gemini models joined Google DeepMind. The costs associated with the Gemini app team continue to be reported within our Google Serv ices segment.\n\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-lev el activ ities. T hese costs primarily include certain AI-focused shared R&amp;D activities, including dev elopment costs of our general AI models; corporate initiativ es such as our philanthropic activ ities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee sev erance and office space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to rev enue are not allocated to our segments.\n\nOur Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executiv e Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses segment operating income (loss) to allocate  resources  to  our  segments  in  our  annual  planning  process  and  to  assess  the  performance  of  our  segments,  primarily  by  monitoring  actual results v ersus the annual plan.

      "answer": "CMCSA's 2023 filing shows that advertising revenue is a key factor in maintaining average monthly total revenue per customer relationship, even as customers change service bundles. This indicates CMCSA has a mature advertising infrastructure that helps stabilize revenue. In contrast, NFLX's 2023 filing highlights significant risks in its ability to grow advertising revenue, including challenges in attracting advertisers and retaining members under an ad-supported model. CMCSA's demonstrated success in monetizing advertising therefore creates direct competitive pressure on NFLX, which is still building its advertising capabilities and faces uncertainty in advertiser demand and member satisfaction.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization\n\nA significant  portion  of  our  intangible  assets  are  wireless  licenses  that  prov ide  our  wireless  operations  with  the  ex clusiv e  right  to  utiliz e  designated  radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten to fifteen years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. M oreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. A s a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network.\n\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitativ e  assessment  to  determine  whether  it  is  necessary  to  perform  a  quantitative  impairment  test.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.\n\nAs part of our qualitative assessment we consider several factors including the enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA  margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitativ e assessment. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests.\n\nOur quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A  discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized.\n\nInterest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.\n\nWireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets\n\nOur intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful liv es. A ll of our intangible assets subject to amortiz ation and other long-liv ed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment, if any . We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.\n\nSee Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately , we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use.\n\nFor both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability , which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company",

      "answer": "Disney's DTC subscription fees faced downward pressure due to intense competition from other streaming services and alternative forms of entertainment, which limited its ability to grow pricing and subscriber levels. Meanwhile, Google Cloud reported $43,229 million in revenue for 2024, up from $33,088 million in 2023, driven by enterprise demand for cloud infrastructure and subscription-based services like Google Workspace. While Disney's consumer-facing subscription model is constrained by market saturation and pricing sensitivity, Google Cloud's B2B-focused offerings appear to be capitalizing on digital transformation trends, suggesting divergent competitive dynamics between consumer and enterprise subscription markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Increased competitive pressures impact our revenues, increase our costs and impact the profitability of our businesses.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\n\n## We face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical ex perience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical ex perience. For ex ample, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor's subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining  our  2016  through  2021  tax  returns.  We  hav e  also  receiv ed  tax  assessments  in  multiple  foreign  jurisdictions  asserting  transfer  pricing adjustments or permanent establishment.

There are other ongoing audits in v arious other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\n\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adv erse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our prov ision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in v arious taxing jurisdictions.\n\nWe believe that an adequate prov ision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. Howev er, the outcome of tax audits  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are  resolv ed  in  a  manner  not  consistent  with  management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our prov ision for  income taxes in the period such resolutions occur.

Google Services generates rev enues primarily from adv ertising; fees receiv ed for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and dev ices.\n- Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform serv ices, applications, and other serv ices for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates rev enues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  receiv ed  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  serv ices,  Google  Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise serv ices.\n- Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not indiv idually material.

In contrast, CMCSA used internally forecasted revenue growth rates as part of its discounted cash flow model to assess the goodwill impairment for the Media reporting unit. Although CMCSA did not explicitly state the exact growth rate used, the company's auditors evaluated the reasonableness of these forecasts, suggesting that the assumed growth rate played a critical role in concluding that no impairment was necessary for the $20 billion Media reporting unit. This comparison highlights how different revenue growth expectations may inform distinct financial strategies and asset valuations between the two companies.",

We also developed an expectation of aggregate domestic residential revenue from subscribers based on cash received during the year.  We compared those estimates to revenue recognized by the Company.\n\n## Goodwill - Refer to Note 9 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe  Company's  evaluation  of  goodwill  for  impairment  is  performed  at  the  reporting  unit  level.  To  determine  its  reporting  units,  the  Company  evaluates  the components one level below the segment level and aggregates the components if they have similar economic characteristics. The Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Media reporting unit, which involved a comparison of the fair value of the Media reporting unit to its carrying value.\n\nThe Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant judgments related to discount rates and forecasts of expected cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $58 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $20 billion was allocated to the Media reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of the Media reporting unit ex ceeded its carrying value and no impairment was recognized.\n\nWe identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the Media reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate  the  fair  value  of  the  Media  reporting  unit.  This  required  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  and  an  increased  ex tent  of  effort,  when  performing  audit procedures to evaluate management's conclusion related to the aggregation of components into a single reporting unit and the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate, revenue growth rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin included in future expected cash flows for the Media reporting unit.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures to evaluate the determination of the reporting unit as well as the discount rate, revenue growth rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin included in future expected cash flows used by management to estimate the fair value of the Media reporting unit included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over (a) the accounting policies regarding identification of the unit of account for goodwill and (b) the determination of the fair value of Media, such as controls related to management's selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows.\n- With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n- We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results in the respective years.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, ex cept it ex cludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title's unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the ex tent the title's unamortized costs ex ceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\n\n## Content Production Incentives\n\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as 'Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset's amortization period.\n\n## Internal-Use Software Costs\n\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.\n\n## Parks, Resorts and Other Property\n\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n",

      "question": "How might CMCSA's direct investment in theme parks influence their ability to capitalize on the growing popularity of international theme park destinations, given Disney's royalty-based revenue model at Tokyo Disney Resort and OLC's operational control of the park?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's direct investment in theme parks allows them to maintain full operational control and capture 100% of the revenues generated, which could be advantageous in high-growth international markets. In contrast, Disney earns royalties on revenues from Tokyo Disney Resort, which is owned and operated by Oriental Land Co. (OLC), limiting Disney's direct financial upside despite the resort's expansion, including the June 2024 opening of Fantasy Springs Hotel. While Disney's licensing model reduces capital exposure, CMCSA's strategy may offer greater flexibility to scale and adapt to international demand for immersive entertainment experiences.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe number of entertainment choices available to consumers, including DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, social networking and user-generated content platforms,  and  gaming  and  virtual  reality  products  and  services,  continue  to  increase,  intensify  audience  fragmentation  and  disaggregate  how  content traditionally has been distributed to and viewed by consumers. The continuing trend of content owners, including us with Peacock, delivering their content directly to  consumers,  rather  than  through,  or  in  addition  to,  traditional  video  distribution  channels  also  disrupts  traditional  media  distribution  business  models.  As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming services in lieu of linear video services, which continue to experience accelerated net customer losses, our video customers and video revenues, and linear television network subscriber fees received from video service providers, each decrease. In addition to reducing traditional television viewership, these trends when coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our television networks. Shifting content consumption patterns also may result in lower demand for home entertainment products or theatrical attendance. While we have adapted some of our video and content offerings to compete in the evolving media distribution landscape, such as by offering Peacock and NOW, there also can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete or that Peacock will grow or sustain its revenue or user base, successfully compete as a stand-alone DTC streaming service or fully offset decreases to our linear television networks' results of operations.\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nWe compete for the sale of advertising time with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers as advertisers have shifted, and may continue to shift, a larger portion of their total expenditures to digital media. We also compete with other online content providers, such as social  networking  platforms  and  user-generated  content  providers,  television  networks  and  stations,  and  all  other  advertising  platforms.  Because  we  derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models or on Peacock, could negatively impact our results of operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, declines caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries and economic conditions generally; increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, audience fragmentation and viewing content on DTC streaming services; use of time-shifting or advertising-blocking technologies; and regulatory intervention on advertising placement. Lower audience ratings  and  reduced  viewership,  which  many  of  our  linear  television  networks  have  ex perienced,  and  likely  will  continue  to  ex perience,  as  well  as  the  level  of popularity of Peacock, affect advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us and the rates paid. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\n\nWe create and acquire media, sports and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. To meet the changing preferences of our consumer markets, we must consistently create, acquire, market and distribute a broad array of content and theme park attractions. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in content, such as the production of films and original content for television networks and streaming services, and in the creation of new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance.\n\nWe obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense. Entering into or renewing contracts for such content rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in significantly increased costs, potentially over an extended contractual term. Particularly with respect to contracts for sports rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own DTC services. There can be no assurance that revenue generated from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights and of producing and distributing the programming. In addition, media companies may determine not to license popular content to us, and as more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these contracts on acceptable terms could reduce the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our results of operations and businesses.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\n## Seasonality and other\n\nOur  advertising  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and underlying  business  trends,  such  as  traditional  retail  seasonality.  Additionally,  our  non-advertising  revenues,  including those  generated  from  Google  Cloud,  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube,  may  be  affected  by  fluctuations  driven  by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\n\n## Revenues and Monetization Metrics\n\n## Google Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising ('Google advertising') as well as revenues from other sources ('Google other revenues').\n\n## Google Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to  provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period.\n\nA summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "An analyst would evaluate Disney's royalty-based model for Tokyo Disney Resort by noting that Disney earns royalties on revenues generated by the resort, which includes two theme parks (Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea) and six Disney-branded hotels, including the newly opened Tokyo DisneySea Fantasy Springs Hotel (June 2024). This royalty structure provides revenue visibility tied directly to top-line performance without bearing operating expenses. In contrast, Comcast's Theme Parks segment includes full P&L responsibility, with expenses covering theme park operations, repairs and maintenance, food, beverage, merchandise, labor, and marketing costs. This direct ownership model exposes Comcast to both revenue and cost volatility, but also allows for full capture of operating margins. While Disney's model offers more predictable revenue with no margin visibility, Comcast's model provides full margin control but with less revenue predictability, making cross-company margin comparisons complex without normalized operating metrics.",

      "answer": "VZ evaluates its wireless licenses for impairment by considering industry EBITDA margins as part of the qualitative assessment. T's Latin America segment, which contributes $3,144 million in total revenue and has shown weak EBITDA margin growth (from 14.8% in 2023 to 16.5% in 2024), could signal lower regional profitability and growth potential. Since VZ's impairment testing methodology includes assessing industry and market conditions\u2014such as EBITDA margins\u2014this underperformance may negatively influence the fair value of wireless licenses in that region, especially if T's stake reflects broader market trends that VZ must factor into its Greenfield-based valuation model.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization\n\nA significant  portion  of  our  intangible  assets  are  wireless  licenses  that  prov ide  our  wireless  operations  with  the  ex clusiv e  right  to  utiliz e  designated  radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten to fifteen years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. M oreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. A s a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network.\n\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitativ e  assessment  to  determine  whether  it  is  necessary  to  perform  a  quantitative  impairment  test.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.\n\nAs part of our qualitative assessment we consider several factors including the enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA  margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitativ e assessment. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests.\n\nOur quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A  discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized.\n\nInterest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.\n\nWireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets\n\nOur intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful liv es. A ll of our intangible assets subject to amortiz ation and other long-liv ed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment, if any . We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.\n\nSee Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately , we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use.\n\nFor both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability , which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Theme Parks segment reported $2,498 million in Adjusted EBITDA, which represented approximately 28.7% of NBCUniversal's total Adjusted EBITDA of $8,711 million. However, pandemic-related capacity restrictions and temporary closures significantly impacted this segment, with uncertainty remaining about future attendance levels and operations. In contrast, DIS's fiscal 2023 content production plans emphasize a diversified output of over 270 original programs across multiple genres and platforms, including both linear networks and DTC services, suggesting a more resilient and scalable content-driven business model compared to the physical venue exposure of CMCSA's Theme Parks.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

      "answer": "CMCSA's 2023 adjusted operating profit excluded the impact of certain events, gains, losses, or other charges to help investors evaluate ongoing operations and make period-over-period comparisons.

In contrast, T reported an operating income of $2,873 million in 2023, showing a decline from $3,175 million in 2022.

      "answer": "Disney allocates distribution costs to its Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer segments, with the latter paying fees to Linear Networks for airing network feeds and other services. In contrast, Comcast explicitly excludes distribution costs\u2014such as marketing and theatrical distribution\u2014from capitalization, treating them as period expenses rather than deferring them. This means Disney may spread distribution costs across platforms based on usage or value, while Comcast recognizes these costs immediately, impacting short-term profitability differently across the two companies' media operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding. (2)\n\nIncludes amortization of intangibles related to TFCF equity investees. (3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs  are  based  on  anticipated  release  patterns  and  distribution  strategies,  public  acceptance  and  historical  results  for  similar productions.  Amortization  for  content  predominantly  monetized  with  other  owned  or  licensed  content  is  recorded  based  on estimated  usage.  In  determining  the  method  of  amortization  and  estimated  life  of  an  acquired  film  or  television  library,  we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do  not  capitalize  costs  related  to  the  distribution  of  a  film  in  movie  theaters  or  the  licensing  or  sale  of  a  film  or  television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe may enter  into  cofinancing  arrangements  with  third  parties  to  jointly  finance  or  distribute  certain  of  our  film  productions. Cofinancing  arrangements  can  take  various  forms,  but  in  most  cases  involve  the  grant  of  an  economic  interest  in  a  film  to  an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor's  interest  in  the  profit  or  loss  of  the  film  is  recorded  as  either  a  charge  or  a  benefit,  respectively,  in  programming  and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and  record  an  impairment  charge  to  the  extent  the  unamortized  costs  exceed  the  fair  value.  Owned  content  is  assessed  either individually  or  in  identified  film  groups,  for  content  predominantly  monetized  on  an  individual  basis  or  with  other  content, respectively.  The  substantial  majority  of  our  owned  content  is  evaluated  for  impairment  on  an  individual  title  basis.  Licensed content that  is  not  part  of  a  film  group  is  generally  assessed  in  packages,  channels  or  dayparts. A  daypart  is  an  aggregation  of programs  broadcast  during  a  particular  time  of  day  or  programs  of  a  similar  type.  Licensed  content  is  tested  for  impairment primarily  on  a  channel,  network  or  platform  basis,  with  the  exception  of  our  broadcast  networks  and  owned  local  broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative  value.  Estimated  relative  value  is  generally  based  on  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  nature  of  and  potential  revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment.  When  cash  payments,  including  advanced  payments,  exceed  the  relative  value  of  the  sports  rights  delivered,  we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented with licensed content.\n\n## Note 5: Income Taxes\n\n## Income Before Income Taxes\n\n",

      "answer": "Google's cost of revenues includes content acquisition costs primarily related to YouTube, where it pays fees to content providers based on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or flat fees, as well as depreciation and employee compensation expenses tied to technical infrastructure. These costs are a key component of Google's broader cost structure, which also includes operating expenses like R&D and sales. In contrast, Netflix's reported cost of revenues for 2024 was $1,629 million, which includes content licensing and production costs, though infrastructure-related depreciation and employee compensation expenses are not explicitly detailed in the provided data. Therefore, while both companies incur significant costs in content delivery, Google's cost of revenues provides more transparency into infrastructure-related expenditures compared to Netflix's more opaque cost structure.",

Certain  of  our  costs  and  expenses,  including  those  associated  with  the  operation  of  our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues primarily includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n- employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content rev iew and customer and product support;\n- inv entory and other costs related to the dev ices we sell; and\n- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\n\nTAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the adv ertiser rev enues from ads serv ed on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses",

      "answer": "Disney reduced its total costs and expenses from $79,906 million in 2023 to $79,447 million in 2024, a decrease of $459 million, as part of its cost management strategy. In contrast, Comcast experienced a slight 0.1% increase in costs and expenses, rising from $2,877 million in 2023 to $2,880 million in 2024. This divergence suggests that while Disney focused on cost containment and operational efficiency, Comcast maintained or slightly expanded its cost base, potentially reflecting different strategic priorities or operational dynamics in managing their entertainment businesses.",

This shows that CMCSA has a more diversified intangible asset base with a mix of finite and indefinite-lived assets.

      "answer": "Disney's Direct-to-Consumer segment generates revenue from both subscription fees and advertising, indicating a dual-revenue model that diversifies its income streams. In contrast, Meta explicitly notes that its strategic shift toward formats like Reels, which monetize at a lower rate than traditional Feed and Stories products, could adversely affect its financial results. This suggests that while Disney is balancing advertising with subscription revenue, Meta is actively navigating reduced monetization in key product areas, making Disney's advertising exposure less central and potentially more stable compared to Meta's more vulnerable advertising-dependent business model.",

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

Similarly, Disney utilizes tax incentives from U.S. and foreign government agencies, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs, thereby lowering programming and production costs over the asset's amortization period.

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, ex cept it ex cludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title's unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the ex tent the title's unamortized costs ex ceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\n\n## Content Production Incentives\n\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as 'Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset's amortization period.\n\n## Internal-Use Software Costs\n\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.\n\n## Parks, Resorts and Other Property\n\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n",

      "answer": "CMCSA reported that payroll costs for employees devoting time to software projects are capitalized and amortized over up to five years, indicating a strategic investment in long-term development. Meanwhile, NFLX's 2023 report shows that personnel-related costs contributed $21 million to the increase in their Technology and Development Expenses, which include payroll, stock-based compensation, and other related expenses for technology personnel. While CMCSA capitalizes these costs, NFLX expenses them directly, making the $21 million increase a direct operational cost rather than a long-term asset.",

      "answer": "Disney reported that its licensed Television Programming Rights had a total value of $6,351 million as of September 30, 2023. Comcast noted that intersegment transactions between its Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Media segments involve revenue recognition timing differences, where the Media segment recognizes profits from content licenses at a point in time, while the Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment recognizes the associated costs over the license period. This timing mismatch results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, deferring the profit recognition until the content is used. Therefore, while Disney's upfront licensing value is clear, Comcast's financial impact from acquiring these rights is influenced by the staggered recognition of revenue and costs across its internal segments.",

      "answer": "T's Communications Segment accounted for substantially all of its segment operating income in 2024 and 2023, indicating a high concentration risk in one business area. In contrast, VZ evaluates performance across two distinct reportable segments\u2014Consumer and Business\u2014based on segment operating income, with decision-making focused on resource allocation across these segments. This suggests that T faces greater business risk from potential disruptions in the Communications market compared to VZ's more diversified exposure across consumer and business telecommunications services.",

Segment Information\n\n## Reportable Segments\n\nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker's (CODM ) assessment of segment performance.\n\nThe Company's CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM  uses segment operating income to allocate resources (including employees, financial or capital resources) and to assess performance during the monthly and quarterly financial strategic review process. When assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources, the CODM  focuses on evaluating whether revenues generated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate return on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM  using segment operating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network technologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's priorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks, establishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions, branding matters and people management.\n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:",

      "question": "How does the impact of tax incentives on content amortization for NFLX in 2023 compare with CMCSA's approach to recognizing tax incentives on film and television productions, given both companies' reliance on content asset valuation strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NFLX reported that tax incentives reduced content amortization on produced content by approximately $835 million, directly lowering the cost basis of content assets. This reflects a strategy where tax incentives are integrated into content asset valuation during production. Similarly, CMCSA records a receivable for production tax incentives when there is reasonable assurance of collection, with a corresponding reduction in capitalized film and television costs. This means both companies use tax incentives to lower the effective cost of content creation, which in turn affects amortization and asset valuation strategies over time.",

      "answer": "Disney's $2.3 billion service revenue growth in fiscal 2024 was partially driven by its Entertainment segment, which incurred significant programming and production costs that included amortization of capitalized production costs, licensed programming rights, and live programming expenses. These costs are central to the segment's operations and directly impact profitability. Meanwhile, Comcast also reports programming and production costs in its financial statements (Note 4), indicating that both companies treat these costs as a critical component of their media business strategies. However, while Disney details how these costs support revenue growth across its entertainment lines of business, the specific magnitude and allocation methodology of Comcast's costs remain less detailed in the provided evidence, making direct comparisons of efficiency or investment intensity difficult without further disclosure.",

Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "Disney faces significant regulatory pressures that directly impact its advertising revenue, including compliance costs and restrictions related to data privacy laws like the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and international content regulations that limit how and where content can be distributed. These constraints create a challenging environment for Disney\u2019s digital advertising growth. In contrast, Meta generates substantially all its revenue from advertising placements on its Family of Apps, which includes platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta invested $70.13 billion in its Family of Apps in 2023, underscoring its heavy dependence on this segment. This stark contrast reveals that while both companies are exposed to digital advertising risks, Disney\u2019s regulatory environment imposes more immediate constraints on monetization, whereas Meta\u2019s risk is more tied to platform dependency and long-term shifts in user behavior and ad tech innovation.",

      "answer": "CMCSA explicitly states that it does not capitalize costs related to the distribution of films or television content, such as marketing and distribution fees, and instead records these as programming and production costs. In contrast, DIS allocates distribution costs across its Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer platforms based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows, with distribution costs included in operating expenses for both segments. DIS also notes that its flexible distribution strategy\u2014such as shifting the timing or platform of content exploitation\u2014directly impacts the allocation of these costs across segments. This suggests that while CMCSA excludes distribution costs from capitalization entirely, DIS actively allocates these costs depending on evolving distribution strategies, making the two companies' treatment of distribution costs fundamentally different in both timing and methodology.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs  are  based  on  anticipated  release  patterns  and  distribution  strategies,  public  acceptance  and  historical  results  for  similar productions.  Amortization  for  content  predominantly  monetized  with  other  owned  or  licensed  content  is  recorded  based  on estimated  usage.  In  determining  the  method  of  amortization  and  estimated  life  of  an  acquired  film  or  television  library,  we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do  not  capitalize  costs  related  to  the  distribution  of  a  film  in  movie  theaters  or  the  licensing  or  sale  of  a  film  or  television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe may enter  into  cofinancing  arrangements  with  third  parties  to  jointly  finance  or  distribute  certain  of  our  film  productions. Cofinancing  arrangements  can  take  various  forms,  but  in  most  cases  involve  the  grant  of  an  economic  interest  in  a  film  to  an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor's  interest  in  the  profit  or  loss  of  the  film  is  recorded  as  either  a  charge  or  a  benefit,  respectively,  in  programming  and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and  record  an  impairment  charge  to  the  extent  the  unamortized  costs  exceed  the  fair  value.  Owned  content  is  assessed  either individually  or  in  identified  film  groups,  for  content  predominantly  monetized  on  an  individual  basis  or  with  other  content, respectively.  The  substantial  majority  of  our  owned  content  is  evaluated  for  impairment  on  an  individual  title  basis.  Licensed content that  is  not  part  of  a  film  group  is  generally  assessed  in  packages,  channels  or  dayparts. A  daypart  is  an  aggregation  of programs  broadcast  during  a  particular  time  of  day  or  programs  of  a  similar  type.  Licensed  content  is  tested  for  impairment primarily  on  a  channel,  network  or  platform  basis,  with  the  exception  of  our  broadcast  networks  and  owned  local  broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative  value.  Estimated  relative  value  is  generally  based  on  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  nature  of  and  potential  revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract.

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

      "question": "How do the distribution cost structures of Comcast's film and television content operations compare to Disney's Experiences segment, particularly in terms of how each company manages these costs relative to their respective revenue-generating activities?",
      "answer": "Comcast does not directly report distribution costs for its film and television content as a separate line item, but it explicitly states that it does not capitalize costs related to the distribution of films in movie theaters or licensing, which primarily include marketing and distribution expenses. In contrast, Disney's Experiences segment includes 'distribution costs' as a significant expense category, specifically tied to the logistics and delivery of theme park admissions, merchandise, hotel operations, and cruise vacations. While Disney incurs distribution costs across its physical and retail operations, Comcast focuses on content amortization and impairment charges tied to owned and licensed content, without directly linking distribution expenses to revenue-generating activities in the same way. This highlights a structural difference in how each company manages distribution cost exposure in alignment with their core business models.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Distribution Costs: CMCSA explicitly states that it does not capitalize distribution-related costs (e.g., marketing and licensing logistics) and instead treats them as operating expenses separate from content amortization or film cost capitalization.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Telev ision Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned from these customers related to existing agreements is equal  to  less  than 10%  of  our  annual  Residential  Connectivity  &amp;  Platforms  revenue  and  will  generally  be  recognized  within 24  months.  Sales  commissions  are generally expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a year. Sales commissions for the international customers under contract are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\nOur services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as wireless gateways and set-top boxes, that are generally considered part of our services for revenue recognition. We recognize revenue from the sale of devices, including wireless devices and Sky G lass smart televisions, when they are transferred to the customer. Under an equipment installment plan, customers typically have the option to finance wireless devices and Sky G lass smart televisions interest-free over 24 months, and up to 48 months for international customers. Equipment installment plan receivables under these arrangements are recorded net of imputed interest when the devices are transferred to the customer.\n\nWe also have arrangements to sell certain DTC streaming services to our customers. We have concluded we are the sales agent in these arrangements, and we record net commission revenue as earned, which is generally as customers are billed on a monthly basis, within domestic broadband and international connectivity revenue.\n\nUnder the terms of our domestic cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay the cable franchising authority an amount based on gross video revenue. We generally pass these and other similar fees through to our domestic customers and classify these fees in the respective Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms services revenue, with the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses.\n\n## Advertising\n\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising and technology, tools and solutions relating to advertising businesses. As part of distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to advertisers. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our owned Sky-branded entertainment television networks and our digital platforms. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to the third parties in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions.\n\nWe have determined that a contract exists for our advertising sales arrangements once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or delivered within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally  require  payment  within 30  to 60  days  from  when  advertisements  are  aired  or  delivered.  We  also  provide  technology,  tools,  data-driven  services  and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate the more effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences and recognize revenue when these services are provided.\n\n## Business Services Connectivity Segment\n\nBusiness Services Connectivity generates revenue from subscribers to a variety of our products and services which are offered to businesses. Our connectivity service offerings for small business locations in the United States primarily include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services that are similar to those provided to our residential customers and include certain other features specific to businesses. Our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises also include ethernet network services, advanced voice services and a software-defined networking product. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the impact of tax incentives on content amortization differ between NFLX and DIS, given their respective amortization strategies and incentive recognition policies?",
      "answer": "NFLX amortizes content based on estimated viewing patterns and received $899 million in tax incentives in 2024, which reduced the cost basis of content assets and therefore lowered amortization expenses over time. In contrast, DIS recognizes tax incentives as a reduction to content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection, which then reduces programming and production costs over the asset's amortization period. DIS uses a straight-line amortization method for acquired film and television libraries over 20 years, while NFLX uses a consumption-based method tied to viewing trends. This means that while both companies benefit from tax incentives, the timing and method of recognizing these benefits in financial statements differ significantly due to their distinct amortization models.",

        "Hop 1: NFLX \u2192 Content Amortization: NFLX amortizes content based on estimated viewing patterns, which is subjective and sensitive to forecasted viewing hours. Auditing this process involves evaluating assumptions and data accuracy.",

        "Hop 3: Tax Incentives \u2190 DIS: DIS also receives tax incentives but recognizes them as a reduction to content costs when collection is assured, impacting straight-line amortization of content assets over 20 years for acquired libraries."

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, ex cept it ex cludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title's unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the ex tent the title's unamortized costs ex ceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\n\n## Content Production Incentives\n\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as 'Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset's amortization period.\n\n## Internal-Use Software Costs\n\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.\n\n## Parks, Resorts and Other Property\n\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n",

For certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\n\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability  of  ex ercising  such  options,  we  consider  contract-based,  asset-based,  entity-based,  and  market-based  factors.  We  do  not  assume  renewals  in  our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\n\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net impairment losses of $383 million, $2.43 billion, and $2.22 billion, respectively, in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining  lease  periods,  and  discount  rates  that  reflect  the  level  of  risk  associated  with  receiving  future  cash  flows.

NBCUniversal's advertising model is directly tied to the size and composition of its viewing audience, with ad units sold across linear and digital properties. In contrast, DIS plans to produce over 270 original programs in fiscal 2023, aiming to drive both DTC platform engagement and advertising revenue through high-volume, diverse content offerings across Linear Networks and streaming. DIS also leverages its extensive content library and production volume to enhance licensing revenue.

The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations, channels, or digital platforms. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, online media and other digital sources. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur television and streaming platforms compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other cable, broadcast and premium networks, DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, and local broadcast television stations. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost is significant.\n\nOur  cable  networks  compete  with  other  cable  networks  and  programming  providers  for  carriage  of  their  programming  by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. Our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences for our film and television content with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position  of  our  film  and  television  studios  primarily  depends  on  the  number  of  films  and  shows  and  episodes  produced,  their distribution  and  marketing  success,  and  consumer  response.  Our  film  and  television  studios  also  compete  to  obtain  creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on premium networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nTheme Parks competes with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and  recreational  activities.  To  help  maintain  the  competitiveness  of  our  theme  parks,  we  have  invested  and  continue  to  invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including the new theme parks in Beijing and Orlando.\n\n## Sky Segment\n\nSky is one of Europe's leading entertainment companies operating in six territories, including three of the largest pay television markets in Western Europe: the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. The majority of our revenue is derived from our direct-toconsumer business, which has 23.0 million customer relationships, and primarily involves the distribution of a wide array of video channels  to  both  residential  and  business  customers.  We  also  offer  broadband,  voice  and  wireless  services  individually  and  as bundled services in select countries. We own a diverse portfolio of pay television channels that feature entertainment, news, sports and movies, which are included in our subscription video services and are also licensed through various distribution partnerships to third-party video providers to reach an additional 3 million households. We also generate revenue from the licensing of owned and licensed programming to third-party video providers and from the sale of advertising.\n\n## Direct-to-Consumer\n\n## Video\n\nOur  direct-to-home  ('DTH')  video  services  are  delivered  primarily  through  a  combination  of  both  satellite  transmission  and broadband connections that are marketed under the Sky brand in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Austria.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMany of these competitors also have significant financial resources.\n\n## Voice\n\nCable Communications competes with wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, including incumbent local exchange carriers  ('ILECs')  and  competitive  local  exchange  carriers  ('CLECs'),  and  other  internet-based  and  VoIP  service  providers. Certain wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, such as the ILECs AT&amp;T and Verizon, have longstanding customer relationships,  and  extensive  existing  facilities  and  network  rights-of-way. A  few  CLECs  also  have  existing  local  networks  and significant  financial  resources.  In  addition,  we  are  increasingly  competing  with  other  telecommunications  service  providers  as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internet-based phone services.\n\n## Wireless\n\nCable  Communications competes with national  wireless  service  providers  in  the  United  States,  including AT&amp;T, T-Mobile  and Verizon,  which  offer  wireless  service  on  both  a  stand-alone  basis  or  along  with  other  services  as  bundled  offerings,  as  well  as regional wireless service providers.\n\n## Business Services\n\nCable  Communications  primarily  competes  with  a  variety  of  wireline  telecommunications  companies,  including  ILECs  and CLECs, and wide area network managed service providers. These companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier's network. We also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses and VoIP companies that target businesses of all sizes.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCable Communications competes for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital, radio and print media. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by declines in audience ratings and television viewership  and  difficulty  in  measuring  fragmented  audiences.  Cable  Communications  advertising  is  sold  to  local,  regional  and national advertisers, and competition is affected by the market conditions in the specific geographies in which we operate.\n\n## NBCUniversal Segments\n\nNBCUniversal  is  one  of  the  world's  leading  media  and  entertainment  companies  that  develops,  produces  and  distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks in the United States and Asia.\n\n## Media Segment\n\nNBCUniversal's television and streaming platforms primarily comprise our Media segment, including:\n\n- National, regional and international cable networks\n- NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations\n- Peacock, our DTC streaming service\n\nNBCUniversal distributes  a  wide  variety  of  content  to  appeal  to  consumers  with  varying  preferences  across  demographics  and geographies through our portfolio of television networks and streaming platforms. This content includes programming owned by NBCUniversal and by third parties who license it to us for distribution.\n\nMedia  segment  revenue  is  primarily  generated  from  the  sale  of  advertising  on  our  television  networks,  Peacock  and  digital properties, and from the distribution of our television and streaming platform programming.\n\nOur advertising sales are affected by the prices we charge for each advertising unit, which are generally based on the size and demographics of our viewing audiences, audience ratings on our television networks, the number of advertising units we can place in our programming and on our digital properties, and our ability to sell our advertising across our platforms.\n\nWe market and distribute cable network programming in the United States and internationally to multichannel video providers, including  both  traditional  providers  of  linear  programming  and  virtual  providers  who  provide  streaming  services  for  linear programming.  We  also  receive  fees  from  multichannel  video  providers  under  NBC  and  Telemundo  retransmission  consent agreements and associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. Our programming distribution agreements are generally multiyear agreements with revenue based on the number of subscribers",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

      "question": "How does the $534 million actuarial loss at VZ in 2023, driven by an increase in healthcare cost trend rate assumptions for postretirement benefit plans, compare to the net actuarial loss of $190 million reported under Postretirement Medical Plans at DIS, and what does this reveal about the relative actuarial risk exposure in their postretirement healthcare obligations?",
      "answer": "VZ experienced a $534 million actuarial loss in 2023 due to an increase in healthcare cost trend rate assumptions for postretirement benefit plans, reflecting rising healthcare liability risks. In contrast, DIS reported a net actuarial loss of only $190 million for its Postretirement Medical Plans, indicating a much smaller exposure to such risks. Additionally, DIS projects relatively stable postretirement medical benefit payments through 2034, with only $335 million expected from 2030\u20132034. This contrast suggests that VZ faces significantly greater near-term actuarial risk tied to healthcare cost inflation in its postretirement benefits compared to DIS.",

      "question": "Given Disney's increased operating loss in its Direct-to-Consumer segment driven by higher Disney+ costs, how does Warner Bros. Discovery's DTC subscription revenue growth position it strategically in the streaming market?",
      "answer": "Disney's Direct-to-Consumer segment reported an operating loss of $4,015 million in 2022, up from $1,679 million in 2021, driven by higher losses at Disney+ due to increased technology and distribution costs, as well as elevated marketing expenses ($1,325 million increase in SG&A). Meanwhile, WarnerMedia's DTC subscription revenues grew to $7,723 million in 2021 from $6,090 million in 2020, reflecting expansion of domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers. This contrast suggests Warner Bros. Discovery was able to grow its DTC revenue during a period when Disney's streaming operations were becoming increasingly costly and unprofitable, potentially giving it a stronger near-term strategic position in the competitive streaming landscape.",

The increase in 2021 was primarily due to increases in content and other, reflecting the partial recovery from prior-year impacts of the pandemic, and also in subscription revenues. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower content and advertising revenues, which were negatively impacted by the pandemic, partially offset by higher subscription revenues.\n\nSubscription revenues increased in 2021 and 2020, reflecting growth of DTC domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and the May 2020 acquisition of the remaining interest in HBO Latin America Group.

      "question": "How does the $1.785 billion negative Adjusted EBITDA in Comcast's Corporate and Other segment compare to AT&T's $1.306 billion EBITDA loss in its Corporate and Other segment as indicators of each company's corporate overhead efficiency and pandemic-related cost pressures?",
      "answer": "Comcast's Corporate and Other segment reported a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $1.785 billion in 2022, compared to AT&T's Corporate and Other segment, which reported an EBITDA loss of $1.306 billion during the same period. Both segments reflect significant corporate overhead costs, but Comcast's larger negative Adjusted EBITDA suggests higher cost pressures or less efficiency in its corporate operations relative to AT&T. This comparison is further contextualized by Comcast's disclosure that its theme parks and sports programming disruptions due to the pandemic had a continued negative impact on financial performance, which may have exacerbated corporate-level losses.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten to fifteen years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. M oreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. A s a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network.\n\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitativ e  assessment  to  determine  whether  it  is  necessary  to  perform  a  quantitative  impairment  test.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.\n\nAs part of our qualitative assessment we consider several factors including the enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA  margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitativ e assessment. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests.\n\nOur quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A  discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized.\n\nInterest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.\n\nWireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets\n\nOur intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful liv es. A ll of our intangible assets subject to amortiz ation and other long-liv ed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment, if any . We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.\n\nSee Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately , we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use.\n\nFor both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability , which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company",

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to  provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period.\n\nA summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "Disney's $487 million decrease in theatrical marketing costs contributed to improved operating results in its Content Sales/Licensing and Other category, which increased by $507 million, partly driven by higher theatrical distribution results. Since the Entertainment segment directly incurs distribution costs as part of its operating expenses, this cost reduction likely improved segment-level profitability. Given that Comcast has a stake in this same Entertainment segment, this cost optimization and its positive effect on profitability could signal improved returns or reduced risk for Comcast\u2019s investment, particularly if similar cost discipline is sustained.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "question": "How does Disney's planned production of over 270 original programs in fiscal 2023 compare to Comcast's long-term programming and production obligations, especially in light of its major multiyear sports rights commitments such as the Olympics, NFL, and European football leagues?",
      "answer": "Disney plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs in fiscal 2023, primarily for its Linear Networks and DTC platforms (chunk_1). In contrast, Comcast has significant long-term programming and production obligations, with approximately 40% of related cash payments due after five years, largely driven by NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s multiyear agreements for major sporting events such as the Olympics, NFL, and European football leagues (chunk_2 and chunk_3). While Disney\u2019s content strategy focuses on high-volume original programming across genres, Comcast\u2019s commitments reflect a more capital-intensive, long-duration approach centered on high-profile sports broadcasting rights.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 NBCUniversal: Disney's General Entertainment segment competes with NBCUniversal in content production and distribution, particularly in original programming and sports broadcasting.",

        "Hop 3: Programming and Production Expenses \u2190 CMCSA: Comcast funds these obligations through operational cash flows, with around 40% of the related payments scheduled beyond five years, indicating long-term financial commitments."

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

      "question": "How does the 7% subscriber growth in Disney's Total Hulu service compare with the dependency of Comcast's Media segment revenue on subscriber-based fees, particularly in light of the per-subscriber pricing model described in Comcast's 2023 10-K?",
      "answer": "Disney reported a 7% year-over-year increase in Total Hulu subscribers, reaching 52.0 million as of September 28, 2024. This growth indicates a strengthening subscriber base for Hulu, which is co-owned by Disney and Comcast. On the other side, Comcast's Media segment revenue is heavily dependent on subscriber-based fees, including both traditional linear TV and streaming services like Peacock, with revenue calculated based on the number of subscribers and a per-subscriber fee. Given this structure, the 7% subscriber growth in Hulu would positively impact Comcast's revenue, assuming stable per-subscriber pricing and no offsetting declines in other services. This creates a shared financial incentive between the two companies on Hulu's subscriber performance.",

      "answer": "NFLX's cost of revenues for 2024 was $1,629 thousand, primarily driven by content licensing fees and technical infrastructure costs, though specific allocations are not disclosed. In contrast, GOOGL's cost structure includes content acquisition costs (e.g., payments to YouTube content providers based on revenue or subscriber counts) and significant depreciation expenses tied to its technical infrastructure, such as network capacity and equipment. While both companies incur costs in these areas, GOOGL provides a more granular breakdown, revealing that content costs are a key component of its 'other cost of revenues,' alongside infrastructure and employee compensation expenses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NFLX \u2192 Cost of Revenues: NFLX's 2024 cost of revenues totaled $1,629 thousand, reflecting expenses related to content licensing and infrastructure, though specific allocations are not detailed.",
        "Hop 2: Cost of Revenues \u2192 Cost Structure: GOOGL's cost structure includes 'cost of revenues,' which is further broken down into TAC and 'other cost of revenues,' the latter encompassing content acquisition, infrastructure depreciation, and employee compensation.",
        "Hop 3: Cost Structure \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL's detailed cost structure reveals that content-related expenses are tied to YouTube licensing agreements, and technical infrastructure costs include depreciation, energy, and network capacity, providing a clearer view of investment priorities."

      "question": "How did the relative contribution of ticket sales to overall revenue growth differ between CMCSA's Theme Parks segment and DIS's Entertainment segment in 2023, particularly in light of CMCSA's international park recovery and DIS's stage play performance revenue?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Theme Parks segment saw revenue growth in 2023 driven by ticket sales recovery at international parks previously affected by COVID-19 restrictions, with a notable increase at the Hollywood theme park due to the opening of Super Nintendo World. Ticket sales were a core component of this growth. In contrast, for DIS's Entertainment segment, ticket sales from stage play performances contributed to 'Other revenue' but were a minor component compared to home entertainment and licensing revenue streams. While CMCSA's Theme Parks revenue is heavily dependent on ticket sales and guest attendance, DIS's ticket sales represent a smaller, more diversified revenue source within a broader entertainment portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Theme Parks Segment: CMCSA's Theme Parks segment revenue growth in 2023 was driven by ticket sales recovery, particularly at international parks affected by prior-year pandemic restrictions, with a significant boost from the Hollywood park's new attraction.",
        "Hop 2: Theme Parks Segment \u2192 Ticket Sales: Ticket sales are a primary revenue driver for CMCSA's Theme Parks segment, with fluctuations in attendance and spending directly affecting performance, especially during peak seasonal periods.",
        "Hop 3: Ticket Sales \u2190 DIS: For DIS, ticket sales from stage play performances contribute to 'Other revenue' within the Entertainment segment, indicating a much smaller and less central role compared to CMCSA's reliance on ticket sales for theme park revenue."

      "answer": "In 2020, NBCUniversal incurred severance charges as part of a cost savings initiative tied to the realignment of its television businesses, which contributed to a decrease in Comcast's (CMCSA) 2021 expenses. By the end of 2021, payments for NBCUniversal employee severance were substantially complete, and the majority of the associated cost savings were being realized in operating costs. A portion of these savings was expected to be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives. Given that Disney (DIS) competes with NBCUniversal in content production, any reinvestment by NBCUniversal in content could heighten competitive pressure on Disney\u2019s General Entertainment segment, which plans to produce or commission over 270 original programs in fiscal 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

      "answer": "CMCSA reported a 12% year-over-year decline in advertising revenue, which directly impacted their average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. This metric is critical for evaluating profitability across services, including advertising contributions. META, while not disclosing a specific percentage decline, acknowledges significant advertising revenue volatility due to infrastructure reliability issues and user engagement fluctuations. META's exposure is amplified by their $16.12 billion Reality Labs investment losses in 2023, which have directly reduced operating margins, making them more vulnerable to advertising market contractions.

      "answer": "AT&T reported a slight decline in operating revenues of 0.1% in 2024, indicating a stagnant or slightly negative growth trend. In contrast, Comcast's goodwill impairment analysis for its Media reporting unit incorporated positive revenue growth rate assumptions in its discounted cash flow model, which were evaluated by auditors as part of the fair value estimation. This suggests that Comcast's forward-looking assumptions for media revenue growth differ from AT&T's recent performance, potentially reflecting different market positioning or strategic outlooks.",

We also developed an expectation of aggregate domestic residential revenue from subscribers based on cash received during the year.  We compared those estimates to revenue recognized by the Company.\n\n## Goodwill - Refer to Note 9 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe  Company's  evaluation  of  goodwill  for  impairment  is  performed  at  the  reporting  unit  level.  To  determine  its  reporting  units,  the  Company  evaluates  the components one level below the segment level and aggregates the components if they have similar economic characteristics. The Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Media reporting unit, which involved a comparison of the fair value of the Media reporting unit to its carrying value.\n\nThe Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant judgments related to discount rates and forecasts of expected cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $58 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $20 billion was allocated to the Media reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of the Media reporting unit ex ceeded its carrying value and no impairment was recognized.\n\nWe identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the Media reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate  the  fair  value  of  the  Media  reporting  unit.  This  required  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  and  an  increased  ex tent  of  effort,  when  performing  audit procedures to evaluate management's conclusion related to the aggregation of components into a single reporting unit and the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate, revenue growth rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin included in future expected cash flows for the Media reporting unit.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures to evaluate the determination of the reporting unit as well as the discount rate, revenue growth rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin included in future expected cash flows used by management to estimate the fair value of the Media reporting unit included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over (a) the accounting policies regarding identification of the unit of account for goodwill and (b) the determination of the fair value of Media, such as controls related to management's selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows.\n- With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n- We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results in the respective years.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How do the programming cost structures of Disney's Entertainment segment and Comcast's video division compare in 2023, particularly in relation to their respective revenue models?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Disney's Entertainment segment incurs programming costs through amortization of capitalized production costs, licensed programming rights, subscriber-based fees for Hulu Live programming, production costs for live programming, participations and residual expenses, and fees paid to the Sports segment for ESPN content on ABC and Disney+. These costs are essential to support its diverse revenue streams, including subscription fees, advertising, and affiliate fees across Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer, and Content Sales/Licensing. While Disney does not disclose the total dollar amount for these programming costs, the structure indicates a heavy investment in content creation and licensing to sustain its global entertainment offerings. On the other hand, Comcast discloses that its video division incurred $18.5 billion in programming costs in 2023 (as reported in CMCSA_10k_2023.pdf), which is a significant portion of its total costs and reflects its reliance on traditional content delivery through cable and satellite platforms. This comparison highlights how Disney's diversified model emphasizes internal content production and streaming, whereas Comcast's model remains more dependent on traditional programming distribution with high fixed costs.",

        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 Entertainment Segment: Disney's Entertainment segment includes Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer services (like Disney+ and Hulu), and Content Sales/Licensing, generating revenue from subscription fees, advertising, affiliate fees, and content licensing.",

      "answer": "At META in 2023, Reality Labs accounted for 20% of total costs and expenses, with $18.02 billion of the $91.15 billion in total spending allocated to it. Meanwhile, CMCSA reported total costs and expenses of $46.275 billion in 2022, representing approximately 64% of its total revenue of $72.386 billion. This indicates that while META is directing a significant but minority portion of its resources toward future-oriented investments like the metaverse through Reality Labs, CMCSA is dedicating a larger proportion of its revenue toward operational costs, reflecting a more mature and infrastructure-heavy business model.",

        "Hop 2: Reality Labs \u2192 Costs and Expenses: Reality Labs' $18.02 billion in costs is part of META's broader $91.15 billion total spending, showing that this segment is a major but minority focus of investment.",

      "answer": "Comcast's Sky segment saw a decrease in programming and production costs in 2021, contributing to lower overall operating expenses, as noted in its 2022 10-K filing. In contrast, Disney reported significant programming and production costs across its four content creation groups\u2014Studios, General Entertainment, Sports, and International\u2014as a major component of its Direct-to-Consumer and International segment expenses. While Sky's cost reduction appears to have positively impacted Comcast's consolidated costs, Disney's spending reflects a broader investment strategy in content creation and licensing, indicating divergent cost management approaches between the two companies.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Sky Segment: Sky segment's 2021 operating expenses decreased partially due to lower programming and production costs, as stated in CMCSA's 2022 10-K.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in  the  United  States,  in  Europe  or  globally  could  adversely  affect  demand  for  any  of  our  products  and  services  and  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks.  In  particular,  the  success  of  our  theme  parks  and  theatrical  releases  largely  depends  on  consumer  demand  for  out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also cause governments and regulators to impose additional tax or product affordability regulations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as high interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\n## Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  make  acquisitions  and  investments  and  may  pursue  other  strategic  initiatives,  such  as  the  proposed  Spin-off.  In  connection  with  such acquisitions  and  strategic  initiatives,  we  may  incur  significant  or  unanticipated  ex penses,  fail  to  realize  anticipated  benefits  and  synergies,  have  difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nFluctuations in our  Google  Cloud rev enues hav e been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of rev enues and operating expenses.

Certain  of  our  costs  and  expenses,  including  those  associated  with  the  operation  of  our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues primarily includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n- employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content rev iew and customer and product support;\n- inv entory and other costs related to the dev ices we sell; and\n- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\n\nTAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the adv ertiser rev enues from ads serv ed on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "question": "How do the distribution cost structures in Comcast's content monetization strategy compare to Disney's Sports segment operating expenses, particularly in relation to their respective amortization approaches for licensed sports rights?",
      "answer": "Comcast explicitly states that it does not capitalize costs related to the distribution of films or licensing, such as marketing and distribution, and instead focuses on amortizing owned and licensed content based on usage or revenue ratios. In contrast, Disney's Sports segment includes distribution costs as a core component of its operating expenses alongside programming and production costs, which encompass amortization of licensed sports rights. Disney recognizes these sports rights costs over the contract term based on relative value, indicating a more integrated approach to amortization that factors in distribution as part of the broader cost structure. This highlights a fundamental difference in how the two companies treat distribution costs in relation to amortization strategies for licensed content, particularly in the sports domain.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Distribution Costs: Comcast explicitly excludes distribution and licensing costs (e.g., marketing, distribution) from capitalization, focusing amortization on owned and licensed content based on usage or revenue ratios.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Telev ision Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

The current decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products or subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC products, while also increasing the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as current inflation in the domestic and global energy sector and other pronounced price increases generally and in certain other sectors, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. A decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our business plans, such as our plans to realign our cost structure and for the new DTC ad-supported service, pricing structure and price increases. In addition, actions to reduce inflation, including raising interest rates, increase our cost of borrowing, which in turn could make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments on favorable terms. Further, global economic conditions may impact foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar has adversely impacted the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and may reduce international demand for our products and services. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar may increase our labor, supply or other costs in non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries. Broader supply chain delays, such as those currently impacting global distribution may further exacerbate current inflationary pressures and impact our ability to sell and deliver goods or otherwise disrupt our operations. The adverse impact on our businesses of the decline in economic conditions will depend, in part, on its severity and duration and our ability to mitigate the impacts of this decline on our businesses will be limited.\n\n## Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.\n\nThe media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. This trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels, including for a number of our networks. In addition, theater-going to watch movies currently is, and may continue to be, below pre-COVID-19 levels. Declines in linear viewership have resulted in decreased advertising revenue. In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement changes to our business models, most recently by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, initiating plans to again reorganize our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies, and developing next generation storytelling offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, next generation storytelling offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution may increase the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. We expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources, particularly as we expand our DTC offerings. To date we have experienced significant losses in our DTC businesses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be profitable or as profitable as our existing or historic business models.\n\n## Misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment, travel and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.\n\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create compelling content, which may be distributed, among other ways, through broadcast, cable, internet or cellular technology, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products. Such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks, resorts, cruise ships and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for public or out-of-home",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMany of these competitors also have significant financial resources.\n\n## Voice\n\nCable Communications competes with wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, including incumbent local exchange carriers  ('ILECs')  and  competitive  local  exchange  carriers  ('CLECs'),  and  other  internet-based  and  VoIP  service  providers. Certain wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, such as the ILECs AT&amp;T and Verizon, have longstanding customer relationships,  and  extensive  existing  facilities  and  network  rights-of-way. A  few  CLECs  also  have  existing  local  networks  and significant  financial  resources.  In  addition,  we  are  increasingly  competing  with  other  telecommunications  service  providers  as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internet-based phone services.\n\n## Wireless\n\nCable  Communications competes with national  wireless  service  providers  in  the  United  States,  including AT&amp;T, T-Mobile  and Verizon,  which  offer  wireless  service  on  both  a  stand-alone  basis  or  along  with  other  services  as  bundled  offerings,  as  well  as regional wireless service providers.\n\n## Business Services\n\nCable  Communications  primarily  competes  with  a  variety  of  wireline  telecommunications  companies,  including  ILECs  and CLECs, and wide area network managed service providers. These companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier's network. We also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses and VoIP companies that target businesses of all sizes.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCable Communications competes for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital, radio and print media. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by declines in audience ratings and television viewership  and  difficulty  in  measuring  fragmented  audiences.  Cable  Communications  advertising  is  sold  to  local,  regional  and national advertisers, and competition is affected by the market conditions in the specific geographies in which we operate.\n\n## NBCUniversal Segments\n\nNBCUniversal  is  one  of  the  world's  leading  media  and  entertainment  companies  that  develops,  produces  and  distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks in the United States and Asia.\n\n## Media Segment\n\nNBCUniversal's television and streaming platforms primarily comprise our Media segment, including:\n\n- National, regional and international cable networks\n- NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations\n- Peacock, our DTC streaming service\n\nNBCUniversal distributes  a  wide  variety  of  content  to  appeal  to  consumers  with  varying  preferences  across  demographics  and geographies through our portfolio of television networks and streaming platforms. This content includes programming owned by NBCUniversal and by third parties who license it to us for distribution.\n\nMedia  segment  revenue  is  primarily  generated  from  the  sale  of  advertising  on  our  television  networks,  Peacock  and  digital properties, and from the distribution of our television and streaming platform programming.\n\nOur advertising sales are affected by the prices we charge for each advertising unit, which are generally based on the size and demographics of our viewing audiences, audience ratings on our television networks, the number of advertising units we can place in our programming and on our digital properties, and our ability to sell our advertising across our platforms.\n\nWe market and distribute cable network programming in the United States and internationally to multichannel video providers, including  both  traditional  providers  of  linear  programming  and  virtual  providers  who  provide  streaming  services  for  linear programming.  We  also  receive  fees  from  multichannel  video  providers  under  NBC  and  Telemundo  retransmission  consent agreements and associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. Our programming distribution agreements are generally multiyear agreements with revenue based on the number of subscribers",

The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations, channels, or digital platforms. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, online media and other digital sources. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur television and streaming platforms compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other cable, broadcast and premium networks, DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, and local broadcast television stations. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost is significant.\n\nOur  cable  networks  compete  with  other  cable  networks  and  programming  providers  for  carriage  of  their  programming  by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. Our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences for our film and television content with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position  of  our  film  and  television  studios  primarily  depends  on  the  number  of  films  and  shows  and  episodes  produced,  their distribution  and  marketing  success,  and  consumer  response.  Our  film  and  television  studios  also  compete  to  obtain  creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on premium networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nTheme Parks competes with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and  recreational  activities.  To  help  maintain  the  competitiveness  of  our  theme  parks,  we  have  invested  and  continue  to  invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including the new theme parks in Beijing and Orlando.\n\n## Sky Segment\n\nSky is one of Europe's leading entertainment companies operating in six territories, including three of the largest pay television markets in Western Europe: the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. The majority of our revenue is derived from our direct-toconsumer business, which has 23.0 million customer relationships, and primarily involves the distribution of a wide array of video channels  to  both  residential  and  business  customers.  We  also  offer  broadband,  voice  and  wireless  services  individually  and  as bundled services in select countries. We own a diverse portfolio of pay television channels that feature entertainment, news, sports and movies, which are included in our subscription video services and are also licensed through various distribution partnerships to third-party video providers to reach an additional 3 million households. We also generate revenue from the licensing of owned and licensed programming to third-party video providers and from the sale of advertising.\n\n## Direct-to-Consumer\n\n## Video\n\nOur  direct-to-home  ('DTH')  video  services  are  delivered  primarily  through  a  combination  of  both  satellite  transmission  and broadband connections that are marketed under the Sky brand in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Austria.

      "question": "How does the impact of tax incentives on content amortization differ between NFLX and CMCSA, given their respective amortization methodologies and eligibility for such incentives?",
      "answer": "NFLX reduces its content amortization by $899 million in 2024 due to tax incentives earned on qualified production spend, which directly lowers the cost basis of content assets. This reduction is integrated into NFLX\u2019s amortization model based on estimated viewing patterns derived from historical and forecasted viewing hours. CMCSA also benefits from tax incentives, recording a receivable when there is reasonable assurance of collection, with a corresponding reduction in capitalized film and television costs and related amortization. However, CMCSA\u2019s amortization methodology differs, using the individual film forecast computation method for content monetized individually and estimated usage for content monetized with other content. Therefore, while both companies benefit from tax incentives that reduce amortization, the magnitude and application differ due to distinct amortization models and incentive eligibility criteria.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "T's Latin America segment generated $2,162 million in wireless service revenue, which contributed to less than 1% of T's total segment operating income despite accounting for 3% of total segment revenues. This indicates a low operating efficiency for the Latin America segment. Comparatively, Disney's total segment operating income was $15,601 million on total segment revenues of $91,361 million, equating to an operating income margin of approximately 17.1%, which is significantly higher than the minimal contribution from T's Latin America segment.",

Our efforts to maintain and grow our customer base and make improvements to our prepaid business, if successful, are also expected to benefit our wireless service revenue. We expect Fios revenue to benefit from growth in our Fios customer base and an ongoing demand for higher speed internet connections, which offsets the impact of the shift from bundled wireline services to standalone internet service.\n\nIn our Business segment, we expect wireless service revenue to expand, driven by growth from an increase in wireless volumes and strong FWA  revenue. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth and that legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures.\n\n## Other Trends\n\nWe are focused on achieving profitable growth as we continue to deliver strong revenues and undertake initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including through A I-driven technologies.\n\nWe expect that our ability to generate cash flows will benefit from our expected service revenue growth, despite the moderate expected increase in our 2025 capital program compared to 2024. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information on our capital program.\n\nIn the course of business, we make promotional equipment offers to attract and retain customers. In 2024, the growth of our wireless service revenue was unfavorably impacted by the amortization of wireless equipment sales and promotions. We expect these pressures to continue and increase in 2025. In addition, in 2023 and 2024, we had fewer phone upgrades compared to prior years. T o the extent upgrade volumes increase in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe use the net cash generated from our operations to invest in new businesses and spectrum, fund expansion and modernization of our networks, pay dividends, service and repay external financing and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary , from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance is $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally , and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity . See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout M arket Risk\" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.\n\nWe expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, including, for example, to complete our acquisition of Frontier, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our ex ternal financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nOur 2025 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding and adding capacity and density to our core networks, the ongoing deployment of C-Band spectrum, and advancing our network architecture. It will also support our broadband expansion plans including the launch of our fixed wireless access solution for multi-dwelling units. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2025 capital program to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion.\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nWe have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n\n- Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $142.2 billion, of which $21.7 billion (including $3.3 billion of unsecured debt) are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Related interest payments are $66.3 billion, of which $5.8 billion, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.",

Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. under the V erizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE networks as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our V erizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.\n\nCustomers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. The Consumer segment also offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches.\n\nIn addition to wireless services and equipment for retail customers, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis.\n\nThe Consumer segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $102.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 1.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Consumer segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics.\n\n## Verizon Business G roup\n\nOur  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including  FWA   broadband,  data,  video  and  advanced communication services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world.\n\nThe Business segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $29.5 billion, a decrease of $591 million, or 2.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Business segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nCorporate and other primarily includes device insurance programs, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that support our  strategic  initiativ es,  as  well  as  unallocated  corporate  ex penses,  certain  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  related  costs  and  interest  and  financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated or used in assessing segment performance due to their nature. A lthough such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results and therefore are included in the chief operating decision maker's assessment of segment performance.

      "answer": "AT&T reported $7,723 million in DTC subscription revenues in 2021, showing strong growth from prior years, which was supported by HBO Max expansion and intercompany relationships with the Communications segment. In contrast, Disney reported a $4,015 million DTC operating loss in 2022, driven by higher technology and distribution costs at Disney+, increased marketing expenses, and a higher loss at ESPN+. The divergence can be explained by AT&T\u2019s focused DTC strategy centered on premium content monetization with relatively controlled costs, versus Disney\u2019s aggressive market expansion and investment in technology and marketing, which significantly increased operating expenses and led to a larger operating loss.",

We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we hav e the power to direct activ ities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and hav e the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits.  If we are not the primary beneficiary in a  VIE, we account for the inv estment or other v ariable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\n\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment is comprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets currently in serv ice, and assets not yet in serv ice.  T echnical  infrastructure  includes  data  center  land,  buildings  and  leasehold  improv ements,  and  serv ers  and  network  equipment.  Office  space includes office land, buildings and leasehold improv ements. Assets not yet in serv ice are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data center buildings and serv ers in the process of construction or assembly.\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets are ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method ov er the estimated useful liv es of the assets, which we regularly ev aluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and utilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings ov er periods of sev en  to 40 years.  We depreciate serv ers  and  network  equipment generally ov er a period of six years.  We depreciate corporate and other assets ov er periods of two  to 25  years.  We depreciate leasehold improv ements ov er the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful liv es of the assets. Land is not depreciated.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We ev aluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relativ e fair v alue allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components.  Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\n\nCertain lease agreements contain v ariable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\n\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present v alue of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present v alue of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily  determinable.  Our  incremental  borrowing  rate  is  estimated  to  approximate  the  interest  rate  on  a  collateralized  basis  with  similar  terms  and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentiv es.\n\nLease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.\n\nOperating lease expense (excluding v ariable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the lease term.  Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis ov er the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recov erable.

      "answer": "Verizon used $4.4 billion in 2023 to prepay and repay asset-backed, long-term borrowings as part of its broader $10.6 billion cash outflow for debt repayment, reflecting a strategy to reduce debt burden and manage financial risk. In contrast, Netflix reported $4.4 billion in current content liabilities as of December 31, 2024, which represents obligations related to content acquisition, licensing, and production, indicating a strategic investment in content to drive subscriber growth. While both figures are numerically identical, they represent opposite financial flows: Verizon's outflow reflects liability reduction, whereas Netflix's inflow reflects committed spending to fuel business growth.",

      "answer": "VZ contributed $200 million to its qualified pension plan in 2023 as part of a liability-driven strategy aimed at better aligning assets with projected benefit obligations. This strategy is designed to reduce the risk of underfunding by matching the interest rate sensitivity of assets with liabilities. Meanwhile, DIS disclosed that a 1 percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase its projected benefit obligations by $2,430 million, highlighting the significant sensitivity of these obligations to actuarial assumptions. Therefore, VZ\u2019s contribution, while meaningful, is relatively small compared to the potential volatility in obligations due to discount rate fluctuations, underscoring the importance of their asset-liability matching approach.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Telev ision Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

This compares to AT&T's overall operating loss of $88 million in 2024, down sharply from an operating income of $1,289 million in 2023 \u2014 a year-over-year decline of $1,377 million. The scale of CMCSA's corporate-level losses is nearly double the amount of AT&T's entire operating income erosion, suggesting that corporate overhead is a significant cost center for CMCSA, even as AT&T faces steeper declines in core operating performance.",

      "answer": "In 2024, DIS experienced an actuarial loss primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate its benefit obligations compared to the prior year, which increased its reported pension liabilities. Conversely, VZ saw a $1.4 billion actuarial gain in 2024, driven by an increase in its weighted-average discount rate from 5.0% to 5.8% for pension plans and from 5.0% to 5.6% for postretirement plans, which reduced its reported liabilities. This divergence reveals that both companies are significantly exposed to interest rate risk, but their financial outcomes moved in opposite directions based on the direction of the discount rate change. Investors should note that future decreases in discount rates would negatively impact both companies, increasing liabilities and reducing earnings, while increases would have the opposite effect.",

      "question": "How does the 7% year-over-year growth in Total Hulu subscribers impact Disney's distribution revenue compared to Comcast's reliance on per-subscriber fees from its television networks, given both companies' exposure to subscriber-driven revenue models?",
      "answer": "Disney's Total Hulu subscriber base grew by 7% year-over-year to 52.0 million, which directly enhances its distribution revenue from Hulu's SVOD and live services. In contrast, Comcast's Media segment receives distribution fees based on the number of subscribers receiving programming on its television networks, including per-subscriber fees from multichannel video providers. This indicates that while both companies depend on subscriber counts, Disney's growth in Hulu subscriptions could provide more scalable digital revenue, whereas Comcast's model is more reliant on traditional and virtual multichannel distribution agreements.",

In contrast, CMCSA explicitly excludes theatrical and licensing distribution costs (e.g., marketing and distribution fees) from capitalized film costs, allowing it to preserve capital for reinvestment in platforms like Peacock. The flexible cost allocation approach described in DIS_10k_2022 shows that marketing and distribution costs for DTC are recognized in the initial exploitation platform, meaning CMCSA can better manage expense timing and channel more funds toward platform development. These differing accounting treatments mean T faces more immediate margin pressure in scaling DTC, while CMCSA has greater financial flexibility to reinvest in streaming growth.",

Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding. (2)\n\nIncludes amortization of intangibles related to TFCF equity investees. (3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs  are  based  on  anticipated  release  patterns  and  distribution  strategies,  public  acceptance  and  historical  results  for  similar productions.  Amortization  for  content  predominantly  monetized  with  other  owned  or  licensed  content  is  recorded  based  on estimated  usage.  In  determining  the  method  of  amortization  and  estimated  life  of  an  acquired  film  or  television  library,  we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do  not  capitalize  costs  related  to  the  distribution  of  a  film  in  movie  theaters  or  the  licensing  or  sale  of  a  film  or  television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe may enter  into  cofinancing  arrangements  with  third  parties  to  jointly  finance  or  distribute  certain  of  our  film  productions. Cofinancing  arrangements  can  take  various  forms,  but  in  most  cases  involve  the  grant  of  an  economic  interest  in  a  film  to  an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor's  interest  in  the  profit  or  loss  of  the  film  is  recorded  as  either  a  charge  or  a  benefit,  respectively,  in  programming  and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and  record  an  impairment  charge  to  the  extent  the  unamortized  costs  exceed  the  fair  value.  Owned  content  is  assessed  either individually  or  in  identified  film  groups,  for  content  predominantly  monetized  on  an  individual  basis  or  with  other  content, respectively.  The  substantial  majority  of  our  owned  content  is  evaluated  for  impairment  on  an  individual  title  basis.  Licensed content that  is  not  part  of  a  film  group  is  generally  assessed  in  packages,  channels  or  dayparts. A  daypart  is  an  aggregation  of programs  broadcast  during  a  particular  time  of  day  or  programs  of  a  similar  type.  Licensed  content  is  tested  for  impairment primarily  on  a  channel,  network  or  platform  basis,  with  the  exception  of  our  broadcast  networks  and  owned  local  broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative  value.  Estimated  relative  value  is  generally  based  on  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  nature  of  and  potential  revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment.  When  cash  payments,  including  advanced  payments,  exceed  the  relative  value  of  the  sports  rights  delivered,  we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented with licensed content.\n\n## Note 5: Income Taxes\n\n## Income Before Income Taxes\n\n",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

We are restructuring businesses, sunsetting legacy networks, improving customer service and ordering functions through digital transformation, sizing our support costs and staffing with current activity levels, and reassessing overall benefit costs. Cost savings and asset sales align with our focus on debt reduction.\n\nMarket Conditions The U.S. stock market experienced steady growth in 2021; however, several factors, including the global pandemic, have resulted in changes in demand in business communication services. The global pandemic has caused, and could again cause, delays in the development, manufacturing (including the sourcing of key components) and shipment of products, as well as continued tight labor market and actual or perceived inflation. Most of our products and services are not directly affected by the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods. However, we expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2022 as we respond to the competitive marketplace, especially in wireless services.\n\nIncluded on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits. Our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). We expect only minimal ERISA contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2022. Investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy, and a weakness in the equity, fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans. In addition, our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions; however, these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in 'Other income (expense) - net.' Changes in our discount rate, which are tied to changes in the bond market, and changes in the performance of equity markets, may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2022 (see 'Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates').\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW\n\nAT&amp;T subsidiaries operating within the United States are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities. AT&amp;T subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the markets where service is provided.\n\nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Telecom Act), Congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare. Nonetheless, over the ensuing two decades, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and some state regulatory commissions have maintained or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. More recently, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition.\n\n## Communications Segment\n\nInternet The FCC currently classifies fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services, subject to light-touch regulation. The D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC's current classification, although it remanded three discrete issues to the FCC for further consideration. These issues related to the effect of the FCC's decision to classify broadband services as information services on public safety, the regulation of pole attachments, and universal service support for low-income consumers through the Lifeline program. Because no party sought Supreme Court review of the D.C. Circuit's decision to uphold the FCC's classification of broadband as an information service, that decision is final.\n\nIn October 2020, the FCC adopted an order addressing the three issues remanded by the D.C. Circuit for further consideration. After considering those issues, the FCC concluded they provided no grounds to depart from its determination that fixed and mobile consumer broadband services should be classified as information services. An appeal of the FCC's remand decision is pending.\n\nSome states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that would reimpose net neutrality rules repealed by the FCC. Suits have been filed concerning such laws in California and Vermont. The California statute is now in effect, and the lawsuit regarding the Vermont statute has been stayed pending resolution of any appeal of the California lawsuit. We expect that going forward additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements.",

By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in, or repatriate cash from, those countries.\n\nOur objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.\n\nOur objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities. The amounts hedged using total return swap contracts are based on estimated liability balances.\n\nIt is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.\n\n## Value at Risk (VAR)\n\nThe Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Company's computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis increased to $395 million at October 1, 2022 from $364 million at October 2, 2021.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

These obligations are primarily tied to qualified pension plans, which hold the majority of pension assets.

In contrast, T explicitly included employee separation charges as part of its 'Certain significant items' under the Corporate and Other segment, reflecting its strategic workforce reductions tied to the divestiture of Vrio in November 2021 and the restructuring of WarnerMedia ahead of its combination with Discovery.

The services and products that we offer vary by market and utilize various technology platforms in a range of geographies. Our reportable segments are organized as follows:\n\nThe Communications segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:\n\n- Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment.\n- Business Wireline provides advanced IP-based services, as well as traditional voice and data services to business customers.\n- Consumer Wireline provides internet, including broadband fiber, and legacy telephony voice communication services to residential customers.\n\nThe WarnerMedia segment develops, produces and distributes feature films, television, gaming and other content in various physical and digital formats globally. WarnerMedia content is distributed through basic networks, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) or theatrical, TV content and games licensing. Segment results also include Xandr advertising and Otter Media Holdings (Otter Media). We disposed of substantially all Otter Media assets in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery). On December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft). (See Note 6)\n\nThe Latin America segment provides wireless services and equipment in Mexico, and prior to the November 2021 disposition of Vrio, video services in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nCorporate and Other reconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes, and includes:\n\n- Corporate , which consists of: (1) businesses no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, (2) corporate support functions, (3) impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, and (4) the reclassification of the amortization of prior service credits, which we continue to report with segment operating expenses, to consolidated 'Other income (expense) - net.' Costs previously allocated to the Video business that were retained after the transaction, net of reimbursements from DIRECTV under transition service agreements, are reported in Corporate following the transaction through 2022, to maintain comparability of our operating segment results, and while operational plans and continued cost reduction initiatives are implemented.\n- Video , which consists of our former U.S. video operations that were contributed to DIRECTV on July 31, 2021 and also includes our share of DIRECTV's earnings as equity in net income of affiliates (see Note 10).\n- Acquisition-related items , which consists of items associated with the merger and integration of acquired or divested businesses, including amortization of intangible assets.\n- Certain significant items , which includes (1) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, (2) asset impairments and abandonments, and (3) other items for which the segments are not being evaluated.\n- Eliminations and consolidations , which (1) removes transactions involving dealings between our segments, including channel distribution between WarnerMedia and Video prior to its separation, and (2) includes adjustments for our reporting of the advertising business.",

(See Note 6)\n\nOn December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) (see Note 6). We applied held-for-sale accounting for Xandr as of December 31, 2021, and continue to present the Xandr results within the WarnerMedia segment consistent with how performance was assessed and resource allocation decision were made through December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Latin America segment provides wireless services and equipment in Mexico, and prior to the November 2021 disposition of Vrio, video services in Latin America and the Caribbean. We applied held-for-sale accounting to Vrio as of June 30, 2021 and continued to present the Vrio results within the Latin America segment consistent with how performance was assessed and resource allocation decisions were made until the transaction closed.\n\nCorporate and Other reconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes, and includes:\n\n- Corporate , which consists of: (1) businesses no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, (2) corporate support functions, (3) impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, and (4) the reclassification of the amortization of prior service credits, which we continue to report with segment operating expenses, to consolidated 'Other income (expense) - net.' Costs previously allocated to the Video business that were retained after the transaction, net of reimbursements from DIRECTV under transition service agreements, are reported in Corporate following the transaction through 2022, to maintain comparability of our operating segment results, and while operational plans and continued cost reduction initiatives are implemented.\n- Video, which consists of our former U.S. video operations that were contributed to DIRECTV on July 31, 2021 and also includes our share of DIRECTV's earnings as equity in net income of affiliates (see Note 10).\n- Acquisition-related items, which consists of items associated with the merger and integration of acquired or divested businesses, including amortization of intangible assets.\n- Certain significant items, which includes (1) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, (2) asset impairments and abandonments, and (3) other items for which the segments are not being evaluated.\n- Eliminations and consolidations , which (1) removes transactions involving dealings between our segments, including channel distribution between WarnerMedia and Video and Vrio prior to separation, and (2) includes adjustments for our reporting of the advertising business.\n\n'Interest expense' and 'Other income (expense) - net' are managed only on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Business Wireline's segment operating income from T compare to the overall trend in segment operating income reported by DIS, considering the significant impairment charges impacting T's Business Wireline segment?",
      "answer": "T's Business Wireline segment operating income declined from $2,290 million in 2022 to $1,289 million in 2023, a drop of $1,001 million or 43.7%, which was influenced by impairment indicators and nonrecurring fair value measurements. In contrast, DIS reported an increase in its total segment operating income from $12,121 million in 2022 to $12,863 million in 2023, an increase of $742 million or 6.1%. This divergence highlights differing financial trajectories, with T experiencing significant segmental deterioration requiring impairment assessments, while DIS maintained overall operating income growth despite restructuring and impairment charges of $3,836 million in 2023.",

      "question": "Given Disney's $7 million exposure to equity-sensitive financial instruments in fiscal 2024 and Meta's $77.81 billion in cash and marketable securities, how might their respective approaches to financial risk management reflect differences in strategic priorities for liquidity and investment?",
      "answer": "Disney's $7 million equity-sensitive exposure, part of its broader interest and currency rate-sensitive portfolio, suggests a conservative stance on financial instrument risk, aligning with its diversified entertainment and services business model. In contrast, Meta's $77.81 billion cash position indicates a strong liquidity buffer, supporting its aggressive capital expenditures of $39.23 billion and substantial share repurchases of $29.75 billion in the same period. The significant disparity in scale and sensitivity of financial assets reflects Disney\u2019s measured risk profile versus Meta\u2019s liquidity-driven strategy to fund growth and shareholder returns in the tech sector.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 7 (Equity Sensitive Financial Instruments): Disney reports a $7 million exposure to equity-sensitive financial instruments in fiscal 2024, indicating limited risk in this category.",
        "Hop 2: 7 \u2192 Cash and Equivalents: The $7 million figure appears in the context of a broader VAR analysis, which includes cash and equivalents as part of Disney\u2019s financial instrument portfolio.",
        "Hop 3: Cash and Equivalents \u2190 META: Meta reports $77.81 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, a significantly larger and more liquid position than Disney\u2019s, supporting its capital deployment strategy."

          "chunk_text": "\nWeighted-average discount rates shown for years with interim remeasurements: 2023 and 2022 for pension benefits and 2022 for postretirement benefits. 1\n\nWeighted-average interest crediting  rates for cash balance pension prog rams relate only to the cash balance portion of total pension benefits. A 0.50% increase in the weig htedaverage interest crediting  rate would increase the pension benefit oblig ation by $150. 2\n\nWe recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in 'Other income (expense) - net' in our consolidated statements of income. These gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31 and accordingly, will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter, unless an earlier remeasurement is required. Should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions, the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future years.\n\nDiscount Rate Our assumed weighted-average discount rates for pension and postretirement benefits of 5.70% and 5.60% respectively, at December 31, 2024, reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participants. We determined our discount rates based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows. These bonds had an average rating of at least Aa3 or AA- by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, denominated in U.S. dollars, and generally not callable, convertible or index  linked. For the year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, we increased our pension discount rate by 0.70%, resulting in a decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of $1,994, and increased our postretirement discount rate by 0.60%, resulting in a decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of $317. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we decreased our pension discount rate by 0.20%, resulting in an increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of $916, and decreased our postretirement discount rate by 0.20%, resulting in an increase in our postretirement benefit obligation of $110.\n\nWe utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest components of net periodic benefit costs for pension and other postretirement benefits. Under this approach, we apply discounting using individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fix ed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These spot rates align to each of the projected benefit obligations and service cost cash flows. The service cost component relates to the active participants in the plan, so the relevant cash flows on which to apply the yield curve are considerably longer in duration on average than the total projected benefit obligation cash flows, which also include benefit payments to retirees. Interest cost is computed by multiplying each spot rate by the corresponding discounted projected benefit obligation cash flows. The full yield curve approach reduces any actuarial gains and losses based upon interest rate ex pectations (e.g., built-in gains in interest cost in an upward sloping yield curve scenario), or gains and losses merely resulting from the timing and magnitude of cash outflows associated with our benefit obligations. Neither the annual measurement of our total benefit obligations nor annual net benefit cost is affected by the full yield curve approach.",

      "answer": "The higher effective rates positively impacted DIS's affiliate revenue by offsetting subscriber losses, particularly in international ESPN and Star India segments. These effective rates also factor into VZ's debt financing costs, as issuance costs are included in the calculation of effective interest rates on debt. VZ issued $27.5 billion in commercial paper in 2024, with net proceeds affected by underwriting discounts and other issuance costs, which in turn influence the overall effective rate on the debt. This shows how revenue trends at DIS are tied through effective rates to the financing strategies and costs faced by VZ.",

      "answer": "CMCSA reported $1,252 million in investment and other income in 2023, which is added to its operating income of $23,314 million to calculate income before taxes. In contrast, UPS's segment reporting explicitly excludes investment income from operating profit, as noted in its 10-K, meaning investment income does not factor into segment-level performance evaluation. T reported an operating income of $2,873 million in 2023, which, unlike CMCSA's, does not include investment income in its operating profit metric. This highlights differing approaches to measuring core operational performance: CMCSA includes investment income in pre-tax earnings, while T and UPS exclude it from operating profit to focus on operational efficiency.",

A t December 31, 2024, our primary translation exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, A ustralian Dollar and Swedish Krona.\n\n## Cross Currency Swaps\n\nWe have entered into cross currency swaps to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and A ustralian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. The fair value of the asset of these contracts was $500 million and $762 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the liability  of these contracts was $2.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively . A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $32.1 billion and $33.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Forwards\n\nWe also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We entered into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries.\n\nAt both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was insignificant. A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total notional amount of the foreign exchange forwards was $620 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.",

We also developed an expectation of aggregate domestic residential revenue from subscribers based on cash received during the year.  We compared those estimates to revenue recognized by the Company.\n\n## Goodwill - Refer to Note 9 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe  Company's  evaluation  of  goodwill  for  impairment  is  performed  at  the  reporting  unit  level.  To  determine  its  reporting  units,  the  Company  evaluates  the components one level below the segment level and aggregates the components if they have similar economic characteristics. The Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Media reporting unit, which involved a comparison of the fair value of the Media reporting unit to its carrying value.\n\nThe Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant judgments related to discount rates and forecasts of expected cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $58 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $20 billion was allocated to the Media reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of the Media reporting unit ex ceeded its carrying value and no impairment was recognized.\n\nWe identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the Media reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate  the  fair  value  of  the  Media  reporting  unit.  This  required  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  and  an  increased  ex tent  of  effort,  when  performing  audit procedures to evaluate management's conclusion related to the aggregation of components into a single reporting unit and the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate, revenue growth rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin included in future expected cash flows for the Media reporting unit.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures to evaluate the determination of the reporting unit as well as the discount rate, revenue growth rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin included in future expected cash flows used by management to estimate the fair value of the Media reporting unit included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over (a) the accounting policies regarding identification of the unit of account for goodwill and (b) the determination of the fair value of Media, such as controls related to management's selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows.\n- With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n- We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results in the respective years.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the impact of tax incentives on content amortization differ between NFLX and DIS, given their respective amortization strategies and incentive recognition policies?",
      "answer": "NFLX amortizes content based on estimated viewing patterns and received $899 million in tax incentives in 2024, which reduced the cost basis of content assets and thus lowered amortization expenses over time. In contrast, DIS recognizes tax incentives as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection, which similarly reduces programming and production costs over the amortization period. However, DIS applies a more structured straight-line amortization approach over 20 years for acquired film and television libraries, whereas NFLX\u2019s amortization is more dynamic and tied directly to consumption-based viewing trends. This means that while both companies benefit from tax incentives, the financial impact is realized differently due to their distinct amortization methodologies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NFLX \u2192 Content Amortization: NFLX amortizes content based on estimated viewing patterns, which is subjective and sensitive to changes in actual viewing behavior. Auditing this process involves testing assumptions around viewing hours and model accuracy.",
        "Hop 2: Content Amortization \u2192 Tax Incentives: Tax incentives reduce the cost basis of content assets at NFLX, resulting in $899 million lower amortization in 2024 alone, directly impacting financial statements.",
        "Hop 3: Tax Incentives \u2190 DIS: DIS also receives tax incentives, which it applies as a reduction to content costs upon reasonable assurance of collection, affecting amortization over time, but uses a straight-line method over 20 years for acquired content."

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, ex cept it ex cludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title's unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the ex tent the title's unamortized costs ex ceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\n\n## Content Production Incentives\n\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as 'Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset's amortization period.\n\n## Internal-Use Software Costs\n\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.\n\n## Parks, Resorts and Other Property\n\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n",

      "question": "How might foreign currency fluctuations impact both Disney's international theme park operations and Comcast's Theme Parks segment, given the macroeconomic risks associated with international operations and the negative impact already observed at Comcast's international parks in 2024?",
      "answer": "Foreign currency fluctuations pose a macroeconomic risk for both Disney and Comcast in their international theme park operations. According to Disney's 2024 10-K, their international theme parks are dependent on domestic and international regulations and are exposed to risks from macroeconomic conditions, including foreign exchange rates. This aligns with Comcast\u2019s 2024 10-K, which specifically notes that its Theme Parks segment revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency in 2024. While Disney outlines the risk in general terms, Comcast experienced an actual decline in international revenue due to currency fluctuations, demonstrating how both companies are exposed to similar macroeconomic forces in their international operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## We face risks relating to misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment, travel and consumer products, which impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and the profitability of our businesses.\n\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently produce compelling creative content, which may be distributed, among other ways, through DTC platforms, broadcast, cable, theaters and used in theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products. Such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks, resorts, cruise ships and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences. Demand for certain out-of-home entertainment experiences, such as theater-going to watch movies, has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, many of our businesses depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the U.S. The success of our businesses therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to continually evolving consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the U.S. Moreover, we must often make substantial investments in content production and acquisition, acquisition of sports and programming rights, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other facilities or customer facing platforms before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance, and the market, economic or social conditions are sometimes significantly different from the ones we anticipated at the time of the investment decisions. Further, preferences of some consumers are affected by their perceptions of our position on matters of public interest, including regarding environmental and social issues. Generally, revenues from, and profitability of, each of our businesses are adversely impacted when our entertainment offerings and products, as well as our methods to make our offerings and products available to consumers, do not align with constantly evolving consumer preferences and tastes or achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\n\n## A variety of uncontrollable events disrupt our businesses, reduce demand for or consumption of our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost or reduce the profitability of providing our products and services.\n\nThe operation and profitability of our businesses and demand for and consumption of our products and services, particularly our parks and experiences businesses, are highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, including in the specific regions in which our parks and experiences businesses operate. In addition, we have extensive international operations, including our international theme parks and resorts, which are dependent on domestic and international regulations consistent with trade and investment in those regions. The operation of our businesses and the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for and consumption of our other entertainment products, is subject to significant adverse impact in the U.S., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: health concerns; adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term climate change, including longer and more regular excessive heat conditions, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, droughts, tsunamis and earthquakes); international, political or military developments, including trade and other international disputes and social unrest; macroeconomic conditions, including a decline in economic activity, inflation and foreign exchange rates; and terrorist attacks. These events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs, supply chain disruptions and malware and other cyber-related attacks or intrusions or other widespread computing, telecommunications or payment processing failures, from time to time have disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our ability to provide our products and services or in certain instances may affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage with respect to some of these events. An incident or other event that affected our property directly, including a security incident, earthquake or hurricane, would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could result in closure of impacted operations or have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities. Moreover, the costs of protecting against such incidents reduces the profitability of our operations.\n\nFor example, COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our businesses in a number of ways, including the closure of our theme parks and resorts, suspension of cruise ship sailings and guided tours, delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled, theatrical releases and disruptions in the production and availability of content, significantly reducing revenues across all of our segments. Certain of our business operations have been temporarily disrupted by payment processing outages and widespread computing failures. Hurricanes, such as Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which in the case of Hurricane Milton caused Walt Disney World Resort theme parks in Florida to close for one full and partial day, have impacted the operations and profitability of Walt Disney World Resort and may do so in the future. The Company has paused certain operations in certain regions, including in response to sanctions, trade restrictions and related developments and the profitability of certain operations has been impacted as a result of events in the corresponding regions.\n\nIn addition, we derive affiliate fees and royalties from the distribution of our programming, sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties, and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the Company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. The profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely impacted by the significant contraction of distribution channels for our products and services,",

While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten to fifteen years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. M oreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. A s a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network.\n\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitativ e  assessment  to  determine  whether  it  is  necessary  to  perform  a  quantitative  impairment  test.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.\n\nAs part of our qualitative assessment we consider several factors including the enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA  margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitativ e assessment. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests.\n\nOur quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A  discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized.\n\nInterest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.\n\nWireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets\n\nOur intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful liv es. A ll of our intangible assets subject to amortiz ation and other long-liv ed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment, if any . We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.\n\nSee Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately , we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use.\n\nFor both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability , which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company",

These unallocated costs indicate a strategic investment focus in centralized innovation and corporate initiatives, which contrasts with T\u2019s limited reliance on Latin America for income.

Given that reductions in income tax expense generally lead to a lower effective tax rate\u2014as seen in JPM\u2019s 2023 results where such reductions offset other rate increases\u2014it is notable that GOOGL anticipates a different trajectory, possibly due to changes in income mix, regulatory impacts, or reduced tax benefits.",

In contrast, AT&T's overall operating revenues slightly declined by $92 million (-0.1%) year-over-year, with its Communications segment (which includes consumer services) decreasing by $386 million (-0.3%).

Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. under the V erizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE networks as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our V erizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.\n\nCustomers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. The Consumer segment also offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches.\n\nIn addition to wireless services and equipment for retail customers, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis.\n\nThe Consumer segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $102.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 1.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Consumer segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics.\n\n## Verizon Business G roup\n\nOur  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including  FWA   broadband,  data,  video  and  advanced communication services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world.\n\nThe Business segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $29.5 billion, a decrease of $591 million, or 2.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Business segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nCorporate and other primarily includes device insurance programs, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that support our  strategic  initiativ es,  as  well  as  unallocated  corporate  ex penses,  certain  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  related  costs  and  interest  and  financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated or used in assessing segment performance due to their nature. A lthough such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results and therefore are included in the chief operating decision maker's assessment of segment performance.

      "question": "How does Disney's investment in its Experiences segment, which incurs infrastructure costs like technology support and utilities, compare to Meta's increase in infrastructure costs driven by employee compensation and data center expansion?",
      "answer": "Disney's Experiences segment incurs significant infrastructure costs such as technology support, utilities, and property taxes as part of its operations, which are essential to maintaining its theme parks and resorts. Meanwhile, Meta reported a notable increase in infrastructure costs in 2024, primarily driven by higher employee compensation and expenses related to data centers and technical infrastructure. While Disney's infrastructure costs are tied to physical locations and guest experiences, Meta's increases reflect its investment in digital infrastructure and workforce expansion, highlighting contrasting operational models between the two companies.",

While a number of different factors affect the demand for our products and services, actual or perceived economic conditions could contribute to lower attendance or spending at our parks and experiences businesses, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products and linear platforms, subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC platforms or licensing fees, while also continuing to increase the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Even if inflationary pressures moderate, we expect certain costs, such as for labor, to remain elevated. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and ex periences we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs, including borrowing costs as a result of elevated interest rates, making it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations and investments on favorable terms. A decline in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated could impact implementation or success of our business plans, such as our plans to increase investment in our Experiences segment, the realignment of our cost structure and plans for our DTC ad-supported services, enhancements, pricing structure and price increases. Unfavorable economic conditions also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. The adverse impact on our businesses of actual or perceived declines in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated will depend, in part, on their severity and duration and our ability to mitigate these impacts on our businesses is limited.\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses.\n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses, including by impacting the cost in U.S. dollars of providing our goods and services, our revenues in U.S. dollars generated by our international businesses and the international demand for our domestic products and services. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar adversely impacts the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and contributes to reduced international demand for our domestic products and services, including international travel to our domestic parks and resorts. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar often increases the cost of labor, goods and services in, or originating from, non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in certain countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries.\n\n## Changes in technology, in consumer consumption patterns and in how entertainment products are created affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products and the cost of producing or distributing these products.\n\nThe media entertainment and technology businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to new technologies including shifting patterns of content consumption and how entertainment products are generated. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. These developments have impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast and cable television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels. These developments have decreased advertising and affiliate revenue at some of our linear networks and have led, and may lead in the future, to the impairment of the value of certain of our assets. In addition, theater-going to watch movies has remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nRules governing new technological developments, such as developments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI and large language model tools, remain unsettled, and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model, including revenue streams for the use of our IP, how we create our entertainment products and the competition we face. In order to respond to the impact of new technologies on our businesses, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement new initiatives and changes to our business models, including by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, reorganizing our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies and developing new media offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, new media offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to technological changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution impacts the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. As part of our DTC strategy, we forgo certain revenue from certain traditional sources as we invest in our DTC offerings. Since launch, our DTC streaming services experienced significant losses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will each be or remain profitable or be as profitable over the long term as our historic business models.",

Operating expenses consist primarily of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed sports rights and production costs related to live sports and other sports-related programming.\n\n## Experiences\n\nThe Experiences segment primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant expenses include operating labor, infrastructure costs, costs of goods sold and distribution costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include technology support costs, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation. Other operating expenses include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings.\n\n## Eliminations\n\nThe following transactions are recognized in segment revenues and eliminated in total Company revenue:\n\n- Fees paid by Hulu to ESPN and the Entertainment linear networks business for the right to air their networks on Hulu Live\n- Fees paid by ABC Network and Disney+ to ESPN to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+, respectively\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS - 2024 vs. 2023\n\nThe following table presents revenues from our operating segments:\n\n",

      "answer": "Disney's goodwill impairment assessment for its entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units heavily relies on future revenue projections, operating margins, and terminal growth rates to estimate fair value. This forward-looking methodology contrasts with Meta's explicit caution that forward-looking statements \u2014 including projections of future results \u2014 are inherently uncertain and subject to risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially. Both companies operate under the financial industry's widely stated principle, as seen in JPMorgan's disclosures, that 'past performance is not indicative of future results,' which reinforces the limitations of projecting future financial outcomes based on current or historical data. Therefore, Disney's impairment model may be at odds with the standard disclaimer Meta prominently features, raising questions about the reliability of forward-looking fair value estimates in financial reporting.",

      "answer": "AT&T reported a 7.6% increase in its Latin America segment's operating revenues from 2023 to 2024, while Verizon's Consumer segment saw a 1.3% increase in operating revenues to $102.9 billion in 2024. This suggests that AT&T is experiencing stronger growth in international markets, particularly Latin America, whereas Verizon is maintaining steady growth in its domestic consumer market.

Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. under the V erizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE networks as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our V erizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.\n\nCustomers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. The Consumer segment also offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches.\n\nIn addition to wireless services and equipment for retail customers, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis.\n\nThe Consumer segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $102.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 1.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Consumer segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics.\n\n## Verizon Business G roup\n\nOur  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including  FWA   broadband,  data,  video  and  advanced communication services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world.\n\nThe Business segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $29.5 billion, a decrease of $591 million, or 2.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Business segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nCorporate and other primarily includes device insurance programs, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that support our  strategic  initiativ es,  as  well  as  unallocated  corporate  ex penses,  certain  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  related  costs  and  interest  and  financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated or used in assessing segment performance due to their nature. A lthough such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results and therefore are included in the chief operating decision maker's assessment of segment performance.

We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker's (CODM ) assessment of segment performance.\n\nThe Company's CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM  uses segment operating income to allocate resources (including employees, financial or capital resources) and to assess performance during the monthly and quarterly financial strategic review process. When assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources, the CODM  focuses on evaluating whether revenues generated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate return on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM  using segment operating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network technologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's priorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks, establishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions, branding matters and people management.\n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:",

In contrast, CMCSA's domestic revenue for 2021 was $21,243 million, which followed a decline from $16,646 million in 2019 to $16,211 million in 2020 before rebounding. This comparison suggests that while Disney Parks experienced steady domestic growth in 2022, likely driven by recovery in experiential entertainment post-pandemic, CMCSA's domestic segment showed more volatility, potentially reflecting broader challenges in the traditional cable and broadband markets. The relatively smaller scale but higher growth rate of Disney Parks' domestic revenue highlights its emerging strength in live experiences compared to CMCSA\u2019s more mature and consolidated domestic operations.",

      "question": "How does AT&T's concentration of 2023 operating income entirely within its Communications Segment contrast with Verizon's 2023 segment reporting approach, particularly regarding the reconciliation of segment to consolidated financials?",
      "answer": "AT&T's Communications Segment generated all of its 2023 segment operating income ($27.8 billion), showing complete financial reliance on this single segment. In contrast, Verizon explicitly disclosed a reconciliation process for its 2023 segment operating income to consolidated financials, noting adjustments for special items that the chief operating decision maker excludes when assessing segment performance. This contrast highlights differing levels of financial transparency and operational diversification between the two telecom giants.",

In contrast, GOOGL reports only $266 million in customer relationships but significantly higher investment in technology assets, with $4,639 million in patents and developed technology. This indicates that CMCSA places greater emphasis on customer relationships as a finite-lived asset, whereas GOOGL prioritizes technology-related intangibles, which has implications for amortization profiles and long-term competitive positioning in their respective industries.",

In contrast, DIS explicitly reported advertising revenue of $13,044 million in 2022.

For more information about our company's operations and the risks facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors, respectively. As discussed in Note 2, we changed the presentation of our segment operating results in 2021, and all amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Refer to Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, with the exception of the discussion and analysis related to our NBCUniversal segments, which is included below for all periods based on the updated segment structure.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications;  (2)  NBCUniversal  in  three  reportable  business  segments:  Media,  Studios  and  Theme  Parks  (collectively,  the 'NBCUniversal segments'); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment.\n\n## 2021 Developments\n\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2021:\n\n## Cable Communications\n\n- Revenue increased 7.1% to $64.3 billion, reflecting increases in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video and other revenue, partially offset by a decline in voice revenue.\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2% to $28.1 billion primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by increases in programming and technical and product support expenses.\n- Operating margin increased from 42.1% to 43.7%.",

      "answer": "In 2021, NBCUniversal Studios generated 42% of its content licensing revenue from intersegment transactions, primarily with the Media segment, influenced by the Peacock-exclusive licensing strategy introduced in Q1 2021. This internal licensing model is similar to Disney\u2019s Studios segment, which creates content under banners like Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel, and Pixar that is then used across its broader media ecosystem, including Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer platforms. Both companies rely on internal content licensing to drive value across their respective segments, with NBCUniversal deferring profit recognition in eliminations until the content is used over the license period, mirroring Disney's integrated content lifecycle.",

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to  provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period.\n\nA summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.\n\n",

Meanwhile, VZ's Consumer segment was a primary growth driver for consolidated operating revenues, though VZ allocates centrally managed network and shared service costs to this segment based on proportionate usage.

In contrast, Comcast does not include distribution costs associated with film and television content in its capitalized costs, instead expensing them as incurred, which likely results in higher upfront operating expenses and a more immediate impact on operating margins.

Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the flat trend in NFLX's Technology and Development Expenses in 2023 compare with CMCSA's capitalized payroll cost increases tied to internal-use software development, given that both companies report payroll as a core component of technology-related spending?",
      "answer": "NFLX reported that its Technology and Development Expenses remained relatively flat in 2023, which include payroll and stock-based compensation for technology personnel. These expenses are a direct component of their cost structure and are expensed as incurred. In contrast, CMCSA capitalizes direct payroll costs associated with internal-use software development and amortizes them over up to five years. CMCSA's approach suggests that increases in payroll costs for software projects are not immediately expensed but are instead spread over time, which could lead to a different financial impact compared to NFLX\u2019s direct expense model. This distinction in accounting treatment highlights how the same underlying cost\u2014payroll for technology development\u2014can influence financial reporting differently across companies.",

For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, including the CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Other U.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing additional rights for users and could result in restrictions  on  our  use  of  signals  from  third-party  apps  and  websites  through  certain  browser-  and  device-based  universal  opt-out  mechanisms.  Judicial  and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings.\n\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and G oogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\n\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021.  If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\n\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\n\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to",

      "answer": "META's platform has implemented changes to its Feed algorithms and ad prominence, which may reduce user engagement with ads and consequently weaken the effectiveness of digital advertising strategies used by companies like DIS. Since DIS's Linear Networks generate revenue from both affiliate fees and advertising, a decline in advertising effectiveness could disproportionately impact the segment's revenue growth or stability. Additionally, if advertisers shift budgets away from digital platforms due to reduced reach, DIS may face challenges in maintaining ad revenue for its Linear Networks, which already operate in a competitive and evolving media landscape.",

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe also earn revenues that are not accounted for under T opic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest recognized when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized agent under a device payment plan agreement.\n\n## Nature of Products and Services\n\n## Telecommunications\n\n## Service\n\nWe offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. M onthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability . See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).\n\nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability , and serv ice rev enue is recogniz ed ov er the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.\n\n## Equipment\n\nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the V erizon brand and other brands.  Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we  have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans (for our Business customers) and device payment plans.\n\nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically  for a term of 36 months or less).\n\nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, ty pically  ov er a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.\n\nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitativ e and quantitativ e considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fix ed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately . See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel.\n\n## Wireless Contracts\n\nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures.\n\nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The total",

We also developed an expectation of aggregate domestic residential revenue from subscribers based on cash received during the year.  We compared those estimates to revenue recognized by the Company.\n\n## Goodwill - Refer to Note 9 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe  Company's  evaluation  of  goodwill  for  impairment  is  performed  at  the  reporting  unit  level.  To  determine  its  reporting  units,  the  Company  evaluates  the components one level below the segment level and aggregates the components if they have similar economic characteristics. The Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Media reporting unit, which involved a comparison of the fair value of the Media reporting unit to its carrying value.\n\nThe Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant judgments related to discount rates and forecasts of expected cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $58 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $20 billion was allocated to the Media reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of the Media reporting unit ex ceeded its carrying value and no impairment was recognized.\n\nWe identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the Media reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate  the  fair  value  of  the  Media  reporting  unit.  This  required  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  and  an  increased  ex tent  of  effort,  when  performing  audit procedures to evaluate management's conclusion related to the aggregation of components into a single reporting unit and the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate, revenue growth rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin included in future expected cash flows for the Media reporting unit.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures to evaluate the determination of the reporting unit as well as the discount rate, revenue growth rate and Adjusted EBITDA margin included in future expected cash flows used by management to estimate the fair value of the Media reporting unit included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over (a) the accounting policies regarding identification of the unit of account for goodwill and (b) the determination of the fair value of Media, such as controls related to management's selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future expected cash flows.\n- With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n- We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results in the respective years.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "CMCSA's NBCUniversal Theme Parks segment saw a dramatic recovery in 2021, with Adjusted EBITDA improving from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, driven by the easing of capacity restrictions and the opening of Universal Beijing Resort. This rebound contributed positively to NBCUniversal's total Adjusted EBITDA of $5.7 billion, despite a 18% decline in the Media segment due to Olympic broadcasting costs. In contrast, DIS focused on scaling original content production\u2014planning over 270 original programs for fiscal 2023\u2014to strengthen its DTC platforms, reflecting a content-driven growth strategy versus CMCSA's operational recovery in physical entertainment venues.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Excluding $1.8 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, revenue in the Media segment increased 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n- Media segment results include the operations of Peacock, which in 2021 generated revenue of $778 million and operating costs and expenses of $2.5 billion, compared to revenue of $118 million and operating costs and expenses of $781 million in 2020. We continued to invest in content and grow our customer base during 2021, and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced certain ad-supported Peacock programming into Sky video services, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n- Studios segment revenue increased 16.2% to $9.4 billion, due to increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue and  home  entertainment  and  other  revenue  as  our  film  and  television  production  operations  returned  to  full  capacity. Studios revenue included licenses of content to our Media and other segments, including the impact of a new licensing agreement  for  content  that  became  exclusively  available  for  streaming  on  Peacock  in  2021,  and  the  impacts  of  initial content licenses associated with the launch of Peacock in 2020, which are eliminated in consolidation.\n- Theme Parks segment revenue increased 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, reflecting the operation of our theme parks in the current year period compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period and the opening of our theme park in Beijing, China in September 2021.\n- Revenue increased 9.1% to $20.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky revenue increased 3.1% due to increases  in  advertising  and  direct-to-consumer  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  content  revenue,  which  were affected by COVID-19 in the prior year period and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in the current year period.\n- Adjusted  EBITDA increased  20.8%  to  $2.4  billion.  Excluding  the  impact  of  foreign  currency,  Sky Adjusted  EBITDA increased 10.2% primarily due to increases in revenue and decreases in programming and production expenses, partially offset by increases in direct network costs and other expenses.\n\n## Other\n\n- Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA losses decreased from $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year period in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses.\n- Resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021. We repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion in 2021. Raised our dividend by $0.08 to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis in January 2021 and paid $4.5 billion of dividends in 2021.\n- Reduced debt by $8.9 billion in 2021 and ended the year with $94.8 billion of total short-term and long-term debt and $8.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Impacts of COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways, with the most significant effects in 2020, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such\n\n## Sky",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\n\nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery engine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn, get things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.\n\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.\n\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery engine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure capacity.\n\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts. This includes developing virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many products may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the next computing platform will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the nex t computing platform is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.",

These charges were explicitly disclosed as part of the 'Certain significant items' category within Corporate and Other. In contrast, Comcast's 2022 10-K shows a $0 balance in its Corporate and Other segment at year-end, suggesting a different approach to handling such charges\u2014either through absorption into other segments or more aggressive cost consolidation.

      "answer": "Google does not allocate certain AI-focused R&D costs, including development costs of general AI models, to its segments \u2014 these are instead treated as Alphabet-level activities. In contrast, AT&T's Communications Segment, which contributed 97% of total segment operating revenues and nearly all segment operating income in 2024, reported an operating income margin of 23.0%. This comparison reveals that while AT&T directly ties a high-margin performance metric to its core communications business, Google keeps significant AI-related costs outside segment reporting, potentially affecting intercompany comparability and performance assessment.",

      "answer": "Disney reported a 20% year-over-year growth in its Direct-to-Consumer revenue, reaching $19,558 million in 2022. This growth aligns with broader industry trends in streaming, which also impacted Comcast\u2019s Sky segment. According to Comcast\u2019s 2022 filing, the Sky segment experienced growth driven by increased advertising and direct-to-consumer revenue, despite declines in content revenue and foreign currency effects. However, Comcast\u2019s financial exposure to the Sky segment is relatively small, as evidenced by its intersegment revenue contribution of only $32 million in 2021, suggesting a limited strategic focus or dependency on Sky\u2019s performance relative to Disney\u2019s aggressive investment in its DTC platform.",

        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 Direct-to-Consumer Revenue: Disney's DTC revenue grew by 20% in 2022, reaching $19.56 billion, showing a significant investment in streaming platforms.",
        "Hop 2: Direct-to-Consumer Revenue \u2192 Sky Segment: The Sky segment at Comcast saw growth fueled in part by direct-to-consumer revenue, indicating a parallel investment strategy in streaming services.",
        "Hop 3: Sky Segment \u2190 CMCSA: Despite this, Comcast's intersegment revenue contribution from Sky was only $32 million in 2021, suggesting a minimal financial stake and strategic emphasis compared to Disney\u2019s DTC focus."

      "answer": "CMCSA capitalizes $67.9 billion in total future content commitments (including $64.6 billion for sports rights and $3.3 billion for licensed content), with amortization based on estimates of ultimate revenue derived from past performance. However, as noted in the JPM_10k_2023 document, past performance is not always indicative of future results, introducing uncertainty into revenue projections tied to historical data. META, in contrast, bases its forward-looking statements about future results on current expectations and projections, which may not account for the same content amortization risks faced by CMCSA. Therefore, if CMCSA's capitalized content underperforms relative to past trends, it could indirectly undermine the financial stability or forecasting accuracy of entities like META that operate in overlapping media ecosystems, making their forward guidance less reliable.",

      "answer": "DIS's advertising revenue grew from $12.43 billion in 2021 to $13.04 billion in 2022, representing a 4.9% increase. In contrast, CMCSA's Cable Communications segment advertising revenue was part of its broader $64.3 billion revenue in 2021, which included growth in advertising as a component of a 7.1% overall revenue increase. While DIS shows steady growth in advertising as a standalone metric, CMCSA highlights advertising as a contributing factor to a more diversified revenue base that also includes broadband, wireless, and business services. This suggests that for DIS, advertising is a growing but smaller part of the overall business, while for CMCSA, advertising plays a supporting role within a more diversified segment strategy.",

For more information about our company's operations and the risks facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors, respectively. As discussed in Note 2, we changed the presentation of our segment operating results in 2021, and all amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Refer to Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, with the exception of the discussion and analysis related to our NBCUniversal segments, which is included below for all periods based on the updated segment structure.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications;  (2)  NBCUniversal  in  three  reportable  business  segments:  Media,  Studios  and  Theme  Parks  (collectively,  the 'NBCUniversal segments'); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment.\n\n## 2021 Developments\n\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2021:\n\n## Cable Communications\n\n- Revenue increased 7.1% to $64.3 billion, reflecting increases in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video and other revenue, partially offset by a decline in voice revenue.\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2% to $28.1 billion primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by increases in programming and technical and product support expenses.\n- Operating margin increased from 42.1% to 43.7%.",

      "answer": "Disney's Experiences segment saw a $1,602 million increase in revenue, representing 5% year-over-year growth, indicating strong performance in this area. Meanwhile, AT&T reported that the 'Trademarks, Trade Names and Other' intangible asset category had a gross carrying amount of $289 million in 2023, with a currency translation adjustment of -$5 million. This small negative adjustment suggests minimal impact from foreign exchange fluctuations on these assets. Comparing the two, Disney's Experiences growth highlights revenue momentum tied to physical and brand experiences, while AT&T's Trademarks and Trade Names show relative stability in asset value despite currency pressures, which could reflect different asset management or geographic exposure strategies.",

      "answer": "AT&T's Mobility segment reported operating revenues of $85,255 million in 2024, reflecting a 1.5% increase from 2023. In comparison, Verizon reported total operating revenues of $134,578 million in 2024, with $73,139 million from Consumer services and $31,072 million from Business segments. This suggests that while AT&T's Mobility segment is growing modestly, Verizon maintains a broader revenue base across both consumer and business markets, indicating a more diversified performance in the telecommunications sector.",

In contrast, Verizon organizes its operations into two broader reportable segments\u2014Consumer and Business\u2014and uses segment operating income as the key metric for resource allocation, including decisions on network technology upgrades, capital expenditures, and geographic expansion.

The CODM  uses segment operating income to allocate resources (including employees, financial or capital resources) and to assess performance during the monthly and quarterly financial strategic review process. When assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources, the CODM  focuses on evaluating whether revenues generated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate return on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM  using segment operating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network technologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's priorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks, establishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions, branding matters and people management.\n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:",

However, Disney notes that shifting viewer habits and digital competition are affecting advertising yields. In contrast, Meta's advertising revenue is highly dependent on user engagement with its platforms, particularly in the Feed product. Meta highlights that product changes aimed at improving user experience\u2014such as algorithm updates or ad prominence adjustments\u2014have at times reduced engagement, which could adversely affect ad monetization. Additionally, Meta's push into Reels, which monetizes at a lower rate than Feed, presents a structural challenge to overall advertising yield. While Disney's challenge centers on adapting legacy sports media ad models to a fragmented digital landscape, Meta's challenge is more around balancing user engagement with ad load and monetization strategy across evolving product formats.",

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

      "answer": "Disney projects its postretirement medical obligations from 2025 to 2034, totaling $335 million for 2030\u20132034 alone, which reflects a growing long-term liability. This liability is influenced by actuarial losses, as seen in 2023 where Disney reported a $190 million net actuarial loss for postretirement medical plans. For Verizon, the 2023 net actuarial loss included a $534 million impact from postretirement benefit plans, driven by an increase in the healthcare cost trend assumption to 7.3%. Thus, both companies face growing liabilities tied to postretirement medical plans, with Disney showing multi-year commitments and Verizon experiencing a significant near-term increase due to rising healthcare cost assumptions.",

      "answer": "AT&T's $6.97 billion in advertising revenue highlights a significant reliance on advertising as a standalone revenue stream, particularly within its broader portfolio of services. In contrast, advertising is a growth driver for Comcast's Sky segment, but Sky's $32 million intersegment revenue contribution to Comcast in 2022 indicates limited integration or direct financial dependency between Sky and Comcast's core operations. This suggests that while advertising plays a pivotal role in AT&T's revenue generation, its influence within Comcast's ecosystem is more constrained, operating largely independently from Sky's advertising-driven growth and other Comcast segments.",

In contrast, NFLX reports its buildings and improvements have a 30-year useful life. According to industry standards, such as those referenced by GILD, buildings and improvements are typically depreciated over the shorter of 35 years or their useful life, suggesting that NFLX\u2019s 30-year estimate aligns with common practice. This highlights a significant difference in asset depreciation timelines between META\u2019s server infrastructure and NFLX\u2019s physical real estate assets.",

These uncertain tax positions include our estimates related to uncertainties with our research and development tax credits that are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Similarly, our estimates for transfer pricing have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for income tax es. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax  outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income tax es in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Valuation of Assets\n\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment and assumptions such as estimation of future cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and companies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\n\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, occurs whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable compared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\n\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative is performed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity securities, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is  similar  to  the  non-marketable  equity  security  we  hold  may  require  judgment  in  (a)  assessment  of  differences  in  rights  and  obligations  associated  with  the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. The identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.\n\n## Change in Accounting Estimate\n\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full-year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion. For information regarding the change in useful lives of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

Since amortization of capitalized production costs is allocated across the Entertainment segment's businesses based on estimated relative value of distribution windows, a lower amortization amount might suggest less content is being amortized, or that distribution strategies are evolving.

In contrast, Disney includes participations and residual expenses as a significant component within its broader 'programming and production costs' category, which also includes amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees, live programming costs, and fees paid to the Sports segment. While Disney does not disclose a specific dollar amount for participations and residual expenses alone, it explicitly lists them as a core component of Entertainment segment operating expenses, indicating a comparable strategic importance in content monetization strategies between the two companies.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

Programming and production costs include the following:\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs\n- Amortization of the costs of licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n- Selling, general and administrative costs, including marketing costs\n- Depreciation and amortization\n\n## Linear Networks\n\nThe majority of Linear Networks revenue is derived from affiliate fees and advertising. The Company's Linear Networks businesses provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with MVPDs and/or affiliated television stations that are generally based on contractually specified rates on a per subscriber basis. The amounts that we can charge for our networks are largely dependent on the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide and the competitive market for programming services. The ability to sell advertising time and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand.\n\n## Domestic Linear Networks\n\n## ABC Network\n\nABC Network programming is aired in the primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports 'dayparts'. Primetime programming includes scripted series, reality programming and a variety of movies and specials. ESPN programs the sports daypart on ABC Network, which is branded ESPN on ABC. ABC Network distributes programming to approximately 245 local affiliated television stations and to our eight owned television stations, which collectively reach almost 100% of U.S. television households.\n\nABC Network produces a variety of unscripted series, primetime specials, news and daytime programming.\n\n## Disney Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: Disney Channel; Disney Junior; and Disney XD (collectively Disney Channels). Disney Channels air programming 24 hours a day targeted to kids ages 2 to 14 and generally feature live-action comedy series, animated programming and preschool series as well as original movies and theatrical films.\n\n## Freeform\n\nFreeform is a channel targeted to viewers ages 18 to 34 that airs original and licensed television series, films and holiday programming events.\n\n## FX Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: FX; FXM; and FXX (collectively FX Channels), which air a mix of original and licensed television series and films.\n\n## National Geographic Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: National Geographic; Nat Geo Wild; and Nat Geo Mundo (collectively National Geographic Channels). National Geographic Channels air programming in genres such as travel, adventure, wildlife, documentary, science and history.",

This highlights the importance of distribution agreements in generating Media revenue.

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. As a result, our portfolio of programming rights and the distributors of our programming have changed and may continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, have demanded and may continue to demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution, the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms and the impacts of COVID-19. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. There can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.\n\n## Changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.\n\nOur broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of U.S. and overseas regulations. Some of these regulations include:\n\n- U.S. FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See Item 1 - Business - Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, Federal Regulation.\n- Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations.\n- Regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations, including potential regulation regarding the sourcing, importation and the sale of goods.\n- Environmental protection regulations.\n- U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, sanction programs and trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or film or television content requirements, investment obligations or quotas.\n- Domestic and international labor laws, tax laws or currency controls.\n\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes in any of these current laws and regulations or regulator activities in any of these areas, or others, may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable, and create an increasingly unpredictable regulatory landscape. For example, in 2019 India implemented regulation and tariffs impacting certain bundling of channels; in 2022 the U.S. and other countries implemented a series of sanctions against Russia in response to events in Russia and Ukraine; U.S. agencies have enhanced trade restrictions and legislation is currently under consideration that would prohibit importation of goods from certain regions; U.S. state governments have become more active in passing legislation targeted at specific sectors and companies; and in many countries/regions around the world (including but not limited to the EU) regulators are requiring us to broadcast on our linear (or display on our DTC streaming services) programming produced in specific countries as well as invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content productions.\n\nPublic health and other regional, national, state and local regulations and policies are impacting our ability to operate our businesses at all or in accordance with historic practice. In addition to the government requirements that have impacted most of our businesses as a result of COVID-19, government requirements may continue to be extended and new government requirements may be imposed to address COVID-19 or future health outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n## Our operations outside the U.S. may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.\n\nOur operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than, or in addition to, U.S. law. Our risks of operating internationally have increased following the completion of the TFCF acquisition, which increased the importance of international operations to our future operations, growth and prospects. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S. These differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under U.S. law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some international jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete",

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to  provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period.\n\nA summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.\n\n",

In contrast, Verizon explicitly uses industry EBITDA margin results and projections as part of its qualitative assessment for wireless license impairment, indicating that weaker EBITDA trends in the broader telecom sector could trigger impairment charges. This comparison shows that while AT&T is generating stronger EBITDA growth, which may enable proactive infrastructure reinvestment, Verizon is monitoring EBITDA trends across the industry to evaluate the long-term viability and valuation of its wireless licenses, which are treated as indefinite-lived assets.",

While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten to fifteen years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. M oreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. A s a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network.\n\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitativ e  assessment  to  determine  whether  it  is  necessary  to  perform  a  quantitative  impairment  test.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.\n\nAs part of our qualitative assessment we consider several factors including the enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA  margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitativ e assessment. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests.\n\nOur quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A  discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized.\n\nInterest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.\n\nWireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets\n\nOur intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful liv es. A ll of our intangible assets subject to amortiz ation and other long-liv ed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment, if any . We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.\n\nSee Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately , we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use.\n\nFor both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability , which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn addition, in both our Consumer and our Business segments, we expect to support connection growth in part by adding capacity and further expanding our wireless coverage, and by continuing the build-out and densification of our 5G network.\n\n## Service Revenue Trends\n\nIn our Consumer segment, we expect continued growth in our wireless service revenue, driven by targeted pricing actions, migrations to higher priced plans, increased offering of perks, and increases in FWA  connections and revenue, offset in part by higher promotion amortization impacts in 2025. Our efforts to maintain and grow our customer base and make improvements to our prepaid business, if successful, are also expected to benefit our wireless service revenue. We expect Fios revenue to benefit from growth in our Fios customer base and an ongoing demand for higher speed internet connections, which offsets the impact of the shift from bundled wireline services to standalone internet service.\n\nIn our Business segment, we expect wireless service revenue to expand, driven by growth from an increase in wireless volumes and strong FWA  revenue. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth and that legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures.\n\n## Other Trends\n\nWe are focused on achieving profitable growth as we continue to deliver strong revenues and undertake initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including through A I-driven technologies.\n\nWe expect that our ability to generate cash flows will benefit from our expected service revenue growth, despite the moderate expected increase in our 2025 capital program compared to 2024. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information on our capital program.\n\nIn the course of business, we make promotional equipment offers to attract and retain customers. In 2024, the growth of our wireless service revenue was unfavorably impacted by the amortization of wireless equipment sales and promotions. We expect these pressures to continue and increase in 2025. In addition, in 2023 and 2024, we had fewer phone upgrades compared to prior years. T o the extent upgrade volumes increase in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe use the net cash generated from our operations to invest in new businesses and spectrum, fund expansion and modernization of our networks, pay dividends, service and repay external financing and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary , from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance is $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally , and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity . See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout M arket Risk\" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.\n\nWe expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, including, for example, to complete our acquisition of Frontier, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our ex ternal financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nOur 2025 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding and adding capacity and density to our core networks, the ongoing deployment of C-Band spectrum, and advancing our network architecture. It will also support our broadband expansion plans including the launch of our fixed wireless access solution for multi-dwelling units. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2025 capital program to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion.\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nWe have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n\n- Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $142.2 billion, of which $21.7 billion (including $3.3 billion of unsecured debt) are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Related interest payments are $66.3 billion, of which $5.8 billion, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.",

Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated or used in assessing segment performance due to their nature. A lthough such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results and therefore are included in the chief operating decision maker's assessment of segment performance.

      "question": "How does the impact of tax incentives on content amortization differ between NFLX and DIS, given their respective amortization strategies and incentive structures?",
      "answer": "NFLX amortizes content based on estimated viewing patterns and received $899 million in tax incentives in 2024, which reduced the cost basis of content assets and thus lowered amortization expenses over time. In contrast, DIS amortizes produced and licensed content on a straight-line basis over 20 years and recognizes tax incentives as a reduction to content costs when collection is assured, which then lowers programming and production costs over the amortization period. While both companies benefit from tax incentives that reduce amortization, NFLX's amortization is more sensitive to consumption-based estimates, whereas DIS applies a more standardized straight-line method with incentives directly offsetting costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NFLX \u2192 Content Amortization: NFLX amortizes content based on estimated viewing patterns, which is subjective and influenced by forecasted consumption, impacting financial results if estimates vary.",
        "Hop 2: Content Amortization \u2192 Tax Incentives: Tax incentives received by NFLX (e.g., $899 million in 2024) reduce the cost basis of content, thereby lowering amortization expenses over the life of the content.",
        "Hop 3: Tax Incentives \u2190 DIS: DIS also benefits from tax incentives, which are recognized as a reduction to content costs when collection is assured, and these incentives lower programming costs over the straight-line amortization period for acquired and produced content."

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, ex cept it ex cludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title's unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the ex tent the title's unamortized costs ex ceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\n\n## Content Production Incentives\n\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as 'Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset's amortization period.\n\n## Internal-Use Software Costs\n\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.\n\n## Parks, Resorts and Other Property\n\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

      "answer": "Disney reported a segment operating income of $12,863 million in 2023, indicating a substantial profit base for strategic allocation. AT&T's Consumer Wireline segment, by contrast, had a much smaller operating income of $651 million in the same year. AT&T assesses impairment risk for this segment using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches, which suggests a forward-looking, valuation-based framework for capital decisions. Given Disney\u2019s significantly higher segment operating income, its capital allocation likely prioritizes content investment and global expansion, whereas AT&T\u2019s reliance on cash flow and market-based valuations for impairment may lead to more cautious reinvestment or divestiture considerations for Consumer Wireline, particularly if future cash flow projections weaken.",

      "answer": "In 2023, META allocated $70.13 billion to its Family of Apps segment, which focuses on developing platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, as well as advertising services and technical infrastructure. This reflects a heavy investment in digital engagement and monetization through ads. In contrast, CMCSA reported total costs and expenses of $46.275 billion, with $18.5 billion allocated to programming and $27.775 billion to other expenses, including infrastructure and operational costs. While META's spending emphasizes digital platform development and AI integration for ad-driven revenue, CMCSA's cost structure reflects a more traditional media and connectivity model, with significant outlays on content licensing and physical network infrastructure.",

      "answer": "Google's cost of revenues increased by 10% year-over-year, driven by higher content acquisition costs, TAC, and depreciation expense, which are core components of its cost structure. This reflects the direct relationship between cost of revenues and overall cost structure, which also includes operating expenses like R&D and employee compensation.

( 2)\n\n- Revenues were $350.0 billion, an increase of 14% year ov er year, primarily driv en by an increase in Google Serv ices rev enues of $32.4 billion, or 12%, and an increase in Google Cloud rev enues of $10.1 billion, or 31%.\n- Total constant currency rev enues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 15% year ov er year.\n- Cost of rev enues was $146.3 billion, an increase of 10% year ov er year, primarily driv en by increases in content acquisition costs, TAC, and depreciation expense.\n- Operating  expenses  were  $91.3  billion,  an  increase  of  2%  year  ov er  year,  primarily  driv en  by  increases  in  depreciation  expense, employee compensation expenses, and third-party serv ices fees. These increases were partially offset by reductions in charges related to legal and other matters and charges related to our office space optimization efforts.  The ov erall increase in employee compensation expenses was partially offset by a reduction in employee sev erance and related charges.\n\n## Other Information:\n\n- Div idend payments to stockholders of Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion, respectiv ely, totaling $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. For additional information, see Note 1 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n- Repurchases  of  Class  A  and  Class  C  shares  were  $1 1.9  billion  and  $50.2  billion,  respectiv ely,  totaling  $62.0  billion  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2024. For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n- Employee severance and related charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $1.0 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Office space charges, including accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation, for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $796 million, a decrease of $1.3 billion as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Substantially all of these charges were included in Alphabet-lev el activ ities.\n- Operating cash flow was $125.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n- Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected inv estments in technical infrastructure, were $52.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n- As of December 31, 2024, we had 183,323 employees.",

T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nFluctuations in our  Google  Cloud rev enues hav e been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of rev enues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and  marketing,  and  general  and  administrativ e  functions.  Certain  of  our  costs  and  expenses,  including  those  associated  with  the  operation  of  our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues primarily includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n- employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content rev iew and customer and product support;\n- inv entory and other costs related to the dev ices we sell; and\n- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\n\nTAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the adv ertiser rev enues from ads serv ed on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in  the  United  States,  in  Europe  or  globally  could  adversely  affect  demand  for  any  of  our  products  and  services  and  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks.  In  particular,  the  success  of  our  theme  parks  and  theatrical  releases  largely  depends  on  consumer  demand  for  out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also cause governments and regulators to impose additional tax or product affordability regulations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as high interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\n## Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  make  acquisitions  and  investments  and  may  pursue  other  strategic  initiatives,  such  as  the  proposed  Spin-off.  In  connection  with  such acquisitions  and  strategic  initiatives,  we  may  incur  significant  or  unanticipated  ex penses,  fail  to  realize  anticipated  benefits  and  synergies,  have  difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "Netflix's Total Contributions decreased from $224,170 thousand in 2022 to $142,442 thousand in 2023, a drop of $81,728 thousand. AT&T, on the other hand, spent $570 thousand in 2023 to match employee contributions under its savings plans. This suggests that while Netflix significantly reduced its total benefit contributions year-over-year, AT&T maintained a relatively stable level of investment in employee savings, indicating potentially different approaches to employee benefit cost management.",

      "answer": "CMCSA explicitly does not capitalize distribution-related marketing costs, meaning these expenses are recognized immediately on the income statement, potentially reducing short-term profitability but providing a more conservative financial presentation. This contrasts with Disney's SG&A cost trends: they reported a $406 million increase in SG&A costs for their Direct-to-Consumer segment, driven by higher marketing and labor expenses, while simultaneously achieving a $487 million decrease in SG&A for Content Sales/Licensing, primarily due to lower theatrical marketing costs. This suggests Disney is managing SG&A costs differently across segments, reducing expenses in traditional areas while investing in newer direct-to-consumer growth areas.

      "answer": "Comcast's advertising sales revenue is directly impacted by challenges in measuring fragmented audiences due to the rise of DTC streaming and digital platforms, which affects advertiser confidence. This is compounded by declining audience ratings linked to increased competition for viewer attention. Similarly, Disney's Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales, and pay-per-view, and is exposed to the same evolving viewing habits. The flexibility in Disney's content distribution strategy allows for shifting content between platforms, but also means that changes in consumer behavior\u2014like those accelerated by the pandemic\u2014can significantly affect both cost allocation and revenue timing. Therefore, both companies are vulnerable to shifts in consumer preferences, but Disney's diversified monetization model in its DTC segment offers a different risk profile compared to Comcast's more traditional advertising exposure.",

The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations, channels, or digital platforms. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, online media and other digital sources. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur television and streaming platforms compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other cable, broadcast and premium networks, DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, and local broadcast television stations. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost is significant.\n\nOur  cable  networks  compete  with  other  cable  networks  and  programming  providers  for  carriage  of  their  programming  by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. Our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences for our film and television content with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position  of  our  film  and  television  studios  primarily  depends  on  the  number  of  films  and  shows  and  episodes  produced,  their distribution  and  marketing  success,  and  consumer  response.  Our  film  and  television  studios  also  compete  to  obtain  creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on premium networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nTheme Parks competes with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and  recreational  activities.  To  help  maintain  the  competitiveness  of  our  theme  parks,  we  have  invested  and  continue  to  invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including the new theme parks in Beijing and Orlando.\n\n## Sky Segment\n\nSky is one of Europe's leading entertainment companies operating in six territories, including three of the largest pay television markets in Western Europe: the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. The majority of our revenue is derived from our direct-toconsumer business, which has 23.0 million customer relationships, and primarily involves the distribution of a wide array of video channels  to  both  residential  and  business  customers.  We  also  offer  broadband,  voice  and  wireless  services  individually  and  as bundled services in select countries. We own a diverse portfolio of pay television channels that feature entertainment, news, sports and movies, which are included in our subscription video services and are also licensed through various distribution partnerships to third-party video providers to reach an additional 3 million households. We also generate revenue from the licensing of owned and licensed programming to third-party video providers and from the sale of advertising.\n\n## Direct-to-Consumer\n\n## Video\n\nOur  direct-to-home  ('DTH')  video  services  are  delivered  primarily  through  a  combination  of  both  satellite  transmission  and broadband connections that are marketed under the Sky brand in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Austria.

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

      "answer": "In 2023, Meta allocated 80% of its $88.15 billion total costs and expenses ($70.13 billion) to the Family of Apps segment, reflecting a heavy investment in its core social media and advertising platform. Meanwhile, Comcast (CMCSA) reported total costs and expenses of $46.275 billion against total revenue of $72.386 billion in the same period, resulting in a cost-to-revenue ratio of approximately 64%.

This segment incurs costs including amortization of licensed programming rights, which are allocated across its businesses. Meanwhile, DIS reported spending $13,405 million on licensed programming rights in 2023, with a notable portion of their content being monetized either individually or as a group. This indicates DIS places a strong emphasis on licensing as part of its broader content strategy, while CMCSA integrates licensed content within a diversified entertainment business model.",

      "answer": "Disney's domestic revenue from its Parks, Experiences and Products segment grew to $2,680 million in 2022 from $1,597 million in 2021, representing a 67.8% increase. Meanwhile, Comcast's most recent domestic revenue figure in the provided data is $21,243 million for 2021. While Disney's segment-level domestic revenue is significantly smaller than Comcast's total domestic revenue, the substantial year-over-year growth in Disney's parks segment suggests a strong recovery in consumer discretionary spending on experiences, potentially indicating a shift in consumer preference or market share dynamics within the domestic entertainment sector.",

      "answer": "T experienced a decrease in marketing costs in 2023, which contributed to a broader decline in operations and support expenses, where declines were also driven by automation, digitization, and lower personnel and network access costs. This contrasts with Disney\u2019s 2023 results, where marketing costs increased by $406 million, directly contributing to a rise in SG&A costs to $4,574 million. However, Disney later saw a decrease in SG&A costs to $2,108 million, driven by lower theatrical marketing costs due to fewer major releases. Thus, while T\u2019s cost-cutting in marketing supported expense improvements, Disney faced rising SG&A due to increased marketing spend, highlighting divergent cost strategies in different industries.",

In 2022, retained costs from the Video business separation in 2021 were also reported in Corporate, impacting the reconciliation process. Meanwhile, Comcast's Corporate and Other segment showed a negligible balance of $2 million in 2020 and $0 million in 2021, indicating minimal corporate-level acquisition-related adjustments during the same period, suggesting a contrasting approach or scale of integration and divestiture activity.",

          "chunk_text": "- In November 2021, we sold our Vrio business unit, which provided video services primarily to residential customers using satellite technology in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n## General\n\nWe are a leading provider of telecommunications, media and technology services globally. The services and products that we offer vary by market and utilize various technology platforms in a range of geographies. Our reportable segments are organized as follows:\n\nThe Communications segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:\n\n- Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment.\n- Business Wireline provides advanced IP-based services, as well as traditional voice and data services to business customers.\n- Consumer Wireline provides internet, including broadband fiber, and legacy telephony voice communication services to residential customers.\n\nThe WarnerMedia segment develops, produces and distributes feature films, television, gaming and other content in various physical and digital formats globally. WarnerMedia content is distributed through basic networks, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) or theatrical, TV content and games licensing. Segment results also include Xandr advertising and Otter Media Holdings (Otter Media). We disposed of substantially all Otter Media assets in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery). On December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft). (See Note 6)\n\nThe Latin America segment provides wireless services and equipment in Mexico, and prior to the November 2021 disposition of Vrio, video services in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nCorporate and Other reconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes, and includes:\n\n- Corporate , which consists of: (1) businesses no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, (2) corporate support functions, (3) impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, and (4) the reclassification of the amortization of prior service credits, which we continue to report with segment operating expenses, to consolidated 'Other income (expense) - net.' Costs previously allocated to the Video business that were retained after the transaction, net of reimbursements from DIRECTV under transition service agreements, are reported in Corporate following the transaction through 2022, to maintain comparability of our operating segment results, and while operational plans and continued cost reduction initiatives are implemented.\n- Video , which consists of our former U.S. video operations that were contributed to DIRECTV on July 31, 2021 and also includes our share of DIRECTV's earnings as equity in net income of affiliates (see Note 10).\n- Acquisition-related items , which consists of items associated with the merger and integration of acquired or divested businesses, including amortization of intangible assets.\n- Certain significant items , which includes (1) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, (2) asset impairments and abandonments, and (3) other items for which the segments are not being evaluated.\n- Eliminations and consolidations , which (1) removes transactions involving dealings between our segments, including channel distribution between WarnerMedia and Video prior to its separation, and (2) includes adjustments for our reporting of the advertising business.",

      "question": "Given NBCUniversal's reliance on advertising sales for revenue, its $1.6 billion debt load as of 2022, and Disney's explicit risk factor highlighting market volatility in advertising sales on direct-to-consumer platforms, how might fluctuations in advertising demand affect NBCUniversal's financial stability and competitive positioning relative to DIS?",
      "answer": "NBCUniversal, a segment of CMCSA, generated significant revenue from advertising sales as noted in its 2022 disclosures, with advertising prices influenced by audience demographics and ratings. As of 2022, NBCUniversal carried $1.6 billion in debt, indicating a material financial obligation. Meanwhile, DIS flagged volatility in advertising demand on direct-to-consumer platforms as a material risk factor, suggesting that advertisers are shifting preferences and that the market for traditional TV advertising may be under pressure. If advertising sales continue to fragment across streaming platforms, NBCUniversal\u2019s ability to maintain pricing power and service its $1.6 billion in debt could be challenged, potentially weakening its competitive stance against DIS, which is actively navigating and disclosing risks around this market shift.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMany of these competitors also have significant financial resources.\n\n## Voice\n\nCable Communications competes with wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, including incumbent local exchange carriers  ('ILECs')  and  competitive  local  exchange  carriers  ('CLECs'),  and  other  internet-based  and  VoIP  service  providers. Certain wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, such as the ILECs AT&amp;T and Verizon, have longstanding customer relationships,  and  extensive  existing  facilities  and  network  rights-of-way. A  few  CLECs  also  have  existing  local  networks  and significant  financial  resources.  In  addition,  we  are  increasingly  competing  with  other  telecommunications  service  providers  as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internet-based phone services.\n\n## Wireless\n\nCable  Communications competes with national  wireless  service  providers  in  the  United  States,  including AT&amp;T, T-Mobile  and Verizon,  which  offer  wireless  service  on  both  a  stand-alone  basis  or  along  with  other  services  as  bundled  offerings,  as  well  as regional wireless service providers.\n\n## Business Services\n\nCable  Communications  primarily  competes  with  a  variety  of  wireline  telecommunications  companies,  including  ILECs  and CLECs, and wide area network managed service providers. These companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier's network. We also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses and VoIP companies that target businesses of all sizes.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCable Communications competes for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital, radio and print media. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by declines in audience ratings and television viewership  and  difficulty  in  measuring  fragmented  audiences.  Cable  Communications  advertising  is  sold  to  local,  regional  and national advertisers, and competition is affected by the market conditions in the specific geographies in which we operate.\n\n## NBCUniversal Segments\n\nNBCUniversal  is  one  of  the  world's  leading  media  and  entertainment  companies  that  develops,  produces  and  distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks in the United States and Asia.\n\n## Media Segment\n\nNBCUniversal's television and streaming platforms primarily comprise our Media segment, including:\n\n- National, regional and international cable networks\n- NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations\n- Peacock, our DTC streaming service\n\nNBCUniversal distributes  a  wide  variety  of  content  to  appeal  to  consumers  with  varying  preferences  across  demographics  and geographies through our portfolio of television networks and streaming platforms. This content includes programming owned by NBCUniversal and by third parties who license it to us for distribution.\n\nMedia  segment  revenue  is  primarily  generated  from  the  sale  of  advertising  on  our  television  networks,  Peacock  and  digital properties, and from the distribution of our television and streaming platform programming.\n\nOur advertising sales are affected by the prices we charge for each advertising unit, which are generally based on the size and demographics of our viewing audiences, audience ratings on our television networks, the number of advertising units we can place in our programming and on our digital properties, and our ability to sell our advertising across our platforms.\n\nWe market and distribute cable network programming in the United States and internationally to multichannel video providers, including  both  traditional  providers  of  linear  programming  and  virtual  providers  who  provide  streaming  services  for  linear programming.  We  also  receive  fees  from  multichannel  video  providers  under  NBC  and  Telemundo  retransmission  consent agreements and associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. Our programming distribution agreements are generally multiyear agreements with revenue based on the number of subscribers",

      "question": "How did NFLX's pandemic-related challenges in merchandise sales compare to DIS's DPEP segment's ability to maintain revenue from merchandise and IP licensing in 2022, and what does this suggest about their respective exposure to consumer discretionary spending volatility?",
      "answer": "NFLX faced significant disruptions in merchandise sales due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including production delays, supply chain issues, and reduced consumer demand for physical goods tied to delayed or underperforming content. This negatively impacted their ability to generate consistent merchandise revenue. In contrast, DIS's DPEP segment reported $5,550 million in revenue for fiscal year 2022, a figure that remained unchanged from the prior year, indicating relative stability in its merchandise and IP licensing revenue despite broader economic pressures. The DPEP segment generates revenue from the sale of branded merchandise and royalties from licensing IP for consumer goods, which appears to have been more resilient compared to NFLX's merchandise sales, which were more directly affected by content availability and consumer mobility constraints. This suggests that DIS's DPEP revenue stream is less sensitive to content production disruptions and may offer more stability compared to NFLX's merchandise model, which is more closely tied to original programming cycles and broader pandemic-related uncertainties.",

The full extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the effect on our members and consumer demand for and ability to pay for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees' ability to work and travel; and any stoppages, disruptions or increased costs associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original programming. Such production pauses have in the past, and may in the future, cause us to delay content releases and temporarily to have less new content available on our service in subsequent quarters. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions can result in additional costs to production, including additional pay to cast and crew. Also, Covid-related delays and production protocols and requirements, including use of PPE and testing, add to costs of production.\n\nWe will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, members, partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\nIn addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global economy may continue to be impacted as a result of the actions taken in response to COVID-19. To the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers' ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors' ability to provide services to us, especially those related to our content productions, we could see our business and results of operations negatively impacted.\n\n## We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we have expanded our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk, which risks have been heightened during Covid-19. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.  We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

      "question": "How does Disney's growth in subscription fees driven by higher effective rates compare with Netflix's debt financing strategy, given the role of issuance costs in effective borrowing rates across both companies?",
      "answer": "Disney reported a 10% increase in subscription fees attributable to higher effective rates due to retail pricing, indicating that rate increases are a key lever for revenue growth in their streaming business. Meanwhile, Netflix disclosed $14,543 million in outstanding notes net of $65 million in issuance costs, with interest payable semi-annually at fixed rates. Cisco's disclosure shows that effective borrowing rates include both interest and issuance costs, meaning that higher issuance costs can increase the effective rate on debt. This suggests that while Disney benefits from higher effective rates on the revenue side through pricing power, Netflix \u2014 like other streaming companies \u2014 must balance debt financing needs with the cost implications of issuance expenses on effective borrowing rates, particularly in a high-content-investment, capital-intensive industry.",

Higher segment operating results reflecting growth at DPEP, partially offset by lower operating results at DMED.\n\n## Revenues\n\nService revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 20%, or $12.4 billion, to $74.2 billion, due to increased revenues at our theme parks and resorts, higher DTC subscription revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher theatrical distribution and advertising revenue. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in revenue for amounts to early terminate certain license agreements with a customer for film and television content, which was delivered in previous years, in order for the Company to use the content primarily on our DTC services (Content License Early Termination). The increase at theme parks and resorts was due to higher volumes, which generally reflected the impact of operating with capacity restrictions in the prior year as a result of COVID-19, and higher average per capita ticket revenue. The increase in DTC subscription revenue was due to subscriber growth and higher average rates.\n\nProduct revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 51%, or $2.9 billion, to $8.5 billion, due to higher sales volumes of merchandise, food and beverage at our theme parks and resorts.\n\n## Costs and expenses\n\nCost of services for fiscal 2022 increased 19%, or $7.8 billion, to $49.0 billion, due to higher programming and production costs, increased volumes at our theme parks and resorts and higher technical support costs at Direct-to-Consumer. The increase in programming and production costs was due to higher costs at Direct-to-Consumer, increased sports programming costs and an increase in production cost amortization due to theatrical revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by lower programming and production costs as a result of international channel closures.\n\nCost of products for fiscal 2022 increased 36%, or $1.4 billion, to $5.4 billion, due to higher merchandise, food and beverage sales at our theme parks and resorts.\n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2022 increased 21%, or $2.9 billion, to $16.4 billion, primarily due to higher marketing costs at our DTC and, to a lesser extent, theatrical distribution and parks and experiences businesses.\n\n## Restructuring and Impairment Charges\n\nRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2022 were $0.2 billion primarily due to the impairment of an intangible and other assets related to our businesses in Russia. We may incur additional charges to exit these businesses, which are not anticipated to be material.\n\nRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2021 were $0.7 billion due to $0.4 billion of asset impairments and severance costs related to the shut-down of an animation studio and the closure of a substantial number of Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe and $0.3 billion of severance and other costs in connection with the integration of TFCF and workforce reductions at DPEP.\n\n## Other Income (expense), net\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2024, tax incentives reduced Netflix's content amortization by approximately $899 million. This aligns with Comcast's treatment of tax incentives, where they similarly reduce capitalized film and television costs upon reasonable assurance of collection, with the corresponding amortization impact factored into programming and production costs. Both companies reflect this benefit as a direct offset to content amortization, which influences their respective operating margins\u2014Netflix reported a 27% operating margin in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Telev ision Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Business\n\n## Overview\n\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\n\nWe build technology that helps people connect and share, find and build communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people to connect and share  with  friends  and  family  through  mobile  devices,  personal  computers,  virtual  reality  (V R)  and  mix ed  reality  (MR)  headsets,  augmented  reality  (AR),  and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos, videos, and other content with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented, mixed, and virtual reality to help build the next computing platform. Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\n\nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery engine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn, get things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.\n\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.\n\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery engine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure capacity.\n\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts. This includes developing virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many products may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the next computing platform will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the nex t computing platform is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.",

      "answer": "T's Communications Segment was solely responsible for all of its segment operating income in 2023, amounting to $27,801 million, indicating a high concentration of profitability within this single segment. In contrast, VZ evaluates its segment performance by excluding special items that the chief operating decision maker does not consider relevant due to their nature, and subsequently reconciles these segment results to consolidated financial information. This suggests that while T's profitability is heavily concentrated and transparently tied to one segment, VZ applies a more nuanced and adjusted approach to assessing segment performance before consolidating results.",

In contrast, NFLX depreciates buildings and improvements over 30 years, with a net book value of $1,593,756 thousand as of December 31, 2024. While both companies manage long-lived assets, META's adjustment reflects a strategic shift in technology asset lifecycle planning, whereas NFLX maintains a more traditional, longer-term depreciation approach for physical infrastructure. The GILD evidence supports that buildings and improvements are typically depreciated over up to 35 years, aligning with NFLX's 30-year schedule, further highlighting the distinct asset classes and management philosophies between the two companies.",

These uncertain tax positions include our estimates related to uncertainties with our research and development tax credits that are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Similarly, our estimates for transfer pricing have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for income tax es. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax  outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income tax es in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Valuation of Assets\n\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment and assumptions such as estimation of future cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and companies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\n\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, occurs whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable compared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\n\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative is performed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity securities, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is  similar  to  the  non-marketable  equity  security  we  hold  may  require  judgment  in  (a)  assessment  of  differences  in  rights  and  obligations  associated  with  the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. The identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.\n\n## Change in Accounting Estimate\n\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full-year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion. For information regarding the change in useful lives of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

      "question": "How does T's decision to remove prior service credits from Mobility segment expenses impact the comparability of its wireless operating margins against VZ's Mobility-equivalent segment when considering VZ's special items adjustments?",
      "answer": "T's decision to remove prior service credits worth $2,400 million in 2022 and $2,100 million in 2021 from its Mobility segment expenses creates a structural reporting difference compared to VZ, which explicitly discloses that its segment operating results exclude special items like these. This means T's Mobility segment expenses appear higher on a reported basis than they would if these credits were included, while VZ's Segment Operating Revenues and expenses already factor in such adjustments. To properly compare wireless margins between the two companies, an analyst would need to add back these service credits to T's consolidated expenses or remove similar special items from VZ's figures, revealing a more accurate picture of operational performance in their respective Mobility/wireless businesses.",

        "Hop 3: Mobility \u2190 T: T stopped including prior service credits in its Mobility segment operating expenses and now records them at the consolidated level, aligning more closely with GAAP but diverging from how VZ reports its segment figures which already exclude such items."

In contrast, Comcast's total costs and expenses reached $100,434 million in 2024, which represents 81.2% of its $123,731 million revenue.

      "question": "How does the reliance of Meta's Family of Apps on advertising revenue, which accounted for the majority of its $116.61 billion total revenue in 2023, compare with Netflix's challenges in scaling its ad-supported model, given the risks Netflix highlights regarding advertiser retention and measurement tools?",
      "answer": "Meta's Family of Apps generated the majority of its $116.61 billion total revenue in 2023 from advertising, reflecting a mature and dominant ad platform across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party apps. In contrast, Netflix acknowledges significant risks in scaling its ad-supported model, including challenges in retaining advertisers, fluctuations in user engagement, and limitations in analytics tools that demonstrate ad value. These challenges suggest that while Meta's advertising business is well-established and central to its financial performance, Netflix's advertising revenue is still nascent and faces structural and competitive headwinds that could limit its growth trajectory.",

        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Family of Apps: Meta reports financial results by segment and generated $116.61 billion in total revenue in 2023, with the majority coming from its Family of Apps segment which includes advertising on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party apps.",
        "Hop 2: Family of Apps \u2192 Advertising Revenue: The Family of Apps segment is heavily monetized through advertising, which is the primary revenue driver for Meta, with ad revenue recognized based on impressions or user actions.",
        "Hop 3: Advertising Revenue \u2190 NFLX: Netflix faces risks in its ad-supported model, including advertiser retention, measurement tools, and user dissatisfaction, which could hinder the growth and effectiveness of its advertising revenue stream."

      "answer": "DIS reported an operating income of $328 million in 2024, reflecting a turnaround from the prior year's loss, largely driven by declines in revenue from TV/VOD, theatrical, and home entertainment distribution. In contrast, AT&T's Consumer Wireline segment reported $634 million in operating income for the same period, indicating stronger segment-level profitability. Given that AT&T uses discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches (Level 3 inputs) to assess the fair value of its reporting units, including Consumer Wireline, the relative financial performance suggests that DIS may face more pressure in its valuation modeling compared to AT&T\u2019s Consumer Wireline segment, which could be viewed more favorably in impairment or strategic assessments.",

        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 Operating Income (Loss): DIS reported an operating income of $328 million in 2024, a significant improvement from a $179 million loss in 2023, despite revenue declines across most distribution channels.",

Since the Entertainment segment is responsible for incurring these programming and production costs \u2014 which totaled $14,081 million in 2024 \u2014 this downward trend indicates a broader cost discipline strategy, especially in streaming. Given that Comcast holds a stake in this segment, this improved cost trajectory could enhance the segment's financial performance and long-term sustainability, potentially benefiting Comcast\u2019s investment returns and strategic alignment in the evolving entertainment landscape.",

(3)\n\nRestructuring and impairment charges in the prior year include the impact of a content license agreement termination with A+E, which generated a gain at A+E. The Company's 50% interest in this gain was $56 million (A+E gain) and is included in Restructuring and impairment charges in this table. (4)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenue and segment operating income.\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

Specifically, VZ evaluates industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, among other factors, during its qualitative impairment assessment for wireless licenses. T-Mobile\u2019s Mobility segment, which competes directly in the wireless space, reported an EBITDA margin of 39.1% in 2022, 40.9% in 2023, and 42.8% in 2024. These figures indicate a growing financial performance trend in the wireless sector, which VZ would consider when assessing the fair value and potential impairment of its own wireless licenses. Therefore, VZ's EBITDA margin guidance must be interpreted in the context of broader industry performance, including T-Mobile's strong EBITDA margin trajectory in its Mobility segment.",

While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten to fifteen years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. M oreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory , contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. A s a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network.\n\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitativ e  assessment  to  determine  whether  it  is  necessary  to  perform  a  quantitative  impairment  test.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.\n\nAs part of our qualitative assessment we consider several factors including the enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA  margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including the result of our last quantitativ e assessment. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests.\n\nOur quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A  discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized.\n\nInterest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.\n\nWireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets\n\nOur intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful liv es. A ll of our intangible assets subject to amortiz ation and other long-liv ed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment, if any . We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.\n\nSee Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or that contain a lease that is accounted for separately , we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use.\n\nFor both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability , which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of issuance costs in effective interest rates impact the long-term debt financing costs for Verizon's asset-backed securities compared to the effective rate increases that Disney cites as partially offsetting subscriber losses in ESPN revenue?",
      "answer": "Verizon's asset-backed debt financing includes issuance costs that are factored into the effective interest rates on the debt, which increases the overall cost of financing. In 2024, Verizon had $26.1 billion in asset-backed debt, and as disclosed, the effective rates on debt instruments include issuance costs, which are borne by the company. Meanwhile, Disney notes that higher effective rates contributed to a 7% increase in domestic ESPN affiliate revenue, partially offsetting subscriber losses. This suggests that while Disney benefits from higher effective rates in revenue generation, Verizon experiences higher financing costs due to the same metric being influenced by issuance expenses.",

In addition, for securities denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, net proceeds are shown on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis. See Note 9 for additional information on cross currency swap transactions related to the issuances. (1)\n\nAn amount equal to the net proceeds from these notes is expected to be used to fund, in whole or in part, certain renewable energy projects, including new and existing investments made by us during the period from M ay 1, 2023 through the maturity date of the notes. (2)\n\n## Commercial Paper Program\n\nIn 2024, we issued $27.5 billion in net proceeds and made $27.5 billion in principal repayments of commercial paper. These transactions are reflected within Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows on a net basis. A s of December 31, 2024, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\n\n## Asset-Backed Debt\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $26.1 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes A sset-Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-party investors (Investors) and loans (A BS Financing Facilities) received from banks and their conduit facilities (collectively , the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an A BS Entity , or collectively , the A BS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, Cellco Partnership (Cellco), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company , and certain other Company affiliates (collectively , the Originators) transfer device payment plan agreement receivables and certain other receivables (collectively referred to as certain receivables) or a participation interest in certain other receivables to one of the A BS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables and participation interest to another A BS Entity that issues the debt. V erizon entities retain the equity interests and residual interests, as applicable, in the A BS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related payments and expenses.\n\nOur asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred receivables and participation interest, and future collections on such receivables and underlying receivables related to such participation interest. These receivables and participation interest transferred to the A BS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of certain receivables and participation interest, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other  obligations  or  claims  of  V eriz on's  creditors  until  the  associated  asset-backed  debt  and  other  obligations  are  satisfied.  The  Inv estors  or  Banks,  as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do not have any recourse to V erizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, the Company has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the A BS Entities.\n\nCash collections on the receivables and on the underlying receivables related to the participation interest collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nProceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The assetbacked debt issued is included in Debt maturing within one year and Long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets.",

      "question": "How does Meta's investment in Reality Labs as a percentage of total costs compare with Comcast's programming expense allocation in 2023, and what might this indicate about their respective strategic priorities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Meta allocated 20% of its total costs and expenses ($18.02 billion out of $90.15 billion total) to Reality Labs, reflecting its strategic focus on developing metaverse technologies. Meanwhile, Comcast reported $18.5 billion in programming expenses as part of its $46.275 billion total costs and expenses, making programming costs 39.98% of its total costs. This indicates that while both companies are investing heavily in their core offerings\u2014Meta in immersive technologies and Comcast in content programming\u2014their strategic priorities differ significantly, with Meta prioritizing future tech development and Comcast focusing on traditional content delivery.",

Meanwhile, DIS specifically highlights that its Sports segment, which includes ESPN, incurs operating labor costs related to live sports and other live programming. However, while DIS breaks out specific live programming rights costs (e.g., for the NFL, NBA, and college sports), CMCSA does not provide a granular breakdown of labor costs tied to live content, which limits direct comparability. This difference in financial disclosure suggests that DIS may manage live programming labor expenses through structured rights agreements and dedicated network operations (e.g., ESPN\u2019s branded channels), whereas CMCSA may absorb these costs within broader programming and production categories, potentially affecting transparency for investors.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

(4)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenue and segment operating income.\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "At Company T, Business Wireline's segment operating income dropped significantly from $2,290 million in 2022 to $1,289 million in 2023, a decrease of 43.7%, which triggered impairment indicators and led to nonrecurring fair value measurements using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches. This decline suggests deteriorating performance that likely influenced goodwill and long-lived asset valuations. Meanwhile, Company VZ also discloses segment operating income but adjusts it for special items that the chief operating decision maker excludes when assessing performance. Therefore, while T's Business Wireline segment is under financial stress and subject to impairment analysis, VZ's approach to segment operating income reflects a different treatment that excludes certain items for internal performance evaluation, indicating potentially different financial strategies or reporting philosophies between the two companies.",

This suggests T may prioritize market presence or growth potential over immediate profitability in Latin America, whereas VZ would likely deprioritize underperforming segments unless they align with long-term strategic goals like geographic expansion or network integration.

When assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources, the CODM  focuses on evaluating whether revenues generated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate return on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM  using segment operating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network technologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's priorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks, establishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions, branding matters and people management.\n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:",

      "question": "How does the role of advertising revenue in DIS's Sports segment compare to the strategic importance of advertising in NFLX's subscription model based on their 2024 filings?",
      "answer": "In DIS's 2024 filings, advertising is a core revenue component of the Sports segment, listed alongside affiliate fees, subscription fees, and pay-per-view fees as a primary source of income. In contrast, NFLX's 2024 filing highlights advertising as part of its ad-supported subscription plan, where it plays an enabling role by offering a lower-cost tier to attract a broader customer base, rather than being a standalone revenue pillar. This reflects differing strategic uses of advertising: DIS treats it as a direct revenue generator, while NFLX leverages it to enhance subscriber acquisition and pricing flexibility.",

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix , Inc. ('Netflix ', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approx imately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We aim to offer a range of pricing plans, including our ad-supported subscription plan, to meet a variety of consumer needs. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers' leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\n\n## SEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.",

      "answer": "NBCUniversal, a segment of CMCSA, generates revenue from monthly subscription fees received from Peacock subscribers, with fees tied to multiyear agreements and recognized as programming is provided on a monthly basis. In contrast, Disney's Direct-to-Consumer segment not only generates revenue from subscription fees but also allocates programming and production costs across distribution platforms based on the estimated relative value of distribution windows. This nuanced cost allocation methodology at Disney directly ties to how content is distributed across its platforms, whereas Comcast's Peacock appears to focus more on the contractual and payment terms of subscription fees without explicit reference to a similar distribution window-based cost allocation framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## NBCUniversal Segments\n\n## Advertising\n\nMedia generates revenue from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and digital properties.\n\nWe enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed  upon,  typically  when  the  number  of  advertising  units  is  specifically  identified  and  the  timing  of  airing  is  scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days. In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in  contracts  where  the  ratings  were  guaranteed,  a  portion  of  the  revenue  is  deferred  until  the  shortfall  is  settled,  typically  by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nMedia  generates  revenue  from  the  distribution  of  cable  network  programming  in  the  United  States  and  internationally  to multichannel  video  providers,  including  both  traditional  providers  of  linear  programming  and  virtual  providers  who  provide streaming services for linear programming. Media also generates revenue from the fees received from multichannel video providers under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements and associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local  broadcast  television  stations. Additionally,  Media  generates  revenue  from  monthly  subscription  fees  received  from  certain Peacock subscribers.\n\nMonthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally under multiyear agreements and based on the number of subscribers. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment  within  60  days.  These  arrangements  are  accounted  for  as  licenses  of  functional  intellectual  property  and  revenue  is recognized as programming is provided on a monthly basis.\n\n## Content Licensing\n\nStudios generates revenue from the licensing of our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally to cable, broadcast and premium networks and to DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand and pay-perview services. Media also generates revenue from licensing of our owned television content, which is reported in other revenue. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film's theatrical release, Studios may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\n\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue at the later of when the content is available or when the renewal or extension period begins. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount  of  future  revenue  to  be  earned  related  to  fixed  pricing  under  existing  third-party  agreements  at  any  given  time  equals approximately one half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this  future  revenue. The  majority  of  this  revenue  will  be  recognized  within  2  years. This  amount  may  fluctuate  from  period  to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\n\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a DTC streaming service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\n\n## Theatrical\n\nStudios generates revenue from the worldwide theatrical release of produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. Our arrangements with exhibitors generally entitle us to a percentage of ticket sales. We recognize revenue as the films are viewed and exhibited in theaters and payment generally occurs within 30 days after exhibition.\n\n## Home Entertainment\n\nStudios generates revenue from the sale of our produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Media also generates revenue from the sale of owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services, which is reported in other revenue. We generally recognize revenue from DVD sales, net of estimated returns and customer incentives, on the date that DVDs are delivered to and made available for sale by retailers. Payment terms generally include payment within 60 to 90 days from delivery to the retailer.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

Land  and  assets  held  within construction in progress (CIP) are not depreciated. CIP assets are related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. We also capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the related assets.\n\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\n\n## Lease Obligations\n\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain data centers, offices, and colocations. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate tax es, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase arrangements, and maintenance and utilities.  Such variable lease costs are ex pensed as incurred on our consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\n\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability  of  ex ercising  such  options,  we  consider  contract-based,  asset-based,  entity-based,  and  market-based  factors.  We  do  not  assume  renewals  in  our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\n\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net impairment losses of $383 million, $2.43 billion, and $2.22 billion, respectively, in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining  lease  periods,  and  discount  rates  that  reflect  the  level  of  risk  associated  with  receiving  future  cash  flows.  For  additional  information  regarding  our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 - Restructuring.",

      "answer": "NFLX's total contributions to employee benefits decreased significantly from $224,170 thousand in 2022 to $142,442 thousand in 2023, a drop of over $81 million. This indicates a reduction in the company's financial commitment to employee benefits over this period. In contrast, T maintains a structured contributory savings plan where it matches a stated percentage of eligible employee contributions, funded either through company stock or cash, with benefit costs of $570 million in 2023, $611 million in 2022, and $614 million in 2021. Unlike NFLX, T's contributions have remained relatively stable year-over-year, suggesting a more consistent investment in employee benefits. This comparison reveals differing strategies: NFLX appears to be scaling back on benefits spending, while T maintains a steady matching contribution, potentially signaling stronger emphasis on employee retention and satisfaction.",

      "answer": "Netflix reported that tax incentives reduced content amortization on produced content by $835 million in 2023 and $719 million in 2022, resulting in a $116 million decrease year-over-year. Disney also utilizes tax incentives from U.S. and foreign agencies, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs, thereby lowering programming and production costs over the asset's amortization period. Both companies benefit from these incentives, but Netflix's benefit is quantifiably larger in absolute terms based on the disclosed figures.",

      "answer": "Disney's $487 million decrease in SG&A costs was driven by fewer theatrical releases, which directly reduced marketing expenses. This reflects a strategic shift toward optimizing content distribution, likely prioritizing streaming platforms like Disney+ over theatrical releases. In contrast, AT&T reduced marketing costs as part of broader operational efficiency efforts, including automation and digitization, in response to declining service revenues from legacy offerings such as voice and data. While both companies cut marketing spend, Disney's reduction was tied to content strategy shifts, whereas AT&T's was part of a cost rationalization program to align operations with strategic direction.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 SG&A Costs: Disney's SG&A costs decreased by $487 million, largely due to reduced theatrical marketing spend linked to fewer significant film releases.",

      "answer": "Disney reported higher selling, general, and administrative costs of $2.9 billion in fiscal 2022, partly due to integration-related expenses tied to acquisitions like TFCF, which directly increased its operating costs. In contrast, Google's pro forma results for the Fitbit acquisition and other deals explicitly excluded integration impacts and cost synergies, suggesting a cleaner baseline for evaluating acquisition performance. This difference in reporting highlights how Disney's financial statements reflect the full cost of integration, while Google's pro forma results provide a hypothetical view without these expenses, potentially showing better short-term financial performance post-acquisition.",

Higher segment operating results reflecting growth at DPEP, partially offset by lower operating results at DMED.\n\n## Revenues\n\nService revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 20%, or $12.4 billion, to $74.2 billion, due to increased revenues at our theme parks and resorts, higher DTC subscription revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher theatrical distribution and advertising revenue. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in revenue for amounts to early terminate certain license agreements with a customer for film and television content, which was delivered in previous years, in order for the Company to use the content primarily on our DTC services (Content License Early Termination). The increase at theme parks and resorts was due to higher volumes, which generally reflected the impact of operating with capacity restrictions in the prior year as a result of COVID-19, and higher average per capita ticket revenue. The increase in DTC subscription revenue was due to subscriber growth and higher average rates.\n\nProduct revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 51%, or $2.9 billion, to $8.5 billion, due to higher sales volumes of merchandise, food and beverage at our theme parks and resorts.\n\n## Costs and expenses\n\nCost of services for fiscal 2022 increased 19%, or $7.8 billion, to $49.0 billion, due to higher programming and production costs, increased volumes at our theme parks and resorts and higher technical support costs at Direct-to-Consumer. The increase in programming and production costs was due to higher costs at Direct-to-Consumer, increased sports programming costs and an increase in production cost amortization due to theatrical revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by lower programming and production costs as a result of international channel closures.\n\nCost of products for fiscal 2022 increased 36%, or $1.4 billion, to $5.4 billion, due to higher merchandise, food and beverage sales at our theme parks and resorts.\n\nSelling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2022 increased 21%, or $2.9 billion, to $16.4 billion, primarily due to higher marketing costs at our DTC and, to a lesser extent, theatrical distribution and parks and experiences businesses.\n\n## Restructuring and Impairment Charges\n\nRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2022 were $0.2 billion primarily due to the impairment of an intangible and other assets related to our businesses in Russia. We may incur additional charges to exit these businesses, which are not anticipated to be material.\n\nRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2021 were $0.7 billion due to $0.4 billion of asset impairments and severance costs related to the shut-down of an animation studio and the closure of a substantial number of Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe and $0.3 billion of severance and other costs in connection with the integration of TFCF and workforce reductions at DPEP.\n\n## Other Income (expense), net\n\n",

Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining  our  2016  through  2021  tax  returns.

There are other ongoing audits in v arious other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\n\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adv erse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our prov ision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in v arious taxing jurisdictions.\n\nWe believe that an adequate prov ision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. Howev er, the outcome of tax audits  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are  resolv ed  in  a  manner  not  consistent  with  management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our prov ision for  income taxes in the period such resolutions occur.

This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\n\n## We face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical ex perience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical ex perience. For ex ample, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor's subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

      "question": "How did the growth in Disney's Consumer Products Business in 2022 compare with the recovery trajectory of Comcast's Theme Parks Segment, given both companies' reliance on in-park and related consumer spending?",
      "answer": "Disney's Consumer Products Business contributed to a $7,434 million increase in segment operating income, driven in part by higher volumes and marketing spend. Meanwhile, Comcast's Theme Parks Segment, which includes revenue from parks like Universal Orlando and the newly opened Universal Beijing Resort, saw a recovery from pandemic closures and capacity restrictions, with operations gradually returning to full capacity by mid-2021. However, Comcast reported only $2 million in revenue specifically attributed to the Theme Parks Segment in 2021, suggesting a much slower or more limited recovery compared to Disney\u2019s broader consumer and in-park growth. This contrast highlights differing recovery dynamics despite both segments relying on consumer spending in and around theme parks.",

In contrast, GOOGL reported $4.2 billion in short-term income taxes payable and included EC fines totaling \u20ac7.6 billion (approximately $8.5 billion) in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, primarily due to legal and regulatory obligations rather than workforce restructuring.

      "question": "How does the 2.7% year-over-year revenue growth in AT&T's Mobility segment compare to Verizon's treatment of Segment Operating Revenues in its consolidated financial reporting, particularly in light of AT&T's decision to reclassify prior service credits out of the Mobility segment?",
      "answer": "AT&T's Mobility segment reported $83,982 million in Segment Operating Revenues for 2023, reflecting a 2.7% increase from 2022. This growth followed a reclassification that removed prior service credits from the Mobility segment and instead recorded them as other income on a consolidated basis, which increased Mobility\u2019s reported operating expenses by $2,400 million in 2022. Meanwhile, Verizon also reports Segment Operating Revenues but reconciles these to consolidated results by excluding special items that the chief operating decision maker does not consider in assessing segment performance. This suggests both companies manage internal segment reporting differently, with AT&T adjusting segment-level costs retroactively and Verizon explicitly reconciling segment revenues to consolidated figures to reflect non-core adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AT&T \u2192 Mobility: AT&T's Mobility segment is a key contributor to its Communications segment, with 2023 revenues of $83,982 million, and underwent a reclassification of prior service credits that impacted historical segment expense reporting.",
        "Hop 2: Mobility \u2192 Segment Operating Revenues: The Mobility segment saw a 2.7% year-over-year revenue growth from 2022 to 2023, with the reclassification increasing its 2022 operating expenses by $2,400 million.",
        "Hop 3: Segment Operating Revenues \u2190 Verizon: Verizon reports Segment Operating Revenues but reconciles them to consolidated revenues by excluding special items not considered in assessing segment performance, indicating a different approach to segment transparency."

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, ex cept it ex cludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title's unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the ex tent the title's unamortized costs ex ceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.\n\n## Content Production Incentives\n\nThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S. (state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content. The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as 'Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset's amortization period.\n\n## Internal-Use Software Costs\n\nThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.\n\n## Parks, Resorts and Other Property\n\nParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n",

      "answer": "The $56 million gain from the A+E content license agreement termination partially offset restructuring and impairment charges within the Entertainment segment, reducing the net impact of distribution-related costs. The Entertainment segment explicitly includes distribution costs in its operating expenses, which encompass programming, production, and technology support costs. Meanwhile, CMCSA distinguishes between capitalized and non-capitalized distribution costs, where only non-capitalized costs (such as marketing and distribution expenses tied to theatrical releases or licensing) are excluded from amortization and treated as period expenses. This suggests that while T's Entertainment segment absorbs distribution costs directly into operations, CMCSA strategically separates and defers certain distribution costs based on monetization strategies and amortization methods.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Telev ision Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

For more information about our company's operations and the risks facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors, respectively. As discussed in Note 2, we changed the presentation of our segment operating results in 2021, and all amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Refer to Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, with the exception of the discussion and analysis related to our NBCUniversal segments, which is included below for all periods based on the updated segment structure.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications;  (2)  NBCUniversal  in  three  reportable  business  segments:  Media,  Studios  and  Theme  Parks  (collectively,  the 'NBCUniversal segments'); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment.\n\n## 2021 Developments\n\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2021:\n\n## Cable Communications\n\n- Revenue increased 7.1% to $64.3 billion, reflecting increases in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video and other revenue, partially offset by a decline in voice revenue.\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2% to $28.1 billion primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by increases in programming and technical and product support expenses.\n- Operating margin increased from 42.1% to 43.7%.",

      "answer": "DPEP allocated capital expenditures toward theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, and systems infrastructure, with a segment balance of $5.550 billion in fiscal 2022. This spending was notably driven by cruise ship fleet expansion at domestic parks. In contrast, CMCSA capitalized costs related to cable transmission and distribution facilities, customer premise equipment deployment, and service installation, using accounting standards specific to cable television companies. CMCSA also reported separate capital expenditures for the Universal Beijing Resort construction, indicating a focus on both core network infrastructure and major venue development. The $5.550 billion balance in DPEP highlights a significant allocation to physical and experiential assets, while CMCSA\u2019s capitalization strategy emphasizes network scalability and customer connectivity.",

      "answer": "T's DTC segment showed strong subscription revenue growth, reaching $7,723 million in 2021, driven by HBO Max and HBO subscriber growth, suggesting a more stable revenue model. In contrast, DIS's DTC business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales, and Premier Access fees, with advertising sales also being a key component of their Linear Networks business. DIS explicitly notes that advertising market conditions are a risk factor, with volatility potentially impacting their DTC services and linear networks. This implies that DIS may face greater revenue volatility due to advertising market fluctuations compared to T's more subscription-driven DTC model.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

      "answer": "NFLX's cloud infrastructure strategy relies on Google Cloud, which incurs direct costs that include third-party services fees. GOOGL reported a $698 million increase in these fees as part of its broader R&D expense growth. This suggests rising costs within Google Cloud\u2019s operations, which could be passed on to partners like NFLX through higher service pricing. If NFLX depends heavily on Google Cloud for scalable infrastructure, this fee increase may pressure its content delivery and operational costs, prompting a reassessment of cloud vendor diversification or cost negotiation strategies.",

      "answer": "VZ's Business segment revenue declined in 2024, negatively impacting its consolidated operating revenue, while T reported a 7.2% year-over-year increase in broadband operating revenue, indicating divergent performance in segments exposed to similar enterprise and commercial telecommunications demand.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: VZ \u2192 Business Segment: VZ's Business segment faced revenue declines in 2024, despite growth in wireless and FWA, due to continued secular pressures on legacy wireline services.",
        "Hop 2: Business Segment \u2192 Operating Revenue: These Business segment revenue declines directly negatively impacted VZ's consolidated operating revenue.",
        "Hop 3: Operating Revenue \u2190 T: In contrast, T reported a 7.2% year-over-year increase in broadband operating revenue in 2024, a key component of its overall enterprise-focused service offerings."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn addition, in both our Consumer and our Business segments, we expect to support connection growth in part by adding capacity and further expanding our wireless coverage, and by continuing the build-out and densification of our 5G network.\n\n## Service Revenue Trends\n\nIn our Consumer segment, we expect continued growth in our wireless service revenue, driven by targeted pricing actions, migrations to higher priced plans, increased offering of perks, and increases in FWA  connections and revenue, offset in part by higher promotion amortization impacts in 2025. Our efforts to maintain and grow our customer base and make improvements to our prepaid business, if successful, are also expected to benefit our wireless service revenue. We expect Fios revenue to benefit from growth in our Fios customer base and an ongoing demand for higher speed internet connections, which offsets the impact of the shift from bundled wireline services to standalone internet service.\n\nIn our Business segment, we expect wireless service revenue to expand, driven by growth from an increase in wireless volumes and strong FWA  revenue. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth and that legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures.\n\n## Other Trends\n\nWe are focused on achieving profitable growth as we continue to deliver strong revenues and undertake initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including through A I-driven technologies.\n\nWe expect that our ability to generate cash flows will benefit from our expected service revenue growth, despite the moderate expected increase in our 2025 capital program compared to 2024. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information on our capital program.\n\nIn the course of business, we make promotional equipment offers to attract and retain customers. In 2024, the growth of our wireless service revenue was unfavorably impacted by the amortization of wireless equipment sales and promotions. We expect these pressures to continue and increase in 2025. In addition, in 2023 and 2024, we had fewer phone upgrades compared to prior years. T o the extent upgrade volumes increase in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe use the net cash generated from our operations to invest in new businesses and spectrum, fund expansion and modernization of our networks, pay dividends, service and repay external financing and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary , from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance is $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally , and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity . See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout M arket Risk\" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.\n\nWe expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, including, for example, to complete our acquisition of Frontier, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our ex ternal financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nOur 2025 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding and adding capacity and density to our core networks, the ongoing deployment of C-Band spectrum, and advancing our network architecture. It will also support our broadband expansion plans including the launch of our fixed wireless access solution for multi-dwelling units. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2025 capital program to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion.\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nWe have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n\n- Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $142.2 billion, of which $21.7 billion (including $3.3 billion of unsecured debt) are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Related interest payments are $66.3 billion, of which $5.8 billion, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.",

In contrast, Comcast separately discloses programming and production costs (Note 4) but does not specify a similar allocation methodology, suggesting a potentially different approach to segment cost reporting.",

While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\n## Seasonality and other\n\nOur  advertising  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and underlying  business  trends,  such  as  traditional  retail  seasonality.  Additionally,  our  non-advertising  revenues,  including those  generated  from  Google  Cloud,  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube,  may  be  affected  by  fluctuations  driven  by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\n\n## Revenues and Monetization Metrics\n\n## Google Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising ('Google advertising') as well as revenues from other sources ('Google other revenues').\n\n## Google Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and",

      "question": "Given META's $70.13 billion investment in its Family of Apps segment in 2023, which drives advertising revenue, how does this financial strategy position META differently compared to DIS in terms of sensitivity to economic downturns, considering DIS has disclosed that declines in economic conditions adversely affect advertising revenue?",
      "answer": "META's $70.13 billion investment in its Family of Apps segment in 2023, which is responsible for generating substantially all of its advertising revenue, indicates a strong reliance on digital platforms that may be more resilient during economic downturns due to their global scale and digital nature. In contrast, DIS disclosed that declines in economic conditions, such as recessions or inflationary pressures, have a direct adverse impact on advertising revenue, particularly in areas like parks and resorts where discretionary spending is more sensitive to economic volatility. This suggests that while META's app-centric advertising model may benefit from broader digital reach and lower cost structures, DIS's advertising revenue is more exposed to macroeconomic fluctuations, especially in physical and consumer-facing segments.",

In contrast, Verizon takes a broader approach, tracking net additions across both wireless retail postpaid accounts and total broadband connections. Verizon\u2019s disclosures emphasize metrics like wireless retail postpaid churn, ARPA, and connections per account, reflecting a diversified connectivity strategy that also includes Fios broadband and Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) services over its 5G and 4G LTE networks.",
