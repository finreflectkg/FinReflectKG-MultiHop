Verizon recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion in 2021 from the divestiture of its Verizon Media Group, highlighting its strategic refocusing on core telecommunications and wireless services.

COF reports a foreign currency translation adjustment of $3 million as of December 31, 2024, indicating a slight positive impact on its Total AOCI of $(9,286) million. PG shows a significant negative foreign currency translation adjustment of $(12,522) million as of June 30, 2024, which constitutes the largest component of its Total AOCI of $(11,900) million.

      "answer": "CMCSA expenses advertising costs as incurred, reflecting a straightforward operational approach typical in media and entertainment. JNJ reports advertising expenses as part of selling, marketing, and administrative expenses, with specific amounts of $0.6 billion, $0.5 billion, and $0.7 billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, indicating a relatively stable investment in brand promotion within the healthcare sector. PEP, operating in the consumer goods space, allocates advertising and marketing expenses using an interim forecasting methodology and reports total advertising expenses of $3.9 billion, $3.8 billion, and $3.5 billion for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, showing a more dynamic and volume-driven approach to marketing spend. Together, these disclosures highlight how advertising is treated differently across industries\u2014CMCSA with immediate expensing, JNJ with consistent annual investment, and PEP with forecast-based allocation\u2014revealing distinct financial and operational strategies aligned with their respective sector norms.",

The  related  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  as  a  component  of accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Any  foreign  currency  transaction  gains  or  losses  are  included  in  our consolidated statements of income in investment and other income (loss), net. For disclosures containing future amounts where the functional currency is the local currency, we translate the amounts into U.S. dollars at the ex change rates as of the balance sheet date.\n\nIn November 2024, we announced our intention to create SpinCo, a new independent publicly traded company comprised of select domestic cable television networks along with complementary digital assets through a tax-free spin-off. We are targeting to complete the Spin-off by the end of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including obtaining final approval from our Board of Directors, satisfactory completion of SpinCo financings, receipt of tax opinions and receipt of any regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that a separation transaction will occur, or, if one does, of its terms or timing. The consolidated financial statements and related notes do not reflect the proposed Spin-off.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nOur current liability for accrued participations and residuals is separately disclosed in Note 4 in the current year and is included within the 'accrued expenses and other current liabilities' caption in our consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented. Previously these amounts were presented in a separate caption in our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to select accounting policies, including in certain cases industryspecific policies, and make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and ex penses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following accounting policies are specific to the industries in which we operate:\n\n- capitalization and amortization of film and television costs (see Note 4)\n- costs for connecting customers to our HFC network (see Note 8)\n\nInformation on other accounting policies and methods that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are included, where applicable, in their respective footnotes that follow. Below is a discussion of accounting policies and methods used in our consolidated financial statements that are not presented within other footnotes.\n\n## Advertising Expenses\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe accounting guidance related to fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques. The levels of the hierarchy are described below.\n\n- Level 1: Values are determined using quoted market prices for identical financial instruments in an active market.\n- Level 2: V alues are determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.\n- Level 3: V alues are determined using models that use significant inputs that are primarily unobservable, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nWe use this three-tier fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of certain financial instruments on a recurring basis, such as for investments (see Note 7); on a non-recurring basis, such as for acquisitions and impairment testing (see Note 9); and for disclosure purposes, such as for debt (see Note 6). Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation and classification within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. A dvertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $0.6 billion, $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GA A P accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\n\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GA A P which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. M anagement believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs A ct (TCJA ). This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in fiscal year 2018 and will continue through 2025. The final payment of $2.5 billion will be made in fiscal year 2025.\n\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder's total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA . In January 2018, the FA SB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., 'period cost') or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that ex ist and are ex pected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., 'deferred method'). The Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\n\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax  effect of this repatriation would be approx imately  $0.5 billion under currently  enacted tax  laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.\n\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n## Net earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n55",

      "answer": "Bank of America (BAC) reveals that changes in credit spreads, default rates, and loss severities significantly affect the fair value of structured credit derivatives, with senior tranches being more sensitive to default correlation. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) notes that price changes of competitive products influence product return estimates, factored into their gross-to-net (GTN) sales adjustments and liabilities. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) highlights that foreign exchange rate fluctuations, particularly on euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps, directly impact their currency translation adjustments and overall financial performance. Together, these perspectives show that while BAC is exposed to credit market volatility through derivatives, BMY is sensitive to pricing dynamics in the pharmaceutical market, and TMO faces exposure through foreign exchange rate shifts, reflecting distinct sensitivities to price changes across different financial and operational domains.",

The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument.\n\nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The  sensitivity  of  th is  inp ut  on  th e  fa ir  va lue  va ries  d ep end ing  on  th e  level  of subordination  of  the  tranche.  For  senior  tranches  that  are  net  purchases  of protection, a significant increase in default correlation would have resulted in a significantly  higher  fair  value.  Net  sh ort  protection  positions  would  have  been impacted in a directionally opposite way.\n\nFor  equity  derivatives,  commodity  derivatives,  interest  rate  derivatives  and structured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between two different commodities, between two different interest rates, or between  interest  rates  and  foreign  exchange  rates)  would  have  resulted  in  a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact  depend  on  whether  the  Corporation  is  long  or  short  the  exposure.  For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value.\n\n## Nonrecurring Fair Value\n\nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring.

The non-U.S. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.\n\nEstimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loss of market exclusivity. Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.\n\n## Use of information from external sources\n\nInformation from external sources is used to estimate GTN adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers is based on the projected prescription demandbased sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.\n\nWe have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.\n\n## Acquisition and Intangible Assets Valuations\n\nWe make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations. If it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets. We evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities and assets. If the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business.\n\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Ex cess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Estimating fair value requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions.\n\nIn transactions accounted for as acquisitions of assets, no goodwill is recorded and contingent consideration, such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, generally is not recognized at the acquisition date. In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to IPRD projects at the acquisition date are ex pensed unless there is an alternative future use. In addition, product development milestones are ex pensed upon achievement.\n\nWe have identifiable intangible assets that are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. G enerally, we engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. The fair value of these assets is estimated using discounted cash flow models. These models required the use of the following significant estimates and assumptions among others:",

A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\nSee Note 1 and Note 3 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies.\n\n## Note 11.    Business Segment and Geographical Information\n\nThe company's financial performance is reported in four segments. A description of each segment follows.\n\nLife Sciences Solutions: provides an extensive portfolio of reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines as well as diagnosis of infection and disease. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agricultural, clinical, healthcare, academic, and government markets.\n\nAnalytical Instruments: provides a broad offering of instruments and the supporting consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory and in the field. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government, environmental and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory.\n\nSpecialty Diagnostics: offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products to serve customers in healthcare, clinical, pharmaceutical, industrial, and food safety laboratories. Our healthcare products are used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, which improves patient care in a more cost-efficient manner.\n\nLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services: offers virtually everything needed for the laboratory. Our unique combination of self-manufactured and sourced products and extensive service offering enables our customers to focus on their core activities and helps them to be more innovative, productive and cost-efficient. The segment also includes a comprehensive offering of outsourced services used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries for drug development, clinical research, clinical trials services and commercial drug manufacturing.\n\nThe company's management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, restructuring and other costs, and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments' core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.\n\nThe company's president, chairman and chief executive officer is its chief operating decision maker (CODM). The CODM uses total revenues and segment income predominantly in the strategic plan, annual operating plan and quarterly business review processes. During these processes, the CODM considers budget-to-actual variances to evaluate both internal (e.g., changes in selling prices, strategic growth investments, productivity, business mix , newly acquired/divested businesses, etc.) and ex ternal (e.g., inflation, foreign currency, etc.) events and conditions.\n\nThe company generally accounts for intersegment revenues at current market prices.\n\nOther segment items included in the below tables consist of stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation expenses, allocations of corporate expenses and certain overhead expenses as well as elimination of intersegment and intrasegment profits, all of which are included in the company's measurement of segment income, but not regularly provided to the CODM at the segment level. Cost of revenues adjustments consist of charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, inventory write-downs associated with large-scale abandonments of product lines, and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to estimated salvage value in connection with the consolidation of operations. Selling, general and administrative adjustments consist of significant transaction/integration costs (including reimbursement thereof) related to recent/terminated acquisitions, charges/credits for changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration, and charges related to product liability litigation. Restructuring and other costs include charges arising from headcount reductions and facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses on the sale of real estate and",

      "question": "How do ACN, AIG, and JNJ each reflect the impact of deferred tax expense or benefits in their 2022 financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their respective tax strategies and international operations?",
      "answer": "ACN reported a deferred tax expense of $213.3 million in 2022, indicating a shift from a benefit in prior years, suggesting changes in tax asset/liability timing or valuation allowances. AIG reported a deferred tax expense of $2.2 billion in 2021, contributing to a total income tax expense of $2.18 billion, reflecting significant deferred tax liabilities likely tied to complex insurance operations and asset/liability remeasurements. JNJ highlighted international tax planning benefits, including a $2.3 billion local deferred tax asset from asset remeasurements in fiscal 2021, offset in part by $1.7 billion in U.S. GILTI deferred tax expense. These differences suggest ACN experiences moderate tax timing shifts, AIG faces large deferred tax impacts from insurance liabilities and investments, and JNJ strategically leverages international tax structures to reduce effective tax rates.",

International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries; the 2020 and 2019 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which are further described below.\n\n(2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code. The 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries; the 2020 and 2019 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which is further described below.\n\n(3) Represents impact of adjustments to balances originally recorded as part of the 2017 TCJA provisional tax charge. Further information provided below.\n\nThe fiscal year 2021 tax rate decreased by 2.5% compared to the fiscal year 2020 tax rate, which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of certain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring was approximately $0.6 billion net benefit or 2.7% benefit to the Company's annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:\n\n- approximately $2.3 billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these assets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as 'International Operations' on the Company's effective tax rate reconciliation.\n- approximately $1.7 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as 'U.S. tax on international income' on the Company's effective tax rate reconciliation.\n\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3% which is reflected as a 'Tax benefits from loss on capital assets' on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally other fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows:\n\n- the Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $1.6 billion for talc at an effective tax rate of 23.5% and $0.8 billion for Risperdal settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).\n- the Company recorded a partial IPR&amp;D charge of $0.9 billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4% (See Notes 5 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).\n\nThe fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by 1.9% compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate. which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., 'step-up') to be depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.\n\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development",

      "question": "How do Salesforce (CRM), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Charles Schwab (SCHW) each reflect the financial impact of the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act, and what does this reveal about their respective capital allocation strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "Salesforce (CRM) notes that the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases, introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act, was applicable to repurchases made in fiscal 2024 and would impact fiscal 2025 financing cash flows. CRM had repurchased $4.0 billion of its common stock in fiscal 2023 under its Share Repurchase Program. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) mentions the excise tax in the context of its share repurchase disclosures, indicating awareness of the tax's applicability to net share repurchases effective January 1, 2023, and referencing its $30 billion repurchase program. Charles Schwab (SCHW) explicitly recognized the excise tax as a direct and incremental cost associated with repurchases in 2023, recording the tax as part of the cost basis for treasury stock repurchased, which had no impact on the consolidated statement of income. SCHW repurchased $2.8 billion of its common stock in 2023 under its $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization. Together, these disclosures reveal that while all three companies were subject to the excise tax, CRM and SCHW actively repurchased shares in 2023 despite the added cost, whereas JPM focused on disclosing the tax's implications without specifying actual repurchase amounts.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) classifies advertising costs as Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses and expenses them as incurred, while certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales. Altria (MO) treats consumer engagement programs as expenses included in marketing, administration, and research costs and expenses them as incurred, while consumer incentives and trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues. Charles Schwab (SCHW) includes client incentives and discounts as part of advertising and market development costs and expenses these when incurred. This reveals that CL and SCHW follow a similar approach of expensing marketing costs as incurred, while MO distinguishes between types of promotional activities, treating some as revenue reductions and others as operating expenses, indicating a more segmented approach to marketing cost accounting.",

          "chunk_text": "## COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Dollars in Millions Ex cept Share and Per Share Amounts)\n\n## Shipping and Handling Costs\n\nShipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) are classified as Selling, general and administrative ex penses and were $1,777, $1,771 and $1,874 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Marketing Costs\n\nThe Company markets its products through advertising and other promotional activities. Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of the remaining inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and E quipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.\n\nDetermining the fair value of the Company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates and the selection of royalty rates and discount rates. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nAs a result of a reporting structure realignment, the Company reallocated the goodwill of a certain reporting unit from the Europe segment to the North America segment. Before and after the reporting structure realignment, the Company completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment was required. Refer to Note 13, Segment Information for additional information.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.",

We use certain factors to make this determination including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nSee Note 8. Investments in Equity Securities for additional information on our accounting policy for our former investment in JUUL.\n\n- Litigation Contingencies and Costs: We record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We expense litigation defense costs as incurred and include these costs in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. See Note 20. Contingencies .\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred, and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Revenue Recognition: Our businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. While our businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type, all sales contracts are similarly structured. These contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer. Our businesses satisfy all performance obligations within one year; therefore, we expense costs to obtain contracts as incurred and do not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations. There is no financing component because our businesses expect, at contract inception, that the period between when our businesses transfer product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less.\n\nOur businesses define net revenues as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. Our businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\n\nOur businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer. Our businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer. Our businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings. Our businesses record an allowance for returned goods, based principally on historical volume and return rates, which is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. We include expected payments for sales incentives in accrued marketing liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nPayment terms vary depending on product type. Our businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue, which we include in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized. PM USA primarily receives payments in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product. USSTC, Helix and NJOY receive substantially all payments within one business day of a customer obtaining control of the product. We include amounts due from customers in receivables on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n- Supplier Financing: We facilitate a voluntary supplier financing program under which participating suppliers may elect to sell receivables due from us to a third-party financial institution. Our payments are made on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier, and we have no economic interest in a supplier's sale of a receivable. All outstanding balances under the supplier financing program are recorded in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per S hare Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Advertising and market development\n\nAdvertising and market development activities include the cost to produce and distribute marketing campaigns as well as client incentives and discounts. Where it applies to these costs, the Company's accounting policy is to expense when incurred.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nSchwab provides for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are adjusted to reflect the tax  rates at which future tax able amounts will likely be settled or realized. The effects of tax  rate changes on future deferred tax  assets and deferred tax liabilities, as well as other changes in income tax  laws, are recorded in earnings in the period such changes are enacted. Uncertain tax  positions are evaluated to determine whether they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. When tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, the difference between positions taken on tax return filings and estimated potential tax settlement outcomes are recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. If a position is not more likely than not to be sustained, then none of the tax  benefit is recognized in Schwab's financial statements. Accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in tax es on income. Schwab records amounts within AOCI net of taxes. Income tax effects are released from AOCI using the specific-identification method.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nShare-based compensation includes employee and board of director stock options and restricted stock units. Schwab measures compensation expense for these share-based payment arrangements based on their estimated fair values as of the grant date. The grant date fair value is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Share-based compensation expense is based on options or units expected to vest and therefore is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Per the Company's accounting policy election, forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and reviewed annually based on the Company's historical forfeiture ex perience. Share-based compensation expense is adjusted in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures. For sharebased payment awards with performance conditions, management assesses and estimates their expected level of achievement. Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on the level of achievement deemed probable and changes in the estimated outcome are reflected as a cumulative adjustment to expense in the period of the change in estimate. The excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the ex ercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units are recorded in taxes on income.\n\n## Derivative instruments and hedging activities\n\nThe Company utilizes derivative instruments as part of its interest rate risk management. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Accounting for the changes in the fair values of derivatives depends on whether we qualify for and elect to apply hedge accounting and the type of hedging accounting relationship applied. Hedge accounting generally matches the timing of gain or loss recognition on the derivatives with the recognition of the changes in the fair values or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. Economic hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, among other requirements, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing exposure to the hedged risk. The assessment of effectiveness is done for each hedging relationship at inception and on an ongoing basis. Depending on certain criteria, these assessments of effectiveness may be qualitative or quantitative. Schwab applies the 'shortcut method' of hedge accounting for a portion of its fair value hedges, which assumes perfect effectiveness. Alternatively, when quantitative effectiveness assessments are required, the Company uses regression analysis.\n\nFor the Company's fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivatives and the changes in fair values of the hedged assets and liabilities attributable to benchmark interest rates (basis adjustments) are both recorded in interest revenue or interest ex pense on the consolidated statements of income. If the hedging relationship is terminated, any remaining basis adjustment is included in the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability and amortized to interest revenue or interest expense over its remaining life as a yield adjustment. The Company does not amortize basis adjustments prior to termination of the hedging relationship.\n\nCertain fair value hedges may be designated under the portfolio layer method (PLM) of hedge accounting, which allows the Company to hedge the interest rate risk of prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets by designating a stated amount of a closed portfolio that is expected to be outstanding for the designated hedge period (a hedged layer) as the hedged item.

MRK incorporates expected benefit payments into its actuarial assumptions and uses them to measure net gain/loss amounts that flow into other comprehensive income, reflecting differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions. TXN selects its discount rate using a settlement approach involving a portfolio of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds that simulate cash flows to pay expected benefit payments, while for non-U.S. plans, it uses yield curves based on corporate or government bonds depending on market depth. Together, these approaches show varying degrees of specificity and methodology in how each company incorporates expected benefit payments into pension obligation calculations, with FDX focusing on bond yield alignment, MRK emphasizing variance tracking in OCI, and TXN applying a structured bond portfolio and yield curve methodology.",
